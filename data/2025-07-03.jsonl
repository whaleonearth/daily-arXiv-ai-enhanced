While\nrecent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic\nscenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically\nconsistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address\nthis, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D\nconsistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap\nalignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to\nlearn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future\nvideo sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D\nobservations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing\nbaselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned\npredictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We\nfurther show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot\nend-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting\nrobust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints."}

Consequently,\nthe optimal coupling is often singular with respect to Lebesgue measure.\nRegularizing the optimal transport problem with an entropy term yields an\napproximation called entropic optimal transport. Entropic penalties steer the\ninduced coupling toward a reference measure with desired properties. For\ninstance, when seeking a diffuse coupling, the most popular reference measures\nare the Lebesgue measure and the product of the two input measures. In this\nwork, we study the case where the reference coupling is not necessarily assumed\nto be a product. We focus on the Gaussian case as a motivating paradigm, and\nprovide a reduction of this more general optimal transport criterion to a\nmatrix optimization problem. This reduction enables us to provide a complete\ndescription of the solution, both in terms of the primal variable and the dual\nvariables. We argue that flexibility in terms of the reference measure can be\nimportant in statistical contexts, for instance when one has prior information,\nwhen there is uncertainty regarding the measures to be coupled, or to reduce\nbias when the entropic problem is used to estimate the un-regularized transport\nproblem.

However, these\nframeworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent\ndistributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose\na Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,\ntackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific\nrouting. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas\nvision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates\ndistinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert\nactivation for vision tail tokens.

This article is a significantly extended version of a paper\n  presented by the authors at IJCAI-2022", "summary": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze\nthe computational complexity."}

Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly\nscores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment\nanomalies.

In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel\nmulti-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these\nlimitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO\ncombines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level\nsegmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture.

We demonstrate the\nsuccessful application of this technique for the storage and sequential\nretrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high\ndimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between\neven sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has\napplications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient\nlong-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal\nbias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our\nmodel offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in\nlong-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language\nprocessing, forecasting, and beyond."}

Moreover, through detailed\nablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce\ntrainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that\narchitectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our\nexperiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation\ntechniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI\napplications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that\nperformance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network\ncomponents simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for\ndomain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current\narchitectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of\nfoundation models in brainwave analysis."}

Through a series of controlled experiments,\nwe analyze how parameters such as the ability to communicate, choice of model,\nand presence of environmental pressures affect the stability and emergence of\nseller collusion.

LCS programs herald a\ngenerational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related\nearly-stage lung disease.

Relative to models trained\nfrom scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,\nthereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label\nefficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of\nfine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000\nthoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public\ndatasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease\nclassification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,\nwhile generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a\nmasked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable\nsolution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive\nmodels by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest\ncomputational requirements.

We address these\nchallenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable\nand API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized\nbenchmarking framework.\n  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art\nspecialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;\nthis is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based\ntasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)\nWhile the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit\nless sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among\nnon-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)\nreasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a\npreliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest\nGPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial\nmisalignments."}

Traditional autoregressive image generation\nrelies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high\nlatency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by\nshifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved\nlimited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining\ngeneration quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized\nAutoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation\nordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query\ntokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility\namong concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)\nLocality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to\nminimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing\ngeneration quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256\nto 20 (256$\\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\\times$512 res.) without\ncompromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and\nachieving at least 3.4$\\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized\nautoregressive models."}

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT\nthrough extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile\nmanipulation tasks."}
