Abstract: Advances in generative artificial intelligence have altered multimedia
creation, allowing for automatic cinematic video synthesis from text inputs.
This work describes a method for creating 60-second cinematic movies
incorporating Stable Diffusion for high-fidelity image synthesis, GPT-2 for
narrative structuring, and a hybrid audio pipeline using gTTS and
YouTube-sourced music. It uses a five-scene framework, which is augmented by
linear frame interpolation, cinematic post-processing (e.g., sharpening), and
audio-video synchronization to provide professional-quality results. It was
created in a GPU-accelerated Google Colab environment using Python 3.11. It has
a dual-mode Gradio interface (Simple and Advanced), which supports resolutions
of up to 1024x768 and frame rates of 15-30 FPS. Optimizations such as CUDA
memory management and error handling ensure reliability. The experiments
demonstrate outstanding visual quality, narrative coherence, and efficiency,
furthering text-to-video synthesis for creative, educational, and industrial
applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

trajectories and their natural language task descriptions, such that test-time
adaptation improves progress estimation relying on semantic content over
temporal order. Our test-time adaptation method generalizes from a single
training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and
embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art in-context learning approach
using autoregressive vision-language models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

Motivation: To enhance discriminator performance in data-scarce scenarios, leveraging diffusion model properties.

Method: ScoreMix mixes scores from different class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling to create synthetic samples.

Result: Significant improvement in discriminative capabilities across benchmarks by generating challenging synthetic data.

Conclusion: ScoreMix offers practical benefits for training discriminators without extensive tuning, mitigating large dataset issues.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%

timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay

introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of generating structured SOAP notes for skin carcinoma patients using a weakly supervised multimodal framework, reducing clinician burden and reliance on manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin carcinoma is the most common cancer, with high healthcare costs. Manual SOAP note generation is time-consuming and causes burnout, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: A weakly supervised multimodal framework that uses lesion images and sparse clinical text to generate structured SOAP notes, minimizing the need for extensive manual annotations.

Result: The method performs as well as GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro in clinical relevance metrics, and introduces two new metrics: MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS).

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable, clinically accurate way to generate SOAP notes, reducing workload for clinicians and the demand for large annotated datasets.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could

Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical
images.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six

textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing accurate techniques to determine honey's botanical origin is essential for protecting consumer interests and ensuring market value differentiation, but it's impractical to collect all honey varieties for training models.

Method: The study compares various CIL algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral dataset and introduces a novel approach integrating CIL with continual backpropagation (CB) to mitigate loss-of-plasticity in neural networks.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the CB technique improved the performance of most CIL methods by 1-7%.

Conclusion: The proposed CB integration with CIL shows promise in enhancing botanical origin differentiation of honey, supporting consumer protection and market integrity.

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be

CR-CLIP can work with Symmetric Multi-Similarity Loss to achieve more accurate
semantic alignment and optimization using the refined features. Without using
ensemble learning, the CR-CLIP model achieves 66.78mAP and 82.08nDCG on the

occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured

Motivation: Existing metrics fail to detect demographic bias in high-performance face recognition systems, particularly in subtle differences in the tails of score distributions.

Method: CEI analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, focusing on tail probabilities and overall distribution shapes. CEI^A is an automated variant of CEI.

Result: Experiments show CEI effectively detects nuanced biases that previous methods missed, and CEI^A improves objectivity and practical application.

Conclusion: CEI is a robust tool for assessing fairness in face recognition, applicable beyond face biometrics to any distribution tail analysis problem.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation

dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced

undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are

characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template

We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Conclusion: Training in-context image editing models directly from videos is feasible and effective, offering promising performance across various tasks without relying on task-specific pipelines or expert models.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence

depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the

AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world

following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the difference between causation and correlation in AD research to improve diagnosis, treatment, and identify true disease drivers.

Method: The method involves using correlation analysis, XGBoost for classification, and SHAP values for interpretability to analyze features related to AD.

Result: The results show that strong correlations don't imply causation, and key features like cognitive scores and genetic risk factors are important for AD classification.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that integrating feature importance with statistical analysis provides a foundation for future causal studies, which could lead to better early diagnosis and targeted treatments for AD.

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have

generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,

challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous

these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a

visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial

long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI

with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to

integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured

dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,

benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Motivation: To combine answer set programming with SMT solvers for more efficient computation of stable models, especially handling real numbers in continuous changes.

Method: Developing the aspsmt2smt compiler that uses gringo for partial grounding and z3 for solving SMT instances derived from ASPMT programs.

Result: The system effectively handles real number computations, allowing for reasoning about continuous changes through SMT solvers.

Conclusion: The compiler provides a practical approach to leveraging SMT solvers for ASPMT, enhancing the ability to manage continuous domains.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

Method: The method involves a comprehensive review of existing automatic evaluation methods and the development of a unified taxonomy that organizes these methods across text, visual, and audio domains.

Result: The result is a unified taxonomy that identifies five fundamental paradigms for evaluating generated content in text, image, and audio modalities, showing the framework's broad applicability.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that this taxonomy offers a structured approach to evaluate generative AI outputs, highlighting the need for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI

that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our

Motivation: Existing instruction data lacks tool interaction, and human-annotated agentic benchmarks are too costly.

Conclusion: TaskCraft provides a large synthetic dataset for future research on agent tuning and evaluation.

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool

advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool

limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated

tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic

research on agent tuning and evaluation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how LLMs react to prompts that have the same meaning but different wordings, finding that they can give different answers, which might be due to how they process words and choose responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why LLMs sometimes give different answers to the same question when it's worded differently, which affects their reliability.

Method: The method is a framework called PBSS to check how LLMs change their answers when prompts are rephrased but keep the same meaning.

Result: The result shows that LLMs often change their answers in a predictable way when prompts are rephrased, linked to how they split words (tokenization) and choose responses (decoding).

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the way LLMs split words and choose responses can make their answers inconsistent, which is important for evaluating their stability and reliability.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed

novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of adapting text-based large language models to speech modality due to limited speech-to-speech data.

Method: The method involves using interleaved speech--text units during training, gradually reducing the text ratio to transition from text to speech modality.

Result: Experimental results on the CVSS dataset show that the proposed method consistently improves translation performance, particularly for languages with limited training data.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that scheduled interleaved speech--text training effectively facilitates modality adaptation and enhances S2ST performance, especially in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that using program execution traces to generate CoT supervision is a scalable and effective method for improving LLMs' reasoning capabilities. It provides a reliable alternative to human annotations and LLM-generated CoT, with benefits in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Motivation: To understand how news media framing affects public opinion during conflicts and to identify war and peace journalism indicators in a corpus of articles.

Method: Computational approaches combining frame semantics and large language models to analyze communicative and linguistic framing in news articles.

Result: Higher focus on war-based reporting compared to peace-based, with significant differences in framing between US, UK, and Middle Eastern outlets.

Conclusion: Media framing in conflict reporting can exacerbate tensions, highlighting the need for more balanced coverage and awareness of regional biases.

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper argues that predicting final labels for scientific claim verification from tables is insufficient, and instead proposes an explanation task focusing on identifying critical table cells. They create a new dataset with human-annotated cell-level rationales and develop a taxonomy for ambiguous cases. Experiments show that incorporating table alignment improves performance, but LLMs often don't align with human rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance interpretability and understanding of model reasoning in scientific claim verification tasks by moving beyond just predicting labels.

Method: The method involves creating a dataset by extending SciTab with human-annotated cell-level rationales and developing a taxonomy for ambiguous cases.

Result: The results show that using table alignment information improves verification performance, but LLMs struggle to recover human-aligned rationales despite accurate labels.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that current LLMs may not be reasoning faithfully about table content, highlighting the need for better alignment between model outputs and human interpretations.

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for reconstructing protoforms rely on probabilistic phonological edit models, which are data-driven and have limitations. There is a need for an approach that incorporates linguistic constraints.

Method: The authors propose an evolutionary optimization framework that integrates data-driven inference with rule-based heuristics, combining statistical patterns and linguistically motivated constraints.

Result: The method achieved significant improvements over baselines in character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility when tested on Latin protoforms from Romance language cognates.

Conclusion: By merging statistical and rule-based approaches within an evolutionary framework, the method provides a more effective protoform reconstruction, enhancing both accuracy and phonological plausibility.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a

an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model

constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how large language models (LLMs) handle character-level tasks, like spelling, and finds that they don't use straightforward methods. Instead, they rely on deeper layers of their Transformer architecture to reconstruct character information, which they don't fully encode in the embedding layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how LLMs internally represent and use character-level information during tasks like spelling, as they struggle with more complex character-level tasks despite being good at simple ones.

Method: The method involves analyzing the internal representations of LLMs through probing classifiers, identifying knowledge neurons, and inspecting attention weights to validate the mechanism of how they reconstruct character-level knowledge.

Result: The results show that the embedding layer doesn't fully encode character-level information, especially beyond the first character, leading LLMs to use intermediate and higher Transformer layers for reconstruction, which leads to a distinct 'breakthrough' in their spelling behavior.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that LLMs do not handle character-level tasks in a simple or direct way, but instead use complex internal mechanisms involving deeper layers of their architecture to reconstruct necessary information for tasks like spelling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance Open English Wordnet by filling in missing hypernymy links, particularly for adjectives, which have different characteristics compared to nouns and verbs.

Method: The paper discusses the theoretical aspects of hypernymy for adjectives, develops a new resource for adjective hypernymy, and fine-tunes large language models using the TaxoLLaMa methodology.

Result: The results demonstrate that TaxoLLaMa can be effectively adapted to predict hypernymy relations for adjectives, improving the resource's completeness.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that establishing hypernymy for adjectives is feasible through the proposed methods, contributing to more comprehensive linguistic linked open data.

Abstract: Open English Wordnet is a key resource published in OntoLex-lemon as part of
the linguistic linked open data cloud. There are, however, many links missing
in the resource, and in this paper, we look at how we can establish hypernymy
between adjectives. We present a theoretical discussion of the hypernymy
relation and how it differs for adjectives in contrast to nouns and verbs. We
develop a new resource for adjective hypernymy and fine-tune large language
models to predict adjective hypernymy, showing that the methodology of
TaxoLLaMa can be adapted to this task.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing

traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised

state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data

Abstract: This paper presents mRAG, a multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
framework composed of specialized agents for subtasks such as planning,
searching, reasoning, and coordination. Our system uses a self-training
paradigm with reward-guided trajectory sampling to optimize inter-agent
collaboration and enhance response generation. Evaluated on DataMorgana-derived
datasets during the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG competition, mRAG outperforms
conventional RAG baselines. We further analyze competition outcomes and
showcase the framework's strengths with case studies, demonstrating its
efficacy for complex, real-world RAG tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

TL;DR: MedRef is a new medical dialogue system that improves response accuracy by refining medical knowledge and adjusting prompts dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical dialogue systems have issues with identifying relevant medical knowledge and generating personalized, accurate responses.

Method: MedRef uses a knowledge refining mechanism to filter irrelevant data and a comprehensive prompt structure with historical and evident details. It includes Triplet Filter and Demo Selector modules for real-time adaptability.

Result: Experiments on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks show MedRef outperforms existing systems in generation quality and medical entity accuracy.

Conclusion: MedRef is effective and reliable for real-world healthcare applications, addressing key challenges in medical dialogue systems.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

Motivation: To develop a reasoning model for LLMs using a ground-up approach without relying on prior models or RL traces.

Method: Created a scalable RL pipeline from scratch, used RL training on text data, and introduced a method to enforce reasoning language in the model.

Result: Magistral Medium trained with RL alone showed maintained or improved multimodal understanding, instruction following, and function calling. Magistral Small includes cold-start data from Magistral Medium.

Conclusion: RL training on text data alone is effective for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities without losing initial checkpoint's features.

Abstract: We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable

demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal

Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we
open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any

designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of comprehensive Chinese datasets for harmful content detection, which are currently scarce and limited in scope compared to English resources.

Method: The method involves creating a benchmark with real-world data across six categories and developing a knowledge rule base through professional annotation. Additionally, a knowledge-augmented baseline is proposed by integrating human-annotated rules and LLMs' implicit knowledge.

Result: The result is a benchmark dataset for Chinese harmful content detection and a baseline model that allows smaller models to perform as well as state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed benchmark and knowledge-augmented approach provide valuable resources and methods for enhancing Chinese harmful content detection, particularly for resource-constrained models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing

automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We revisit the problem of mean estimation on $\ell_p$ balls under additive
Gaussian noise. When $p$ is strictly less than $2$, it is well understood that
rate-optimal estimators must be nonlinear in the observations. In this work, we
study the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which may be viewed as a
nonlinear shrinkage procedure for mean estimation over $\ell_p$ balls. We
demonstrate two phenomena for the behavior of the MLE, which depend on the
noise level, the radius of the norm constraint, the dimension, and the norm
index $p$. First, as a function of the dimension, for $p$ near $1$ or at least
$2$, the MLE is minimax rate-optimal for all noise levels and all constraint
radii. On the other hand, for $p$ between $1$ and $2$, there is a more striking
behavior: for essentially all noise levels and radii for which nonlinear
estimates are required, the MLE is minimax rate-suboptimal, despite being
nonlinear in the observations. Our results also imply similar conclusions when
given $n$ independent and identically distributed Gaussian samples, where we
demonstrate that the MLE can be suboptimal by a polynomial factor in the sample
size. Our lower bounds are constructive: whenever the MLE is rate-suboptimal,
we provide explicit instances on which the MLE provably incurs suboptimal risk.

Motivation: SNR is crucial in statistical models, especially for heritability estimation in genomics. Current methods are limited to single-response settings, so extending them to multivariate cases is needed.

estimating SNR, primarily explored in single-response settings. In this study,
we extend the method-of-moments SNR estimation framework to encompass both
fixed effects and random effects linear models with multivariate responses. In
particular, we establish and compare the asymptotic distributions of the
proposed estimators. Furthermore, we extend our approach to accommodate cases
with residual heteroskedasticity and derive asymptotic inference procedures
based on standard error estimation. The effectiveness of our methods is
demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the properties of the score confidence set for the local average
treatment effect in non and semiparametric instrumental variable models. This
confidence set is constructed by inverting a score test based on an estimate of
the nonparametric influence function for the estimand, and is known to be
uniformly valid in models that allow for arbitrarily weak instruments; because
of this, the confidence set can have infinite diameter at some laws. We
characterize the six possible forms the score confidence set can take: a finite
interval, an infinite interval (or a union of them), the whole real line, an
empty set, or a single point. Moreover, we show that, at any fixed law, the
score confidence set asymptotically coincides, up to a term of order 1/n, with
the Wald confidence interval based on the doubly robust estimator which solves
the estimating equation associated with the nonparametric influence function.
This result implies that, in models where the efficient influence function
coincides with the nonparametric influence function, the score confidence set
is, in a sense, optimal in terms of its diameter. We also show that under weak
instrument asymptotics, where the strength of the instrument is modelled as
local to zero, the doubly robust estimator is asymptotically biased and does
not follow a normal distribution. A simulation study confirms that, as
expected, the doubly robust estimator performs poorly when instruments are
weak, whereas the score confidence set retains good finite-sample properties in
both strong and weak instrument settings. Finally, we provide an algorithm to
compute the score confidence set, which is now available in the DoubleML
package for double machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a convolutional product that doesn't require padding, thus avoiding the introduction of junk information, which is a limitation in conventional methods.

Method: The method involves proposing a domain-based CP and combining it with STP of vectors to create a new CP, which is then used to develop an STP-based CNN.

Result: The result is an STP-based CNN that effectively handles image and third-order signal identification without the need for padding.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that the new CP method combining domain-based CP and STP of vectors is effective for tasks like image and third-order signal identification, offering an improvement over traditional CNNs by eliminating padding issues.

Abstract: The semi-tensor product (STP) of vectors is a generalization of conventional
inner product of vectors, which allows the factor vectors to of different
dimensions. This paper proposes a domain-based convolutional product (CP).
Combining domain-based CP with STP of vectors, a new CP is proposed. Since
there is no zero or any other padding, it can avoid the junk information caused
by padding. Using it, the STP-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is
developed. Its application to image and third order signal identifications is
considered.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

Abstract: Cardiac substructures are essential in thoracic radiation therapy planning to
minimize risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning (DL) offers
efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but lacks generalizability across
different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and
validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for comprehensive and
multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through
replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped
backbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac
substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries
(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,
and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used
to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison
models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently
trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against
reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were
0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC
outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical
differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that
is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping
structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by
simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled
flexibility for clinical settings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless

ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its

propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Conclusion: The paper bridges the gap in keyphrase generation research by analyzing existing work and addressing evaluation issues and model availability.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand how AI can effectively enhance human creativity by clarifying the mechanisms of such enhancement.

Method: The paper uses the perspective of distributed creativity to identify and analyze three modes of AI contribution to creative processes.

Result: The study identifies three modes (Support, Synergy, Symbiosis) and examines their influence on various levels of creativity, discussing theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that AI can enhance human creativity through these three modes, emphasizing the importance of technical autonomy and perceived agency in achieving effective creativity enhancement.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human

distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies

applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of

including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

### [209] [Disclosure Audits for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10171)
*Saswat Das,Jameson Sandler,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Conversational Manipulation for Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, an iterative probing strategy to audit privacy risks in large language model agents by simulating realistic multi-turn interactions, revealing vulnerabilities that single-turn defenses miss. It also proposes an auditing procedure with quantifiable risk metrics and an open benchmark for evaluating conversational privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Model agents are increasingly used in sensitive applications but face privacy risks due to continuous access to personal data. Current single-turn defenses are insufficient, so there's a need for a comprehensive auditing framework to identify latent vulnerabilities.

Method: The CMPL framework is an iterative probing strategy that simulates multi-turn interactions to stress-test agents with strict privacy directives. It includes an auditing procedure based on quantifiable risk metrics and an open benchmark for evaluating conversational privacy across different agent implementations.

Result: The evaluation across diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations showed that CMPL effectively identifies privacy risks not detected by existing single-turn defenses, highlighting its ability to uncover latent vulnerabilities in LLM agents.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that CMPL serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for auditing conversational privacy, emphasizing the importance of multi-turn interaction testing. It also presents a benchmark for evaluating privacy across agent implementations, suggesting that current defenses may be inadequate against more complex attack scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

TL;DR: This paper reveals that some machine unlearning methods can be bypassed by simple prompt attacks, emphasizing the need for better evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the effectiveness of machine unlearning methods against prompt attacks and identify vulnerabilities.

Method: The method involves systematically evaluating eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis.

Result: Results show that RMU and TAR are robust, while ELM is vulnerable, with specific prompts recovering up to 57.3% accuracy. Logit analysis indicates unlearned models don't hide knowledge via formatting changes.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that current unlearning methods may not truly remove knowledge, urging better evaluation frameworks to ensure effective unlearning.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely

involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to relax the recovery criterion in group testing to allow approximate results, which can be more efficient and practical in scenarios where exact identification is not critical.

Method: The paper analyzes existing algorithms and provides theoretical bounds for one-sided approximate recovery, focusing on cases where only false negatives or false positives are allowed.

Result: The results show that an algorithm can achieve the optimal threshold for one-sided approximate recovery when allowing false negatives, and that the better of two existing algorithms is optimal when allowing false positives.

Conclusion: The study concludes that approximate recovery in group testing can be effectively achieved with specific algorithms, and highlights the optimality of certain methods under different misclassification constraints.

Abstract: The group testing problem consists of determining a sparse subset of
defective items from within a larger set of items via a series of tests, where
each test outcome indicates whether at least one defective item is included in
the test. We study the approximate recovery setting, where the recovery
criterion of the defective set is relaxed to allow a small number of items to
be misclassified. In particular, we consider one-sided approximate recovery
criteria, where we allow either only false negative or only false positive
misclassifications. Under false negatives only (i.e., finding a subset of
defectives), we show that there exists an algorithm matching the optimal
threshold of two-sided approximate recovery. Under false positives only (i.e.,
finding a superset of the defectives), we provide a converse bound showing that
the better of two existing algorithms is optimal.

into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve lane-topology prediction for autonomous navigation by incorporating structured road metadata and lane-width priors into the SMERF model, showing better performance in complex intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lane-topology prediction is essential for safe autonomous navigation, and existing methods may lack sufficient understanding of the road environment due to missing structured information.

Method: The authors augment the SMERF model with structured road metadata from OSM maps and lane-width priors from road design manuals, combined with road centerline encodings.

Result: The method improves lane and traffic element detection and their association in two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios, with results evaluated using four topology-aware metrics.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates good generalization and scalability to diverse road topologies and conditions.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

Abstract: Constructing a physically realistic and accurately scaled simulated 3D world
is crucial for the training and evaluation of embodied intelligence tasks. The
diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets
are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI.
However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on
traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which
suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations
significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present
EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It
enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and
photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale
in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can
be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained
physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation.
EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key
modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object
Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates
diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging
generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the
needs of embodied intelligence related research. Code is available at

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to achieve more precise control over music generation by allowing interventions during inference, which can transfer timbre, style, and fuse genres effectively.

Method: The method involves steering the residual stream and attention layer activations using linear probes trained on them, framed as a regression task to preserve directional information in activation space.

Result: The results show improved performance by modelling interventions as a regression task, combined with text prompt conditioning for global and local control in music generation.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that the approach offers effective global and local control over music generation, with audio samples demonstrating its capabilities.

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

TL;DR: The paper discusses strategy-proof mechanisms for facility location that aim to maximize equitability using the Gini index, but shows that no such mechanism can guarantee a bounded approximation ratio for the optimal Gini index. Instead, it proposes using the complemented Gini index and evaluates the performance of deterministic and randomized mechanisms. It also examines approximation of Nash welfare as an equitable measure.


<details>

Motivation: The motivation is to find strategy-proof mechanisms for facility location that can achieve equitable outcomes, as measured by the Gini index, while addressing the limitations of existing approaches.

Method: The paper presents a theoretical analysis, including a proof of an impossibility result regarding the approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index. It then proposes using the complemented Gini index and evaluates deterministic and randomized mechanisms for their approximation performance. Additionally, it considers the approximation of Nash welfare.

Result: The main result is an impossibility theorem showing that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index. The paper also provides analysis on how well mechanisms can approximate the complemented Gini index and Nash welfare.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that while achieving bounded approximation for the optimal Gini index is impossible with strategy-proof mechanisms, alternative measures like the complemented Gini index and Nash welfare offer feasible approaches for approximating equitable outcomes in facility location problems.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

TL;DR: Edit360 is a new framework that allows editing 3D assets from any angle without needing to adjust the model, using video diffusion models and a special method to keep everything looking consistent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve 3D asset editing by making it more flexible and practical, as current methods are limited to fixed viewpoints.

Method: Edit360 uses video diffusion models and an Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism to align and merge multi-view data in latent and attention spaces.

Result: The framework can edit 3D assets from any viewpoint while maintaining consistency across all views, leading to high-quality 3D reconstructions.

Conclusion: Edit360 enables more customizable and practical 3D content creation by overcoming the limitations of previous methods in multi-view consistency.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

Conclusion: The study suggests that scale-aware model training could be a promising area for future research.

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions
visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection),
is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains
challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation
in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient
consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and
directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency
Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a
frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we
develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images
into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and
high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional
edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an
Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical
high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To
effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency
Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and
slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain
improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental
analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that
HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48\% (ranging from 2.39\%
to 7.72\%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an
average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the
segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable
computational efficiency and clinical applicability. Code:

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges
affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical
LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific
accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text
encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with
large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language
model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel
dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net
with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through
cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep
embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM
training framework. In combination, these strategies enable
pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis
given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance
and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a
size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent
foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer
prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training
dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier
solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to
training on real images alone.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain
MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily
available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases.
Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using
diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for
training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large
disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal
data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this
assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or
accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In
this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for
anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly
supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images
into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.
To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly
randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary
dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and
anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,
using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS
dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms
variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion;
and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting
methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been

Abstract: Medical images are usually collected from multiple domains, leading to domain
shifts that impair the performance of medical image segmentation models. Domain
Generalization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with
strong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG
methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following
limitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their
exclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse
effects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we
propose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style
augmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation.
Specifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data,
allowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data
domains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative

Abstract: Following the successful paradigm shift of large language models, leveraging
pre-training on a massive corpus of data and fine-tuning on different
downstream tasks, generalist models have made their foray into computer vision.
The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on
segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of
architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a
comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image
segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts
underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different
declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on
the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and
others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their
performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature,
followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific
models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with
regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy
artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we share our perspective on future
directions concerning synthetic data, early fusion, lessons learnt from
generalist models in natural language processing, agentic AI and physical AI,
and clinical translation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and key technology in
computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. Previous methods can be broadly
classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,
Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of
them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or
the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.
Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a
promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range
modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have
also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive
performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the
Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring
the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical
image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure
RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates
ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical
image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first
pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a
large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets
demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation
performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from
scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder
in enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology,
where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been
shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current
practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of
these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis.
Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting
artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage
deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and
scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in
digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation.
  We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by
analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types
or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a
map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to
specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and
effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.
  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images
were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed
software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple
models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet
was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a
limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together
(chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid
design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as
well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new audio comprehension model that uses dialogue continuation from LLMs to improve instruction-following without needing multitask tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the caption variation problem in audio comprehension models by leveraging the dialogue continuation ability of LLMs to capture deeper meaning beyond surface-level words.

Method: The method involves training the model to generate responses as if the input caption initiated a dialogue, rather than directly generating captions. This approach uses LLMs' dialogue continuation skills to better capture the caption's meaning.

Result: The model achieves zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction tuning, even when trained only on audio captioning datasets. It performs well on AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench tests.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that dialogue continuation training effectively mitigates caption variation issues and enables the model to follow various unseen instructions, showing promise for audio comprehension tasks.

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that RT-VC effectively provides real-time voice conversion with reduced latency and high-quality results by leveraging articulatory features and DDSP.

Abstract: Voice conversion has emerged as a pivotal technology in numerous applications

present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers
ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an
articulatory feature space to naturally disentangle content and speaker
characteristics, facilitating more robust and interpretable voice

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel loss function and speaker code for robust speech recognition adaptation with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech recognisers need adaptation for new environments, but there's often too little unlabelled data for fine-tuning.

Method: Uses a conditional entropy loss over multiple hypotheses and a short speaker code for adaptation.

Result: 20% relative improvement in word error rate with one minute of data, 29% with ten minutes on noise-augmented Common Voice.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances robustness in speech recognition adaptation with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Motivation: To understand how a convolutional RNN trained with model-free reinforcement learning solves Sokoban levels, particularly by leveraging test-time computation.

Method: Partial reverse-engineering of the RNN, analyzing its internal mechanisms and activations to identify components similar to classic bidirectional search algorithms.

Result: The RNN uses state-action activations as a value function, with specialized kernels extending these activations forward and backward to form paths, allowing for increased search depth through layer-specific plan representations.

Conclusion: The mechanisms in the RNN, though initially seeming opaque, can be interpreted using familiar concepts from bidirectional search, showing that model-free training can lead to understandable computational strategies.

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to relax equivariance constraints in 3D molecule generation diffusion models by learning sample-dependent SO(3) transformations, achieving better performance and efficiency than non-equivariant models while matching the sample quality of state-of-the-art equivariant ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of specialized equivariant architectures in diffusion models for 3D molecule generation, which hinder scalability and efficiency.

Method: The method involves learning a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation for each molecule to create an aligned latent space, followed by training a non-equivariant diffusion model on these aligned representations.

Result: The approach shows significant improvement over previous non-equivariant models, achieving sample quality on par with state-of-the-art equivariant models, along with better training and sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that relaxing equivariance constraints through sample-dependent SO(3) transformations leads to more scalable and efficient diffusion models for 3D molecule generation without sacrificing sample quality.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malicious sockpuppet detection is crucial for maintaining reliable information and preventing disinformation on Wikipedia. Prior methods using stylistic and metadata features lack adaptability to author-specific behaviors, especially with limited text data.

Method: The paper applies meta-learning, a technique that trains models across multiple tasks to improve performance in data-scarce settings, enabling rapid adaptation to new sockpuppet-group writing styles.

Result: Meta-learning significantly improves prediction precision compared to pre-trained models, advancing the fight against sockpuppetry on open editing platforms.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that meta-learning is effective for detecting sockpuppets with limited data, and the released dataset encourages further research in sockpuppetry and meta-learning.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate

sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can

ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models can self-correct but are usually outperformed by other models. The goal is to bridge this performance gap.

Method: Duo uses curriculum learning guided by Gaussian processes to speed up training and Discrete Consistency Distillation to adapt consistency distillation to discrete settings, improving sampling.

Result: Models with curriculum learning outperform autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3/7 benchmarks. Discrete Consistency Distillation allows for two orders of magnitude faster sampling.

Conclusion: Duo effectively enhances uniform-state discrete diffusion models, making them competitive with autoregressive and masked diffusion models through Gaussian diffusion insights and efficient training/sampling techniques.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal

systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web

interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional

This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving

interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the

is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at
https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.
