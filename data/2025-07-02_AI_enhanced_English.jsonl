In many real-world settings, the covariates in the target\ndomain lie near a low-dimensional manifold within the support of the source,\ne.g., personalized handwritten digits (target) within a large, high-dimensional\nimage repository (source). Since density ratios may not exist in these\nsettings, standard transfer learning techniques often fail to leverage such\nstructure. This necessitates the development of methods that exploit both the\nsize of the source dataset and the structured nature of the target.\n  Motivated by this, we establish new minimax rates under covariate shift for\nestimating a regression function in a general H\\\"older class, assuming the\ntarget distribution lies near -- but not exactly on -- a smooth submanifold of\nthe source. General smoothness helps reduce the curse of dimensionality when\nthe target function is highly regular, while approximate manifolds capture\nrealistic, noisy data. We identify a phase transition in the minimax rate of\nestimation governed by the distance to the manifold, source and target sample\nsizes, function smoothness, and intrinsic versus ambient dimensions. We propose\na local polynomial regression estimator that achieves optimal rates on either\nside of the phase transition boundary. Additionally, we construct a fully\nadaptive procedure that adjusts to unknown smoothness and intrinsic dimension,\nand attains nearly optimal rates.

This is a\npressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect\nreciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.\nHere, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide\n21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate\n-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these\ninteractions should be judged.
