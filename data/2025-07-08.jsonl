To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network\ndesigned to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.\nLeveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts\ntime-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.\nThis integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate\nmodules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)\nconversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error\npropagation.

To assess\nToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a\nnovel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in\nreaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present\nTomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting\nand responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of\nTomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,\nfew-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,\nchain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and\ninformation about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized\nboth variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,\nGPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,\nwe conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided\nparticipants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed\nintent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM\ncapabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with\nFs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance\ncomparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for\nhuman-AI collaboration."}

To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos.

The agents are implemented as\nzero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the\nmodel now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)\ndecides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)\ndetermines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers\nthe resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without\nthe use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents\nwith transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An\nimprovement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies\nin the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional\nLLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,\nthe benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient\ncontext.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions.

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further\nimprove over vanilla self consistency.

In\ncontrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after\ngeneration are often inefficient because they operate externally without\nupdating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic\ndesign capabilities.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven\nreinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that\nachieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1\nemploys a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on\nsyntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from\nsynthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn\ncomplex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code\nthat is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on\nstandard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results\nin functional correctness.

This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,\ndesigned to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed\nto the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve\nenergy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing\nenergy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed\nsystem was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying\ntheft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power\nconsumption reduction exceeding 64\\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy\nand consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more\nenergy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart\ngrids.

Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images.

The\nsimple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small\nadjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range\nof different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned\nprompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The\nmodifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from\nsimple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if\nany, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies\nexisting solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based\nstructures effortlessly."}

To effectively realize such domain\ngeneralization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose\ndeep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection\non various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly\nfocusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial\nto achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For\nsome domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis\nrelying on cross-modal fusion is necessary.

Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained\ndiffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,\nthese methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising\nprocess. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),\na strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing\nfrom an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising\nsteps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce\ninconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts\nthe weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate\npotential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ\nacross multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring,\nand compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods\ncan effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original\nperformance."}

Rather than\nmodifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --\nrepresented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to\ngenerate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as\nit ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as\ninstances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from\nthis concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain\nthe original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby\nmisleading the classifier.

This scarcity hinders generalization to\nreal-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune\nfoundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.\nHowever, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on\npost-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in\nmodern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error\naccumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,\nwe introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual\nknowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate\ncomplete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution\nof UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence\ngeneration problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of\nmulti-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the\nconsistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.\nTo further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a\ndecoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide\ncross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine\ntexture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these\ncomponents allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize\nhigh-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive\nexperiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\nimage-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with\nsuperior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world\ngeneralization."}

Due to these concerns,\nthis work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the\nprivacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework\nthat uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,\nsuch as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the\nproposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its\nimpact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and\nsensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes.

Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms\ntraditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.\nFor instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on\nSTEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA\nbaselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using\nReinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly\nenhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%\nto 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,\nscaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation\nand performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.\nThe impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties\nsuggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong\nreward models."}

This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit\n(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,\nenabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,\nrecurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it\nideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark\ndemonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex\nbaselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF\ncreates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive\nfusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for\npowerful, scalable multimodal representation learning."}

To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP).

To\naddress this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract\ntemporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.\nSpecifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture\nthe local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism\nwith hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction\ndependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion\nstate attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine\nthe trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module\nthat leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates\nthe refined trajectories with fewer model parameters.

To\novercome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning\nframework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated\nCBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:\n(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has\nachieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a\nnovel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture\ncritical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments\nconducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that\nGeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the\nleading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm\nthreshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available\nat: https://github.com/xmed-lab/GeoSapiens."}

In the brain, neuromodulators such as\nacetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain\nand inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed\nby dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal\nsystem, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant\nsubstrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals\ncoincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a\nsingle somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts\nthe output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that\ntranslate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this\nmechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons\nand single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,\nlinked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).\nThe soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,\nwhile dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by\nshifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive\nor tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of\ncalcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition\nsuppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold\nof neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting\naccelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and\nflexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators\ncould serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively\nmodulating the synaptic weight updates."}

This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs\nwith a similar capacity for internal processing.\n  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.'\nOur findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing\nthe model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins\npredicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant\nperformance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a\n`reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes\nthe input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation\nmodel. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that\nthey can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more\nhuman-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques\ncan provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy\nboost."}

This work proposes a novel\nautoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above\nchallenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information\nin DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task\ninto a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps\nwith extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step.\nAdditionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional\nprobability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image\nfeatures for autoregression without relearning contextual information from\npatch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive\nprocess and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation\nmodels. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly\navailable color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and\nsuperior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression\nmethods.

Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the\nfirst general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To\nsupport this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI,\ncarefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's\nperformance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and\nvarious aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive\nexperiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly\nwell-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task."}

In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token\nand other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden\nstates, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes.

To close this gap, we here introduce a\nsolution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than\nscaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early\ninfancy into adulthood.

Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images.

While\nfeature selection methods have been extensively studied, they are typically\nlimited to selecting individual features.

Researchers must (1)\nexplicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements,\n(2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric\ntesting, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4)\nexecute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate\nfor non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated\nboundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through\nan example of model evaluation--\"LLM selfhood\"--showing how systematic\nvalidation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement\nartifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent\npractices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical\nfoundation for AI psychology research."}

Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on\nvision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.\nThis study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both\ntraining and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate\nCVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily\nadapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label\nframework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a\nsignificant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose\nCVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,\nbinary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with\ntextual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.\nBy adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the\nEndoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the\nResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that\nCVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,\nboosts CVS recognition over image-only methods.

During the response phase of disasters, airports are important\nhubs where relief aid arrives and people need to be evacuated. However, the\nairport often forms a bottleneck in these relief operations due to the sudden\nneed for increased capacity. Limited research has been done on the operational\nside of airport disaster management. Experts identify the main problems as,\nfirst, the asymmetry of information between the airport and incoming flights,\nand second, the lack of resources. The goal of this research is to understand\nthe effects of incomplete knowledge of incoming flights with different resource\nallocation strategies on the performance of cargo handling operations at an\nairport after a natural disaster. An agent-based model is created, implementing\nrealistic offloading strategies with different degrees of information\nuncertainty. Model calibration and verification are performed with experts in\nthe field. The model performance is measured by the average turnaround time,\nwhich is divided into offloading time, boarding time, and cumulative waiting\ntimes.
