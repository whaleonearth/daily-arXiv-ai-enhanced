Prior\nstudies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn\nidentity features implicitly. This has led to conflicting views: some suppress\nidentity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence.\nTo reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity\nalone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity\nfeatures generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm\nthat identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations\npreserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm\ngeneralization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly\nsuppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively\ncontrolled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \\textbf{SELFI}\n(\\textbf{SEL}ective \\textbf{F}usion of \\textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable\ndetection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists\nof: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity\nembeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a\nforgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware\nFusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features\nusing a relevance-guided fusion mechanism.

Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we\nconclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks\nand improve the calibration of reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate.

In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an\naccurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned\nchallenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement\n(HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations\nand overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to\npairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving\nefficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement.\nSubsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD)\nparadigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information\nflow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing\ncorrelation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to\nleverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel\nconvolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce\nparameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We\nconduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM\nauthorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel\nmodel that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5\nencoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on\nclassification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a\ntwo-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a\nprobability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we\nintroduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs\ngenerated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our\nmodel to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer\nmodels, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3,\nLongformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model\nachieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely\nrelated models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class\nattribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku,\nGPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the\nCodeT5-Authorship architecture, the LLM-AuthorBench benchmark, and all relevant\nGoogle Colab scripts on GitHub: https://github.com/LLMauthorbench/.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific\ncode-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step\nin constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing\ncode benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are\nprone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could\nresult in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations\nof model capabilities.\n  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental\ndesigns and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt\nsensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that\nmodifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and\ntheir structure as much as possible.

Existing encoder decoder based methods\ntypically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption\nthat the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of\nlogical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a\nparticular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal\nsemantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.\nThanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these\nabnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.\nThis ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with\nmisleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel\nnormality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder\ndirectly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the\nreconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics\nof normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable\nsemantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of\nnormal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic\nfeatures are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the\nreconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality.

To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a\nSemantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines\nhigh-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced\nControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and\nsemantically grounded image synthesis.

We further\nevaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's\nTau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10\nyears of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows),\nDGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87).\nKendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means\nclustering revealed \"high-volatility growth\" and \"defensive blue-chip\" stocks,\nwith the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations.\nKendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors.
