Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the context of multi-object tracking using video synthetic aperture radar
(Video SAR), Doppler shifts induced by target motion result in artifacts that
are easily mistaken for shadows caused by static occlusions. Moreover,
appearance changes of the target caused by Doppler mismatch may lead to
association failures and disrupt trajectory continuity. A major limitation in
this field is the lack of public benchmark datasets for standardized algorithm
evaluation. To address the above challenges, we collected and annotated 45
video SAR sequences containing moving targets, and named the Video SAR MOT
Benchmark (VSMB). Specifically, to mitigate the effects of trailing and
defocusing in moving targets, we introduce a line feature enhancement mechanism
that emphasizes the positive role of motion shadows and reduces false alarms
induced by static occlusions. In addition, to mitigate the adverse effects of
target appearance variations, we propose a motion-aware clue discarding
mechanism that substantially improves tracking robustness in Video SAR. The
proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VSMB, and the
dataset and model are released at https://github.com/softwarePupil/VSMB.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide,
making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical
priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset
comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from
2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts,
all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were
rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal
integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical
metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR),
and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and
deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data,
progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets.
BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models,
including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial
training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed
the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast
phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT
model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2-
patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark
splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically
meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, yet
generating coherent image sequences for visual storytelling remains
challenging. A key challenge is effectively leveraging all previous text-image
pairs, referred to as history text-image pairs, which provide contextual
information for maintaining consistency across frames. Existing auto-regressive
methods condition on all past image-text pairs but require extensive training,
while training-free subject-specific approaches ensure consistency but lack
adaptability to narrative prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a
multi-modal history adapter for text-to-image diffusion models, \textbf{ViSTA}.
It consists of (1) a multi-modal history fusion module to extract relevant
history features and (2) a history adapter to condition the generation on the
extracted relevant features. We also introduce a salient history selection
strategy during inference, where the most salient history text-image pair is
selected, improving the quality of the conditioning. Furthermore, we propose to
employ a Visual Question Answering-based metric TIFA to assess text-image
alignment in visual storytelling, providing a more targeted and interpretable
assessment of generated images. Evaluated on the StorySalon and FlintStonesSV
dataset, our proposed ViSTA model is not only consistent across different
frames, but also well-aligned with the narrative text descriptions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate microscopic medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in
diagnosing various cancerous cells and identifying tumors. Driven by
advancements in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformer-based models have been extensively studied to enhance receptive
fields and improve medical image segmentation task. However, they often
struggle to capture complex cellular and tissue structures in challenging
scenarios such as background clutter and object overlap. Moreover, their
reliance on the availability of large datasets for improved performance, along
with the high computational cost, limit their practicality. To address these
issues, we propose an efficient framework for the segmentation task, named
InceptionMamba, which encodes multi-stage rich features and offers both
performance and computational efficiency. Specifically, we exploit semantic
cues to capture both low-frequency and high-frequency regions to enrich the
multi-stage features to handle the blurred region boundaries (e.g., cell
boundaries). These enriched features are input to a hybrid model that combines
an Inception depth-wise convolution with a Mamba block, to maintain high
efficiency and capture inherent variations in the scales and shapes of the
regions of interest. These enriched features along with low-resolution features
are fused to get the final segmentation mask. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two challenging microscopic segmentation
datasets (SegPC21 and GlaS) and two skin lesion segmentation datasets (ISIC2017
and ISIC2018), while reducing computational cost by about 5 times compared to
the previous best performing method.

*Ilya Ilyankou,Natchapon Jongwiriyanurak,Tao Cheng,James Haworth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a CLIP-based multi-modal, multi-label classifier for predicting geographical context tags from landscape photos in the Geograph dataset, achieving higher accuracy by combining image, location, and title embeddings. It provides a lightweight pipeline for training on a modest laptop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to predict geographical context tags from landscape photos, especially in data-sparse regions where traditional methods may not be effective.

Method: The method involves using CLIP's pre-trained image and text embeddings, combining them with location and title data, and adding a simple classification head to improve accuracy.

Result: The results show that combining location and title embeddings with image features leads to higher accuracy compared to using image embeddings alone.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed approach effectively supports downstream tasks like building location embedders for GeoAI applications, even in regions with limited data.

Abstract: We present a CLIP-based, multi-modal, multi-label classifier for predicting
geographical context tags from landscape photos in the Geograph dataset--a
crowdsourced image archive spanning the British Isles, including remote regions
lacking POIs and street-level imagery. Our approach addresses a Kaggle
competition\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-geographic-context-from-landscape-photos}
task based on a subset of Geograph's 8M images, with strict evaluation: exact
match accuracy is required across 49 possible tags. We show that combining
location and title embeddings with image features improves accuracy over using
image embeddings alone. We release a lightweight
pipeline\footnote{https://github.com/SpaceTimeLab/ClipTheLandscape} that trains
on a modest laptop, using pre-trained CLIP image and text embeddings and a
simple classification head. Predicted tags can support downstream tasks such as
building location embedders for GeoAI applications, enriching spatial
understanding in data-sparse regions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Scene understanding is critical for various downstream tasks in autonomous
driving, including facilitating driver-agent communication and enhancing
human-centered explainability of autonomous vehicle (AV) decisions. This paper
evaluates the capability of four multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
including relatively small models, to understand scenes in a zero-shot,
in-context learning setting. Additionally, we explore whether combining these
models using an ensemble approach with majority voting can enhance scene
understanding performance. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o, the largest
model, outperforms the others in scene understanding. However, the performance
gap between GPT-4o and the smaller models is relatively modest, suggesting that
advanced techniques such as improved in-context learning, retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), or fine-tuning could further optimize the smaller models'
performance. We also observe mixed results with the ensemble approach: while
some scene attributes show improvement in performance metrics such as F1-score,
others experience a decline. These findings highlight the need for more
sophisticated ensemble techniques to achieve consistent gains across all scene
attributes. This study underscores the potential of leveraging MLLMs for scene
understanding and provides insights into optimizing their performance for
autonomous driving applications.

*Boris Ivanovic,Cristiano Saltori,Yurong You,Yan Wang,Wenjie Luo,Marco Pavone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a triplane-based tokenization method for AVs, reducing tokens by 72% and improving inference speed by 50% compared to image patch methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive Transformers are used in AV policies but need efficient tokenization for real-time performance on embedded hardware.

Method: Triplane-based multi-camera tokenization using 3D neural reconstruction and rendering to create geometry-aware tokens.

Result: The approach reduces tokens by 72%, speeds up inference by 50%, maintains motion planning accuracy, and improves offroad rates in simulations.

Conclusion: The triplane method offers a more efficient and effective tokenization strategy for AVs, enhancing real-time performance without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Autoregressive Transformers are increasingly being deployed as end-to-end
robot and autonomous vehicle (AV) policy architectures, owing to their
scalability and potential to leverage internet-scale pretraining for
generalization. Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to
ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware.
To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization
strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and
rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input
cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry
around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art
neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over
current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer
tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same
open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop
driving simulations.

Abstract: While the rapid proliferation of wearable cameras has raised significant
concerns about egocentric video privacy, prior work has largely overlooked the
unique privacy threats posed to the camera wearer. This work investigates the
core question: How much privacy information about the camera wearer can be
inferred from their first-person view videos? We introduce EgoPrivacy, the
first large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of privacy risks
in egocentric vision. EgoPrivacy covers three types of privacy (demographic,
individual, and situational), defining seven tasks that aim to recover private
information ranging from fine-grained (e.g., wearer's identity) to
coarse-grained (e.g., age group). To further emphasize the privacy threats
inherent to egocentric vision, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Attack, a novel
attack strategy that leverages ego-to-exo retrieval from an external pool of
exocentric videos to boost the effectiveness of demographic privacy attacks. An
extensive comparison of the different attacks possible under all threat models
is presented, showing that private information of the wearer is highly
susceptible to leakage. For instance, our findings indicate that foundation
models can effectively compromise wearer privacy even in zero-shot settings by
recovering attributes such as identity, scene, gender, and race with 70-80%
accuracy. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: Accurate identification of individual plants from unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) images is essential for advancing high-throughput phenotyping and
supporting data-driven decision-making in plant breeding. This study presents
MatchPlant, a modular, graphical user interface-supported, open-source Python
pipeline for UAV-based single-plant detection and geospatial trait extraction.
MatchPlant enables end-to-end workflows by integrating UAV image processing,
user-guided annotation, Convolutional Neural Network model training for object
detection, forward projection of bounding boxes onto an orthomosaic, and
shapefile generation for spatial phenotypic analysis. In an early-season maize
case study, MatchPlant achieved reliable detection performance (validation AP:
89.6%, test AP: 85.9%) and effectively projected bounding boxes, covering 89.8%
of manually annotated boxes with 87.5% of projections achieving an Intersection
over Union (IoU) greater than 0.5. Trait values extracted from predicted
bounding instances showed high agreement with manual annotations (r =
0.87-0.97, IoU >= 0.4). Detection outputs were reused across time points to
extract plant height and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index with minimal
additional annotation, facilitating efficient temporal phenotyping. By
combining modular design, reproducibility, and geospatial precision, MatchPlant
offers a scalable framework for UAV-based plant-level analysis with broad
applicability in agricultural and environmental monitoring.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Paucity of medical data severely limits the generalizability of diagnostic ML
models, as the full spectrum of disease variability can not be represented by a
small clinical dataset. To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been
considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and
augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images,
deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for
synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when
data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for
incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand
labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities,
making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel
framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through
AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease
images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined
criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly
improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload.
Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality
of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist
assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized
images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition
skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Real-world object detection is a challenging task where the captured
images/videos often suffer from complex degradations due to various adverse
weather conditions such as rain, fog, snow, low-light, etc. Despite extensive
prior efforts, most existing methods are designed for one specific type of
adverse weather with constraints of poor generalization, under-utilization of
visual features while handling various image degradations. Leveraging a
theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather
images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of
object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object
detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the
proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that
adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing
irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation
across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D
achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather
degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards
unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures,
highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.

Motivation: Generative models are not widely used in mechanical design because of limited dataset size and variability.

Method: The study proposes a deep learning-based optimization framework that uses positional encoding and Lipschitz regularization to learn geometric features and maintain a meaningful latent space.

Result: The approach shows robustness, generalizability, and effectiveness in overcoming traditional optimization framework limitations through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The methodology is validated via multi-objective shape optimization on diverse 3D datasets, demonstrating versatility in generating practical and high-quality designs with limited data.

Abstract: Generative models have attracted considerable attention for their ability to
produce novel shapes. However, their application in mechanical design remains
constrained due to the limited size and variability of available datasets. This
study proposes a deep learning-based optimization framework specifically
tailored for shape optimization with limited datasets, leveraging positional
encoding and a Lipschitz regularization term to robustly learn geometric
characteristics and maintain a meaningful latent space. Through extensive
experiments, the proposed approach demonstrates robustness, generalizability
and effectiveness in addressing typical limitations of conventional
optimization frameworks. The validity of the methodology is confirmed through
multi-objective shape optimization experiments conducted on diverse
three-dimensional datasets, including wheels and cars, highlighting the model's
versatility in producing practical and high-quality design outcomes even under
data-constrained conditions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It has become mainstream to deploy Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models
on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the help of the cloud to
provide users with a variety of high-quality services. Most existing methods
have two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data
collected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and
transmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear
transformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature
maps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to
improve the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution
filters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small
set of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on
vanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several
groups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse
feature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively
reduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training
by setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not
updating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by
using NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated
based on sliding windows. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CIFAR-10-C,
Icons50, and ImageNet-1K datasets in NVIDIA RTX GPU platforms show that the
proposed GroupNL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in model robust and
training acceleration. Specifically, on the Icons-50 dataset, the accuracy of
GroupNL-ResNet-18 achieves approximately 2.86% higher than the vanilla
ResNet-18. GroupNL improves training speed by about 53% compared to vanilla CNN
when trained on a cluster of 8 NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models for video

harmful content, biases, hallucinations, and privacy risks, undermine
reliability due to video data's spatiotemporal complexities. This study
introduces Trust-videoLLMs, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating videoLLMs
across five dimensions: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and
privacy. Comprising 30 tasks with adapted, synthetic, and annotated videos, the
framework assesses dynamic visual scenarios, cross-modal interactions, and
real-world safety concerns. Our evaluation of 23 state-of-the-art videoLLMs (5
commercial,18 open-source) reveals significant limitations in dynamic visual
scene understanding and cross-modal perturbation resilience. Open-source
videoLLMs show occasional truthfulness advantages but inferior overall
credibility compared to commercial models, with data diversity outperforming
scale effects. These findings highlight the need for advanced safety alignment
to enhance capabilities. Trust-videoLLMs provides a publicly available,
extensible toolbox for standardized trustworthiness assessments, bridging the
gap between accuracy-focused benchmarks and critical demands for robustness,
safety, fairness, and privacy.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
performance in many downstream tasks. However, LVLMs are trained on large-scale
datasets, which can pose privacy risks if training images contain sensitive
information. Therefore, it is important to detect whether an image is used to
train the LVLM. Recent studies have investigated membership inference attacks
(MIAs) against LVLMs, including detecting image-text pairs and single-modality
content. In this work, we focus on detecting whether a target image is used to
train the target LVLM. We design simple yet effective Image Corruption-Inspired
Membership Inference Attacks (ICIMIA) against LLVLMs, which are inspired by
LVLM's different sensitivity to image corruption for member and non-member
images. We first perform an MIA method under the white-box setting, where we
can obtain the embeddings of the image through the vision part of the target
LVLM. The attacks are based on the embedding similarity between the image and
its corrupted version. We further explore a more practical scenario where we
have no knowledge about target LVLMs and we can only query the target LVLMs
with an image and a question. We then conduct the attack by utilizing the
output text embeddings' similarity. Experiments on existing datasets validate
the effectiveness of our proposed attack methods under those two different
settings.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to enable AI models to continuously
learn from sequentially arriving data of different classes over time while
retaining previously acquired knowledge. Recently, Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like prompt pool-based approaches and adapter
tuning, have shown great attraction in CIL. However, these methods either
introduce additional parameters that increase memory usage, or rely on rigid
regularization techniques which reduce forgetting but compromise model
flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Elastic Knowledge
Preservation and Compensation (EKPC) method, integrating Importance-aware
Parameter Regularization (IPR) and Trainable Semantic Drift Compensation (TSDC)
for CIL. Specifically, the IPR method assesses the sensitivity of network
parameters to prior tasks using a novel parameter-importance algorithm. It then
selectively constrains updates within the shared adapter according to these
importance values, thereby preserving previously acquired knowledge while
maintaining the model's flexibility. However, it still exhibits slight semantic
differences in previous knowledge to accommodate new incremental tasks, leading
to decision boundaries confusion in classifier. To eliminate this confusion,
TSDC trains a unified classifier by compensating prototypes with trainable
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on five CIL benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performances to existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is crucial in medical imaging to ensure
reliable diagnosis and effective treatment planning. This study introduces a
novel double ensembling framework that synergistically combines pre-trained
deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction with optimized machine
learning (ML) classifiers for robust classification. The framework incorporates

dual-level ensembling strategy: feature-level ensembling, which integrates deep
features from the top-performing ViT models, and classifier-level ensembling,
which aggregates predictions from hyperparameter-optimized ML classifiers.
Experiments on two public Kaggle MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrate that this
approach significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the
importance of feature and classifier fusion. The proposed methodology also
highlights the critical roles of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and advanced
preprocessing techniques in improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability,
advancing the integration of DL and ML for clinically relevant medical image
analysis.

Abstract: The advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has significantly
reduced the computational burden of adapting large-scale pretrained models to
diverse downstream tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle to
achieve robust performance under domain shifts while maintaining computational
efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Low-rAnk Regulated Gradient
Projection (LARGO) algorithm that integrates dynamic constraints into low-rank
adaptation methods. Specifically, LARGO incorporates parallel trainable
gradient projections to dynamically regulate layer-wise updates, retaining the
Out-Of-Distribution robustness of pretrained model while preserving inter-layer
independence. Additionally, it ensures computational efficiency by mitigating
the influence of gradient dependencies across layers during weight updates.
Besides, through leveraging singular value decomposition of pretrained weights
for structured initialization, we incorporate an SVD-based initialization
strategy that minimizing deviation from pretrained knowledge. Through extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks, LARGO achieves state-of-the-art performance
across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrating improved
robustness under domain shifts with significantly lower computational overhead
compared to existing PEFT methods. The source code will be released soon.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for novel
view synthesis. However, existing methods struggle to adaptively optimize the
distribution of Gaussian primitives based on scene characteristics, making it
challenging to balance reconstruction quality and efficiency. Inspired by human
perception, we propose scene-adaptive perceptual densification for Gaussian
Splatting (Perceptual-GS), a novel framework that integrates perceptual
sensitivity into the 3DGS training process to address this challenge. We first
introduce a perception-aware representation that models human visual
sensitivity while constraining the number of Gaussian primitives. Building on
this foundation, we develop a \cameraready{perceptual sensitivity-adaptive
distribution} to allocate finer Gaussian granularity to visually critical
regions, enhancing reconstruction quality and robustness. Extensive evaluations
on multiple datasets, including BungeeNeRF for large-scale scenes, demonstrate
that Perceptual-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction
quality, efficiency, and robustness. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) plays a crucial role in robotic localization
and navigation. The key challenge lies in constructing feature representations
that are robust to environmental changes. Existing methods typically adopt
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision Transformers (ViTs) as feature
extractors. However, these architectures excel in different aspects -- CNNs are
effective at capturing local details. At the same time, ViTs are better suited
for modeling global context, making it difficult to leverage the strengths of
both. To address this issue, we propose a local-global feature complementation
network (LGCN) for VPR which integrates a parallel CNN-ViT hybrid architecture
with a dynamic feature fusion module (DFM). The DFM performs dynamic feature
fusion through joint modeling of spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Furthermore, to enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of the ViT branch
for VPR tasks, we introduce lightweight frequency-to-spatial fusion adapters
into the frozen ViT backbone. These adapters enable task-specific adaptation
with controlled parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple VPR
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed LGCN consistently outperforms
existing approaches in terms of localization accuracy and robustness,
validating its effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: Continual learning in vision-language models (VLMs) faces critical challenges
in balancing parameter efficiency, memory consumption, and optimization
stability. While First-Order (FO) optimization (e.g., SGD) dominate current
approaches, their deterministic gradients often trap models in suboptimal local
minima and incur substantial memory overhead. This paper pioneers a systematic
exploration of Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization for vision-language continual
learning (VLCL). We first identify the incompatibility of naive full-ZO
adoption in VLCL due to modality-specific instability. To resolve this, we
selectively applying ZO to either vision or language modalities while retaining
FO in the complementary branch. Furthermore, we develop a layer-wise
optimization paradigm that interleaves ZO and FO across network layers,
capitalizing on the heterogeneous learning dynamics of shallow versus deep
representations. A key theoretical insight reveals that ZO perturbations in
vision branches exhibit higher variance than language counterparts, prompting a
gradient sign normalization mechanism with modality-specific perturbation
constraints. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing memory consumption by
89.1% compared to baselines. Code will be available upon publication.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Person Re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve images of the same
individual captured across non-overlapping camera views, making it a critical
component of intelligent surveillance systems. Traditional ReID methods assume
that the training and test domains share similar characteristics and primarily
focus on learning discriminative features within a given domain. However, they
often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to domain shifts caused by
variations in viewpoint, background, and lighting conditions. To address this
issue, Domain-Adaptive ReID (DA-ReID) methods have been proposed. These
approaches incorporate unlabeled target domain data during training and improve
performance by aligning feature distributions between source and target
domains. Domain-Generalizable ReID (DG-ReID) tackles a more realistic and
challenging setting by aiming to learn domain-invariant features without
relying on any target domain data. Recent methods have explored various
strategies to enhance generalization across diverse environments, but the field
remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
survey of DG-ReID. We first review the architectural components of DG-ReID
including the overall setting, commonly used backbone networks and multi-source
input configurations. Then, we categorize and analyze domain generalization
modules that explicitly aim to learn domain-invariant and
identity-discriminative representations. To examine the broader applicability
of these techniques, we further conduct a case study on a related task that
also involves distribution shifts. Finally, we discuss recent trends, open
challenges, and promising directions for future research in DG-ReID. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic survey dedicated to
DG-ReID.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have become popular in medical image

strengths and convolutional layers' local representation advantages to enhance
feature learning. In addition, we also propose an efficient multi-scale feature
fusion module that integrates spatial attention mechanisms, which Integrating
feature information from different layers enhances the feature representation
ability of the model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a non-public

Motivation: In serious crimes like sexual abuse, hand images are often the only identifiable evidence, but existing methods for person identification from hand images are limited.

Method: CLIP-HandID uses CLIP's image encoder with textual prompts as semantic guidance, and a textual inversion network to learn pseudo-tokens that represent visual contexts or appearance attributes.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches on two large, multi-ethnic hand datasets.

Conclusion: CLIP-HandID is effective for person identification from hand images, especially in cases where other evidence is unavailable.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to person identification based on hand
images, designed specifically for criminal investigations. The method is
particularly valuable in serious crimes like sexual abuse, where hand images
are often the sole identifiable evidence available. Our proposed method,
CLIP-HandID, leverages pre-trained foundational vision-language model,
particularly CLIP, to efficiently learn discriminative deep feature
representations from hand images given as input to the image encoder of CLIP
using textual prompts as semantic guidance. We propose to learn pseudo-tokens
that represent specific visual contexts or appearance attributes using textual
inversion network since labels of hand images are indexes instead text
descriptions. The learned pseudo-tokens are incorporated into textual prompts
which are given as input to the text encoder of the CLIP to leverage its
multi-modal reasoning to enhance its generalization for identification. Through
extensive evaluations on two large, publicly available hand datasets with
multi-ethnic representation, we show that our method substantially surpasses
existing approaches.

Abstract: This study presents a novel demographics informed deep learning framework

The proposed model employs an encoder-decoder architecture with temporal gated

accurately forecast future spatial transformations. The study also introduces a
demographics prediction component which ensures that predicted satellite
imagery are consistent with demographic features, significantly enhancing
physiological realism and socioeconomic accuracy. The framework is enhanced by
a proposed multi-objective loss function complemented by a semantic loss
function that balances visual realism with temporal coherence. The experimental
results from this study demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
model compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving higher structural
similarity (SSIM: 0.8342) and significantly improved demographic consistency
(Demo-loss: 0.14 versus 0.95 and 0.96 for baseline models). Additionally, the
study validates co-evolutionary theories of urban development, demonstrating
quantifiable bidirectional influences between built environment characteristics
and population patterns. The study also contributes a comprehensive multimodal

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Image edge detection (ED) faces a fundamental mismatch between training and
inference: models are trained using continuous-valued outputs but evaluated
using binary predictions. This misalignment, caused by the
non-differentiability of binarization, weakens the link between learning
objectives and actual task performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical
method to design a Binarization-Aware Adjuster (BAA), which explicitly
incorporates binarization behavior into gradient-based optimization. At the
core of BAA is a novel loss adjustment mechanism based on a Distance Weight
Function (DWF), which reweights pixel-wise contributions according to their
correctness and proximity to the decision boundary. This emphasizes
decision-critical regions while down-weighting less influential ones. We also
introduce a self-adaptive procedure to estimate the optimal binarization
threshold for BAA, further aligning training dynamics with inference behavior.
Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Beyond ED, BAA offers a generalizable strategy
for bridging the gap between continuous optimization and discrete evaluation in
structured prediction tasks.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to boost the generalization capability of a
trained model by conducting self-/unsupervised learning during the testing
phase. While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual
supervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent
audio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates
audio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic
content of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the
context of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping
method by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals
extracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video
label spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection
between the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the
generated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines
the optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes
in loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized
adaptation process for each sample. Experimental results on two widely used
datasets (UCF101-C and Kinetics-Sounds-C), as well as on two newly constructed
audio-video TTA datasets (AVE-C and AVMIT-C) with various corruption types,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our method consistently improves
adaptation performance across different video classification models and
represents a significant step forward in integrating audio information into
video TTA. Code: https://github.com/keikeiqi/Audio-Assisted-TTA.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of deep learning strategies for
detecting hypertensive retinopathy from fundus images, a central task in the
HRDC challenge~\cite{qian2025hrdc}. We investigate three distinct approaches: a
custom CNN, a suite of pre-trained transformer-based models, and an AutoML
solution. Our findings reveal a stark, architecture-dependent response to data
augmentation. Augmentation significantly boosts the performance of pure Vision
Transformers (ViTs), which we hypothesize is due to their weaker inductive
biases, forcing them to learn robust spatial and structural features.
Conversely, the same augmentation strategy degrades the performance of hybrid
ViT-CNN models, whose stronger, pre-existing biases from the CNN component may
be "confused" by the transformations. We show that smaller patch sizes
(ViT-B/8) excel on augmented data, enhancing fine-grained detail capture.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that a powerful self-supervised model like DINOv2
fails on the original, limited dataset but is "rescued" by augmentation,
highlighting the critical need for data diversity to unlock its potential.
Preliminary tests with a ViT-Large model show poor performance, underscoring
the risk of using overly-capacitive models on specialized, smaller datasets.
This work provides critical insights into the interplay between model
architecture, data augmentation, and dataset size for medical image
classification.

Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (WCG) technologies
significantly improve color reproduction compared to standard dynamic range
(SDR) and standard color gamuts, resulting in more accurate, richer, and more
immersive images. However, HDR increases data demands, posing challenges for
bandwidth efficiency and compression techniques.
  Advances in compression and display technologies require more precise image
quality assessment, particularly in the high-fidelity range where perceptual
differences are subtle.
  To address this gap, we introduce AIC-HDR2025, the first such HDR dataset,
comprising 100 test images generated from five HDR sources, each compressed
using four codecs at five compression levels. It covers the high-fidelity
range, from visible distortions to compression levels below the visually
lossless threshold.
  A subjective study was conducted using the JPEG AIC-3 test methodology,
combining plain and boosted triplet comparisons. In total, 34,560 ratings were
collected from 151 participants across four fully controlled labs. The results
confirm that AIC-3 enables precise HDR quality estimation, with 95\% confidence
intervals averaging a width of 0.27 at 1 JND. In addition, several recently
proposed objective metrics were evaluated based on their correlation with
subjective ratings. The dataset is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods struggle with ambiguity due to lack of additional information, and different users may have different criteria for clustering. Existing text-guided methods don't fully capture user intent.

Method: ITGC uses an iterative discovery process with an unsupervised clustering objective to generate visual concepts from user instructions.

Result: ITGC outperforms existing methods on various image clustering and fine-grained classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Text-guided clustering with iterative discovery can better align clusters with user intent by capturing their specified criteria through interpretable visual concepts.

Abstract: Traditional clustering methods aim to group unlabeled data points based on
their similarity to each other. However, clustering, in the absence of
additional information, is an ill-posed problem as there may be many different,
yet equally valid, ways to partition a dataset. Distinct users may want to use
different criteria to form clusters in the same data, e.g. shape v.s. color.
Recently introduced text-guided image clustering methods aim to address this
ambiguity by allowing users to specify the criteria of interest using natural
language instructions. This instruction provides the necessary context and
control needed to obtain clusters that are more aligned with the users' intent.
We propose a new text-guided clustering approach named ITGC that uses an
iterative discovery process, guided by an unsupervised clustering objective, to
generate interpretable visual concepts that better capture the criteria
expressed in a user's instructions. We report superior performance compared to
existing methods across a wide variety of image clustering and fine-grained
classification benchmarks.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in existing research that assumes uniform distribution, whereas real-world data typically has a long-tailed distribution with some categories having many examples and others few.

Method: The method involves a framework combining confident sample selection and density-based clustering to handle the challenges of balancing classifier learning and estimating the number of categories in long-tailed distributions.

Result: The results show that the proposed method is effective on both long-tailed and conventional GCD datasets.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the paper successfully addresses the challenges of GCD under long-tailed distributions through their framework, suggesting potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)
under a long-tailed distribution, which involves discovering novel categories
in an unlabelled dataset using knowledge from a set of labelled categories.
Existing works assume a uniform distribution for both datasets, but real-world
data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, where a few categories contain
most examples, while others have only a few. While the long-tailed distribution
is well-studied in supervised and semi-supervised settings, it remains
unexplored in the GCD context. We identify two challenges in this setting -
balancing classifier learning and estimating category numbers - and propose a
framework based on confident sample selection and density-based clustering to
tackle them. Our experiments on both long-tailed and conventional GCD datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive
state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion
artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as
attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic,
inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing
event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or
requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i)
Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while
preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement,
which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial
jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy
metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness
of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal
complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency
of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks
such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on
controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with
multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of achieving seamless continuity in diffusion-based inpainting models, which still face discrepancy issues despite advances in generative models.

Method: The paper proposes a modified Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to correct color imbalances and a two-step training strategy to enhance blending of generated and existing image content during diffusion.

Result: The methods effectively reduce discontinuity and produce high-quality inpainting results that are coherent and visually appealing, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed methods contribute to more seamless and visually appealing image inpainting by tackling color mismatches and improving content blending during the diffusion process.

Abstract: Image inpainting is the task of reconstructing missing or damaged parts of an
image in a way that seamlessly blends with the surrounding content. With the
advent of advanced generative models, especially diffusion models and
generative adversarial networks, inpainting has achieved remarkable
improvements in visual quality and coherence. However, achieving seamless
continuity remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose two novel

First, we introduce a modified Variational Autoencoder that corrects color
imbalances, ensuring that the final inpainted results are free of color
mismatches. Second, we propose a two-step training strategy that improves the
blending of generated and existing image content during the diffusion process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods effectively

Abstract: Freezing of gait (FoG) is a special symptom found in patients with
Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients who have FoG abruptly lose the capacity to
walk as they normally would. Accelerometers worn by patients can record
movement data during these episodes, and machine learning algorithms can be
useful to categorize this information. Thus, the combination may be able to
identify FoG in real time. In order to identify FoG events in accelerometer
data, we introduce the Transformer Encoder-Bi-LSTM fusion model in this paper.
The model's capability to differentiate between FoG episodes and normal
movement was used to evaluate its performance, and on the Kaggle Parkinson's
Freezing of Gait dataset, the proposed Transformer Encoder-Bi-LSTM fusion model
produced 92.6% accuracy, 80.9% F1 score, and 52.06% in terms of mean average
precision. The findings highlight how Deep Learning-based approaches may
progress the field of FoG identification and help PD patients receive better

Abstract: Traditional image similarity metrics are ineffective at evaluating the
similarity between a real image of a scene and an artificially generated
version of that viewpoint [6, 9, 13, 14]. Our research evaluates the
effectiveness of a new, perceptual-based similarity metric, DreamSim [2], and
three popular image similarity metrics: Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity
(LPIPS) [18, 19] in novel view synthesis (NVS) applications. We create a corpus
of artificially corrupted images to quantify the sensitivity and discriminative
power of each of the image similarity metrics. These tests reveal that
traditional metrics are unable to effectively differentiate between images with
minor pixel-level changes and those with substantial corruption, whereas
DreamSim is more robust to minor defects and can effectively evaluate the
high-level similarity of the image. Additionally, our results demonstrate that
DreamSim provides a more effective and useful evaluation of render quality,
especially for evaluating NVS renders in real-world use cases where slight
rendering corruptions are common, but do not affect image utility for human
tasks.

Abstract: The concept bottleneck model (CBM), as a technique improving interpretability
via linking predictions to human-understandable concepts, makes high-risk and
life-critical medical image classification credible. Typically, existing CBM
methods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain
the model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of
concept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated
with the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a
blind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and
thus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts,
impairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Multi-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM),
which comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference
modeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with
features at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse
activation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple
layers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept
preferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual
information to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model
decisions. Extensive experiments on several public medical classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MVP-CBM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
interoperability, verifying its superiority. Code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In recent years, large transformer-based video encoder models have greatly
advanced state-of-the-art performance on video classification tasks. However,
these large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from
multiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach
fails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video
durations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature
significance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require
significant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them
impractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model
performance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our
framework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of
embeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS). An MTS naturally
preserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then
learn per-timestep, per-feature weights over the encoded MTS frames, allowing
us to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a
new neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment
algorithms for this learning task. Our evaluation demonstrates that DejaVid
substantially improves the performance of a state-of-the-art large encoder,
achieving leading Top-1 accuracy of 77.2% on Something-Something V2, 89.1% on
Kinetics-400, and 88.6% on HMDB51, while adding fewer than 1.8% additional
learnable parameters and requiring less than 3 hours of training time. Our code

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they remain prone to visual
hallucination (VH), often producing confident but incorrect descriptions of
visual content. We present VisFlow, an efficient and training-free framework
designed to mitigate VH by directly manipulating attention patterns during
inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify three key pathological
attention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) weak visual grounding, where attention to
visual tokens is insufficient or misallocated, over-focusing on uninformative
regions; (2) language prior dominance, where excessive attention to prior
response tokens reinforces autoregressive patterns and impairs multimodal
alignment; (3) prompt redundancy, where many attention heads fixate on system
prompt tokens, disrupting the integration of image, instruction, and response
content. To address these issues, we introduce two inference-time
interventions: token-level attention intervention (TAI), which enhances focus
on salient visual content, and head-level attention intervention (HAI), which
suppresses over-attention to prompt and nearby text tokens. VisFlow operates
without additional training or model modifications. Extensive experiments
across models and benchmarks show that VisFlow effectively reduces
hallucinations and improves visual factuality, with negligible computational
cost.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable advancements but at the cost of

novel and energy-efficient computational fabric. CMOS Oscillator Networks
(OscNet) is a brain inspired and specially designed hardware for low energy

learning algorithm that can be implemented on OscNet. The network is trained
using forward propagation alone to learn sparsely connected weights, yet
achieves an 8% improvement in accuracy compared to conventional deep learning
models on MNIST dataset. OscNet v1.5 achieves competitive accuracy on MNIST and
is well-suited for implementation using CMOS-compatible ring oscillator arrays
with SHIL. In oscillator-based implementation, we utilize only 24% of the
connections used in a fully connected Hopfield network, with merely a 0.1% drop

sparse connections, making it an energy-efficient machine learning pipeline

dataset of 2,413 UI instructional videos, which spans over 167 hours. These
videos are manually annotated for video segmentation, text summarization, and
video summarization, which enable the comprehensive evaluations for concise and
executable video summarization. We conduct extensive experiments on our

summarization methods struggle on UI video summarization, and highlight the
importance of new methods for UI instructional video summarization.

<details>

Motivation: Previous studies needed external models for image evaluation, which isn't feasible on GPUs with limited VRAM. This paper aims to address that by optimizing initial noise without external models.

Method: Best-of-N inference-time scaling applied to algorithms that optimize initial noise of diffusion models across multiple datasets and backbones.

Result: Inference-time scaling quickly reaches performance plateau, with few optimization steps achieving maximum performance.

Conclusion: Optimizing initial noise via Best-of-N scaling without external models is effective, suggesting that minimal steps can yield optimal results in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that investing computing resources in searching
for good initial noise for a text-to-image diffusion model helps improve
performance. However, previous studies required external models to evaluate the
resulting images, which is impossible on GPUs with small VRAM. For these
reasons, we apply Best-of-N inference-time scaling to algorithms that optimize
the initial noise of a diffusion model without external models across multiple
datasets and backbones. We demonstrate that inference-time scaling for
text-to-image diffusion models in this setting quickly reaches a performance
plateau, and a relatively small number of optimization steps suffices to
achieve the maximum achievable performance with each algorithm.

Abstract: The malformed hands in the AI-generated images seriously affect the
authenticity of the images. To refine malformed hands, existing depth-based
approaches use a hand depth estimator to guide the refinement of malformed
hands. Due to the performance limitations of the hand depth estimator, many
hand details cannot be represented, resulting in errors in the generated hands,
such as confusing the palm and the back of the hand. To solve this problem, we
propose a 3D mesh-guided refinement framework using a diffusion pipeline. We
use a state-of-the-art 3D hand mesh estimator, which provides more details of
the hands. For training, we collect and reannotate a dataset consisting of RGB
images and 3D hand mesh. Then we design a diffusion inpainting model to
generate refined outputs guided by 3D hand meshes. For inference, we propose a
double check algorithm to facilitate the 3D hand mesh estimator to obtain
robust hand mesh guidance to obtain our refined results. Beyond malformed hand
refinement, we propose a novel hand pose transformation method. It increases
the flexibility and diversity of the malformed hand refinement task. We made
the restored images mimic the hand poses of the reference images. The pose
transformation requires no additional training. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.

Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as
search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it
is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited
feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add
computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in
cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the
Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified
fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost
detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three
synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries
token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight
spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration
Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and
parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and
the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps
to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen
responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone
benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks,
achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an
optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a
practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV
platforms.

Abstract: This work addresses the task of self-supervised learning (SSL) on a
long-tailed dataset that aims to learn balanced and well-separated
representations for downstream tasks such as image classification. This task is
crucial because the real world contains numerous object categories, and their
distributions are inherently imbalanced. Towards robust SSL on a
class-imbalanced dataset, we investigate leveraging a network trained using
unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are prevalently available online.
We first train a network using both in-domain (ID) and sampled OOD data by
back-propagating the proposed pseudo semantic discrimination loss alongside a
domain discrimination loss. The OOD data sampling and loss functions are
designed to learn a balanced and well-separated embedding space. Subsequently,
we further optimize the network on ID data by unsupervised contrastive learning
while using the previously trained network as a guiding network. The guiding
network is utilized to select positive/negative samples and to control the
strengths of attractive/repulsive forces in contrastive learning. We also
distil and transfer its embedding space to the training network to maintain
balancedness and separability. Through experiments on four publicly available
long-tailed datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable

remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality,
posing significant security concerns. Building upon our previous work on
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), which introduced learnable text prompts to
enhance adversarial robustness in VLMs without extensive parameter training, we
present a significant extension by introducing the Neural Augmentor framework
for Multi-modal Adversarial Prompt Tuning (NAP-Tuning).Our key innovations
include: (1) extending AdvPT from text-only to multi-modal prompting across
both text and visual modalities, (2) expanding from single-layer to multi-layer
prompt architectures, and (3) proposing a novel architecture-level redesign
through our Neural Augmentor approach, which implements feature purification to
directly address the distortions introduced by adversarial attacks in feature
space. Our NAP-Tuning approach incorporates token refiners that learn to
reconstruct purified features through residual connections, allowing for
modality-specific and layer-specific feature correction.Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that NAP-Tuning significantly outperforms existing
methods across various datasets and attack types. Notably, our approach shows
significant improvements over the strongest baselines under the challenging
AutoAttack benchmark, outperforming them by 33.5% on ViT-B16 and 33.0% on
ViT-B32 architectures while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Abstract: The segmentation of coal maceral groups can be described as a semantic

significance for studying the chemical properties of coal. Generally, existing
semantic segmentation models of coal maceral groups use the method of stacking
parameters to achieve higher accuracy. It leads to increased computational
requirements and impacts model training efficiency. At the same time, due to
the professionalism and diversity of coal maceral group images sampling,
obtaining the number of samples for model training requires a long time and
professional personnel operation. To address these issues, We have innovatively
developed an IoT-based DA-VIT parallel network model. By utilizing this model,
we can continuously broaden the dataset through IoT and achieving sustained
improvement in the accuracy of coal maceral groups segmentation. Besides, we
decouple the parallel network from the backbone network to ensure the normal
using of the backbone network during model data updates. Secondly, DCSA
mechanism of DA-VIT is introduced to enhance the local feature information of
coal microscopic images. This DCSA can decompose the large kernels of
convolutional attention into multiple scales and reduce 81.18% of
parameters.Finally, we performed the contrast experiment and ablation
experiment between DA-VIT and state-of-the-art methods at lots of evaluation

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating dynamic 4D scenes from monocular,
multi-object videos with heavy occlusions, and introduce GenMOJO, a novel
approach that integrates rendering-based deformable 3D Gaussian optimization
with generative priors for view synthesis. While existing models perform well
on novel view synthesis for isolated objects, they struggle to generalize to
complex, cluttered scenes. To address this, GenMOJO decomposes the scene into
individual objects, optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per
object. This object-wise decomposition allows leveraging object-centric
diffusion models to infer unobserved regions in novel viewpoints. It performs
joint Gaussian splatting to render the full scene, capturing cross-object
occlusions, and enabling occlusion-aware supervision. To bridge the gap between
object-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of videos,
GenMOJO uses differentiable transformations that align generative and rendering
constraints within a unified framework. The resulting model generates 4D object
reconstructions over space and time, and produces accurate 2D and 3D point
tracks from monocular input. Quantitative evaluations and perceptual human
studies confirm that GenMOJO generates more realistic novel views of scenes and
produces more accurate point tracks compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for
their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and
low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as
robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration
methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that
these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result,
temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in
visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified
framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning
tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that
reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a
lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key
decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA
actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model
and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive
execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial
redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning
method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based
on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two
mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and
salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining
high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to
1.5$\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming
existing approaches in multiple tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
vision-language understanding and generation tasks. However, existing MLLMs
typically rely on static modality fusion strategies, which treat all modalities
equally regardless of their instance-level reliability or semantic
contribution. This often leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
scenarios with noisy, missing, or misaligned modalities.
  In this paper, we propose Dynamic Modality Scheduling (DMS), a novel
framework that adaptively adjusts the contribution of each modality at a
per-sample level. DMS evaluates each modality based on three key factors: (1)
\textit{confidence}, estimated from predictive entropy; (2)
\textit{uncertainty}, obtained via Monte Carlo dropout; and (3)
\textit{semantic consistency}, computed through inter-modal similarity. These
signals are combined through a learnable or rule-based scheduler to generate
soft modality weights used in downstream fusion.To ensure stable training, we
further introduce a \textit{Modality Weight Consistency Loss}, which
regularizes the fused representation to stay close to unimodal embeddings
proportionally to their assigned weights. Our method is model-agnostic and can
be integrated into existing MLLMs such as BLIP-2 and LLaVA. Experimental
results on VQA, image-text retrieval, and captioning tasks show that DMS
significantly improves both clean and robust performance, especially under
modality corruption or dropout conditions. This work provides a general and
effective mechanism to enable instance-aware and robustness-enhanced multimodal
modeling.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a preferred choice alongside
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in inverse rendering due to its superior
rendering speed. Currently, the common approach in 3DGS is to utilize
"single-view" mini-batch training, where only one image is processed per
iteration, in contrast to NeRF's "multi-view" mini-batch training, which
leverages multiple images. We observe that such single-view training can lead
to suboptimal optimization due to increased variance in mini-batch stochastic
gradients, highlighting the necessity for multi-view training. However,
implementing multi-view training in 3DGS poses challenges. Simply rendering
multiple images per iteration incurs considerable overhead and may result in
suboptimal Gaussian densification due to its reliance on single-view
assumptions. To address these issues, we modify the rasterization process to
minimize the overhead associated with multi-view training and propose a 3D
distance-aware D-SSIM loss and multi-view adaptive density control that better
suits multi-view scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
methods significantly enhance the performance of 3DGS and its variants, freeing
3DGS from the constraints of single-view training.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have achieved impressive progress across a wide

modality reliability and sample complexity. In this paper, we propose
Modality-Aware Adaptive Fusion Scheduling (MA-AFS), a general framework that
learns to dynamically modulate the contribution of each modality on a
per-instance basis. MA-AFS introduces a lightweight neural scheduler that
predicts modality fusion weights by integrating visual and textual entropy
signals along with cross-modal agreement cues. This enables the model to
adaptively emphasize more reliable modalities, especially under noisy, missing,
or misaligned inputs. We formulate the fusion process as a differentiable
scheduling mechanism, analyze its theoretical consistency and regularization
effect, and demonstrate that it improves robustness without increasing model
capacity significantly. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval,
captioning, and visual question answering show that MA-AFS achieves consistent
performance gains over strong baselines such as CLIP, ALBEF, and BLIP.
Moreover, MA-AFS exhibits improved robustness under modality corruption and
enhanced generalization under domain shifts. Our work highlights the importance
of adaptive fusion and opens a promising direction toward reliable and
uncertainty-aware multimodal learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature coding methods are architecture-specific, limiting their use in real-world scenarios where both CNN and Transformer features coexist.

Method: A two-step distribution alignment method: format alignment to unify features into a 2D token format, and feature value alignment via truncation and normalization to harmonize distributions.

Result: Superior rate-accuracy trade-offs compared to architecture-specific baselines in image classification tasks.

Conclusion: This work is a first step toward universal feature compression across different model architectures.

Abstract: Feature coding has become increasingly important in scenarios where semantic
representations rather than raw pixels are transmitted and stored. However,
most existing methods are architecture-specific, targeting either CNNs or
Transformers. This design limits their applicability in real-world scenarios
where features from both architectures coexist. To address this gap, we
introduce a new research problem: cross-architecture universal feature coding
(CAUFC), which seeks to build a unified codec that can effectively compress
features from heterogeneous architectures. To tackle this challenge, we propose
a two-step distribution alignment method. First, we design the format alignment
method that unifies CNN and Transformer features into a consistent 2D token
format. Second, we propose the feature value alignment method that harmonizes
statistical distributions via truncation and normalization. As a first attempt
to study CAUFC, we evaluate our method on the image classification task.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior
rate-accuracy trade-offs compared to the architecture-specific baseline. This
work marks an initial step toward universal feature compression across
heterogeneous model architectures.

Abstract: Blind Super-Resolution (blind SR) aims to enhance the model's generalization
ability with unknown degradation, yet it still encounters severe overfitting
issues. Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances
generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind
SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before
the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at
intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at
intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized
feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying
dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which
we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it
introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method
for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates
application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for
training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate
the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in
generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an
adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise
annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past
regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets,
also highly effective in other image restoration tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset
often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a
robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present
during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We
propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models
to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two
sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance
classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an
object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features.
It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts,
enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we
incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation
performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures
category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby
enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label
tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in
various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Infrared small target (IRST) detection is challenging in simultaneously
achieving precise, universal, robust and efficient performance due to extremely
dim targets and strong interference. Current learning-based methods attempt to
leverage ``more" information from both the spatial and the short-term temporal
domains, but suffer from unreliable performance under complex conditions while
incurring computational redundancy. In this paper, we explore the ``more
essential" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through
theoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and
correlation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant
superiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate
whether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks,
we built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the
importance of the temporal profile information. Inspired by the above
conclusions, we remodel the IRST detection task as a one-dimensional signal
anomaly detection task, and propose an efficient deep temporal probe network
(DeepPro) that only performs calculations in the time dimension for IRST
detection. We conducted extensive experiments to fully validate the
effectiveness of our method. The experimental results are exciting, as our
DeepPro outperforms existing state-of-the-art IRST detection methods on
widely-used benchmarks with extremely high efficiency, and achieves a
significant improvement on dim targets and in complex scenarios. We provide a
new modeling domain, a new insight, a new method, and a new performance, which
can promote the development of IRST detection. Codes are available at

Abstract: DL based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection has tremendous
advantages in numerous areas. However, it still faces some problems, such as
the lack of prior knowledge, which seriously affects detection accuracy. In
order to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method
based on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical
two-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and
sea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module
(LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on
land according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add
prior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby
reducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore
detection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection
and enhances the interpretability of the model. Specifically, in consideration
of the lack of land sea segmentation labels in existing deep learning-based SAR
ship detection datasets, ULSM uses an unsupervised approach to classify the
input data scene into inshore and offshore types and performs sea-land
segmentation for inshore scenes. LASM uses the sea-land segmentation
information as prior knowledge to reduce the network's attention to land. We
conducted our experiments using the publicly available SSDD dataset, which
demonstrated the effectiveness of our network.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face significant challenges when dealing with
the diverse resolutions and aspect ratios of real-world images, as most
existing models rely on fixed, low-resolution inputs. While recent studies have
explored integrating native resolution visual encoding to improve model
performance, such efforts remain fragmented and lack a systematic framework
within the open-source community. Moreover, existing benchmarks fall short in
evaluating VLMs under varied visual conditions, often neglecting resolution as
a critical factor. To address the "Resolution Dilemma" stemming from both model
design and benchmark limitations, we introduce RC-Bench, a novel benchmark
specifically designed to systematically evaluate VLM capabilities under extreme
visual conditions, with an emphasis on resolution and aspect ratio variations.
In conjunction, we propose NativeRes-LLaVA, an open-source training framework
that empowers VLMs to effectively process images at their native resolutions
and aspect ratios. Based on RC-Bench and NativeRes-LLaVA, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on existing visual encoding strategies. The results
show that Native Resolution Visual Encoding significantly improves the
performance of VLMs on RC-Bench as well as other resolution-centric benchmarks.

Abstract: The advent of 6G networks demands unprecedented levels of intelligence,
adaptability, and efficiency to address challenges such as ultra-high-speed
data transmission, ultra-low latency, and massive connectivity in dynamic
environments. Traditional wireless image transmission frameworks, reliant on
static configurations and isolated source-channel coding, struggle to balance
computational efficiency, robustness, and quality under fluctuating channel
conditions. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an AI-native deep joint
source-channel coding (JSCC) framework tailored for resource-constrained 6G
networks. Our approach integrates key information extraction and adaptive
background synthesis to enable intelligent, semantic-aware transmission.
Leveraging AI-driven tools, Mediapipe for human pose detection and Rembg for
background removal, the model dynamically isolates foreground features and
matches backgrounds from a pre-trained library, reducing data payloads while
preserving visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) compared with traditional
JSCC method, especially under low-SNR conditions. This approach offers a
practical solution for multimedia services in resource-constrained mobile
communications.

Abstract: Modeling the wireless radiance field (WRF) is fundamental to modern
communication systems, enabling key tasks such as localization, sensing, and
channel estimation. Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or
physical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong
scene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve
reconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their
reliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries
hinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
Gaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in
modeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF
reconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian
splatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under
single-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated
rasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP
to model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing
mobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the
efficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in
angle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
prediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor
scenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster
than existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its
signal quality. Code and datasets will be released.

Abstract: Single-view textured human reconstruction aims to reconstruct a clothed 3D

feed-forward methods, limited by scarce 3D human data, and diffusion-based
methods, prone to erroneous 2D hallucinations. To address these issues, we
propose a novel SMPL normal map Equipped 3D Human Reconstruction (SEHR)
framework, integrating a pretrained large 3D reconstruction model with human
geometry prior. SEHR performs single-view human reconstruction without using a
preset diffusion model in one forward propagation. Concretely, SEHR consists of
two key components: SMPL Normal Map Guidance (SNMG) and SMPL Normal Map
Constraint (SNMC). SNMG incorporates SMPL normal maps into an auxiliary network
to provide improved body shape guidance. SNMC enhances invisible body parts by
constraining the model to predict an extra SMPL normal Gaussians. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEHR outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Overfitting to synthetic training pairs remains a critical challenge in image
dehazing, leading to poor generalization capability to real-world scenarios. To
address this issue, existing approaches utilize unpaired realistic data for
training, employing CycleGAN or contrastive learning frameworks. Despite their
progress, these methods often suffer from training instability, resulting in
limited dehazing performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training
strategy for unpaired image dehazing, termed Rehazy, to improve both dehazing
performance and training stability. This strategy explores the consistency of
the underlying clean images across hazy images and utilizes hazy-rehazy pairs
for effective learning of real haze characteristics. To favorably construct
hazy-rehazy pairs, we develop a physics-based rehazy generation pipeline, which
is theoretically validated to reliably produce high-quality rehazy images.
Additionally, leveraging the rehazy strategy, we introduce a dual-branch
framework for dehazing network training, where a clean branch provides a basic
dehazing capability in a synthetic manner, and a hazy branch enhances the
generalization ability with hazy-rehazy pairs. Moreover, we design a new
dehazing network within these branches to improve the efficiency, which
progressively restores clean scenes from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments
on four benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach,
exceeding the previous state-of-the-art methods by 3.58 dB on the SOTS-Indoor
dataset and by 1.85 dB on the SOTS-Outdoor dataset in PSNR. Our code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods for MLLMs require iterative search, leading to high computational costs for on-demand adaptation.

Method: LOP uses autoregressive NNs to predict layer-wise pruning strategies based on target constraints, bypassing search processes.

Result: LOP surpasses existing methods in metrics and provides up to 1000x speedup.

Conclusion: LOP offers an efficient solution for deploying MLLMs by eliminating the need for costly iterative pruning searches.

Abstract: Structural pruning techniques are essential for deploying multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) across various hardware platforms, from edge devices to
cloud servers. However, current pruning methods typically determine optimal
strategies through iterative search processes, resulting in substantial
computational overhead for on-demand MLLMs adaptation. To address this

optimal pruning strategies from the target pruning constraint, eliminating the
need for computationally expensive search-based methods. LOP approach trains
autoregressive neural networks (NNs) to directly predict layer-wise pruning
strategies adaptive to the target pruning constraint, eliminating the
time-consuming iterative searches. Experimental results across multiple tasks
show that LOP outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in various metrics
while achieving up to three orders of magnitude speedup.

existing benchmarks inadequately evaluate such capabilities. Specifically, they

consistency metrics are flawed. To address this, we introduce
ComplexBench-Edit, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess model
performance on complex, multi-instruction, and chain-dependent image editing
tasks. ComplexBench-Edit also features a new vision consistency evaluation
method that accurately assesses non-modified regions by excluding edited areas.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based

decoder to generate NOCS maps with embedded 3D structure and position
information in 2D space from sketches. The 3D point cloud is reconstructed by
combining multiple NOCS maps from different views. To enhance sketch
understanding, we integrate a viewpoint encoder for extracting viewpoint
features. Additionally, we design a feature-level multi-view aggregation
network as the denoising module, facilitating cross-view information exchange
and improving 3D consistency in NOCS map generation. Experiments on ShapeNet
demonstrate that DiffS-NOCS achieves controllable and fine-grained point cloud
reconstruction aligned with sketches.

mechanisms in a parallel manner to capture complementary information.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive local-global interactive context awareness

Abstract: In medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), achieving accurate responses
relies on three critical steps: precise perception of medical imaging data,
logical reasoning grounded in visual input and textual questions, and coherent
answer derivation from the reasoning process. Recent advances in general
vision-language models (VLMs) show that large-scale reinforcement learning (RL)
could significantly enhance both reasoning capabilities and overall model
performance. However, their application in medical domains is hindered by two
fundamental challenges: 1) misalignment between perceptual understanding and
reasoning stages, and 2) inconsistency between reasoning pathways and answer
generation, both compounded by the scarcity of high-quality medical datasets
for effective large-scale RL. In this paper, we first introduce Med-Zero-17K, a
curated dataset for pure RL-based training, encompassing over 30 medical image
modalities and 24 clinical tasks. Moreover, we propose a novel large-scale RL
framework for Med-VLMs, Consistency-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which
integrates rewards to ensure fidelity between perception and reasoning,
consistency in reasoning-to-answer derivation, and rule-based accuracy for
final responses. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain
scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong VLM baselines,
showcasing strong generalization capability to 3D Med-VQA benchmarks and
R1-like training paradigms.

Abstract: Video object removal and inpainting are critical tasks in the fields of
computer vision and multimedia processing, aimed at restoring missing or
corrupted regions in video sequences. Traditional methods predominantly rely on
flow-based propagation and spatio-temporal Transformers, but these approaches
face limitations in effectively leveraging long-term temporal features and
ensuring temporal consistency in the completion results, particularly when
dealing with large masks. Consequently, performance on extensive masked areas
remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel
video inpainting approach leveraging the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiT
synergistically combines the advantages of diffusion models and transformer
architectures to maintain long-term temporal consistency while ensuring
high-quality inpainting results. We propose a Circular Position-Shift strategy
to further enhance long-term temporal consistency during the inference stage.
Additionally, the proposed method automatically detects objects within videos,
interactively removes specified objects, and generates corresponding prompts.
In terms of processing speed, it takes only 180 seconds (testing on one NVIDIA
A100 GPU) to complete a video with a resolution of $1080 \times 1920$ with 121
frames without any acceleration method. Experimental results indicate that the
proposed method demonstrates superior performance in content fidelity, texture

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly propelled the development

can severely mislead these models. In this paper, we address this challenge
with an Adversarial Noise Suppression Module (ANSM) that generate a defensive
perturbation to suppress the attack effect of adversarial noise. We observe
that forgery-relevant features extracted from adversarial and original forged
images exhibit distinct distributions. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Forgery-relevant Features Alignment (FFA) as a first-stage training strategy,
which reduces distributional discrepancies by minimizing the channel-wise
Kullback-Leibler divergence between these features. To further refine the
defensive perturbation, we design a second-stage training strategy, termed
Mask-guided Refinement (MgR), which incorporates a dual-mask constraint. MgR
ensures that the perturbation remains effective for both adversarial and
original forged images, recovering forgery localization accuracy to their
original level. Extensive experiments across various attack algorithms
demonstrate that our method significantly restores the forgery localization
model's performance on adversarial images. Notably, when ANSM is applied to
original forged images, the performance remains nearly unaffected. To our best
knowledge, this is the first report of adversarial defense in image forgery
localization tasks. We have released the source code and anti-forensics
dataset.

### [75] [Intriguing Frequency Interpretation of Adversarial Robustness for CNNs and ViTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12875)
*Lu Chen,Han Yang,Hu Wang,Yuxin Cao,Shaofeng Li,Yuan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the frequency domain characteristics of adversarial examples in image classification, revealing that high-frequency components drive performance gaps, and that Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers differ in their frequency-based attack capabilities. It proposes three strategies for improving model security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial examples are a critical security concern in AI, but their frequency-based properties are not well understood. This study aims to fill that gap by analyzing how frequency components affect model robustness.

Method: The paper investigates the properties of adversarial examples in the frequency domain through experiments, analyzing how high, mid, and low-frequency components influence model performance.

Result: Key findings include: (1) increased high-frequency components widen the performance gap between adversarial and natural examples, (2) model performance against filtered adversarial examples peaks and then declines, and (3) CNNs rely on mid- and high-frequency components for attacks, while Transformers use low- and mid-frequency components.

Conclusion: The study concludes that different network architectures have varying frequency preferences, and the frequency component differences between adversarial and natural examples directly impact model robustness. It proposes three strategies for AI model security.

Abstract: Adversarial examples have attracted significant attention over the years, yet
understanding their frequency-based characteristics remains insufficient. In
this paper, we investigate the intriguing properties of adversarial examples in
the frequency domain for the image classification task, with the following key
findings. (1) As the high-frequency components increase, the performance gap
between adversarial and natural examples becomes increasingly pronounced. (2)
The model performance against filtered adversarial examples initially increases
to a peak and declines to its inherent robustness. (3) In Convolutional Neural
Networks, mid- and high-frequency components of adversarial examples exhibit
their attack capabilities, while in Transformers, low- and mid-frequency
components of adversarial examples are particularly effective. These results
suggest that different network architectures have different frequency
preferences and that differences in frequency components between adversarial
and natural examples may directly influence model robustness. Based on our
findings, we further conclude with three useful proposals that serve as a
valuable reference to the AI model security community.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Conventional benchmarks for crop type classification from optical satellite
time series typically assume access to labeled data from the same year and rely
on fixed calendar-day sampling. This limits generalization across seasons,
where crop phenology shifts due to interannual climate variability, and
precludes real-time application when current-year labels are unavailable.
Furthermore, uncertainty quantification is often neglected, making such
approaches unreliable for crop monitoring applications. Inspired by
ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple,
model-agnostic sampling strategy that leverages growing degree days (GDD),
based on daily average temperature, to replace calendar time with thermal time.
By uniformly subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful domain,
the method emphasizes phenologically active growth stages while reducing
temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the method on a multi-year
Sentinel-2 dataset spanning all of Switzerland, training on one growing season
and testing on other seasons. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our
method delivers substantial gains in classification accuracy and, critically,
produces more calibrated uncertainty estimates. Notably, our method excels in
low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season
classification. With only 10 percent of the training data, our method surpasses
the state-of-the-art baseline in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty
estimation, and by the end of June, it achieves performance similar to a
baseline trained on the full season. These results demonstrate that leveraging
temperature data not only improves predictive performance across seasons but
also enhances the robustness and trustworthiness of crop-type mapping in
real-world applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have attracted significant interest
for their ability to model complex signals by mapping spatial and temporal
coordinates to signal values. In the context of neural video representation,
several decoding strategies have been explored to balance compactness and
reconstruction quality, including pixel-wise, frame-wise, and patch-wise
methods. Patch-wise decoding aims to combine the flexibility of pixel-based
models with the efficiency of frame-based approaches. However, conventional
uniform patch division often leads to discontinuities at patch boundaries, as
independently reconstructed regions may fail to form a coherent global
structure. To address this limitation, we propose a neural video representation
method based on Structure-Preserving Patches (SPPs). Our approach rearranges
each frame into a set of spatially structured patch frames using a
PixelUnshuffle-like operation. This rearrangement maintains the spatial
coherence of the original frame while enabling patch-level decoding. The
network learns to predict these rearranged patch frames, which supports a
global-to-local fitting strategy and mitigates degradation caused by
upsampling. Experiments on standard video datasets show that the proposed
method improves reconstruction quality and compression performance compared to
existing INR-based video representation methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose an adaptive sampling framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
that leverages comprehensive multi-view photometric error signals within a
unified Metropolis-Hastings approach. Traditional 3DGS methods heavily rely on
heuristic-based density-control mechanisms (e.g., cloning, splitting, and
pruning), which can lead to redundant computations or the premature removal of
beneficial Gaussians. Our framework overcomes these limitations by
reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process,
dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view
errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from
these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance
on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian
distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on
benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep
Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed,
enhancing computational efficiency while matching or modestly surpassing the
view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BAVT is a new method for segmenting blood vessels in coronary angiograms, combining Vision Transformers with edge-aware loss to improve boundary detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of vascular structures in coronary angiography is crucial but challenging due to vessels being long, thin, and low-contrast. Traditional CNNs struggle with topological continuity, and ViT models lack precise boundary awareness.

Method: BAVT is a Vision Transformer-based architecture with an edge-aware loss function that focuses on fine-grained vascular boundaries. It maintains a minimal, scalable structure compatible with large-scale vision foundation model pretraining.

Result: BAVT outperformed CNN and hybrid models on the DCA-1 dataset in medical image segmentation metrics, showing better performance in vascular segmentation.

Conclusion: Combining plain ViT encoders with boundary-aware supervision is effective for achieving clinical-grade vascular segmentation, suggesting potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vascular structures in coronary angiography remains
a core challenge in medical image analysis due to the complexity of elongated,
thin, and low-contrast vessels. Classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
often fail to preserve topological continuity, while recent Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based models, although strong in global context modeling, lack precise
boundary awareness. In this work, we introduce BAVT, a Boundary-Aware Vision
Transformer, a ViT-based architecture enhanced with an edge-aware loss that
explicitly guides the segmentation toward fine-grained vascular boundaries.
Unlike hybrid transformer-CNN models, BAVT retains a minimal, scalable
structure that is fully compatible with large-scale vision foundation model
(VFM) pretraining. We validate our approach on the DCA-1 coronary angiography
dataset, where BAVT achieves superior performance across medical image
segmentation metrics outperforming both CNN and hybrid baselines. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining plain ViT encoders with
boundary-aware supervision for clinical-grade vascular segmentation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of transformers in medical applications, the
exploration of multi-scale learning through transformers remains limited, while
hierarchical representations are considered advantageous for computer-aided
medical diagnosis. We propose a novel hierarchical transformer model that
adeptly integrates the feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) with the advanced representational potential of Vision
Transformers (ViTs). Addressing the lack of inductive biases and dependence on
extensive training datasets in ViTs, our model employs a CNN backbone to
generate hierarchical visual representations. These representations are adapted
for transformer input through an innovative patch tokenization process,
preserving the inherited multi-scale inductive biases. We also introduce a
scale-wise attention mechanism that directly captures intra-scale and
inter-scale associations. This mechanism complements patch-wise attention by
enhancing spatial understanding and preserving global perception, which we
refer to as local and global attention, respectively. Our model significantly
outperforms baseline models in terms of classification accuracy, demonstrating
its efficiency in bridging the gap between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
and Vision Transformers (ViTs). The components are designed as plug-and-play
for different CNN architectures and can be adapted for multiple applications.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security
by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD
benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios,
neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge
this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark
specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the
capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed
benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized
according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as
Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously
annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further
investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art
closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results
reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video
anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that
achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy. The benchmark

Motivation: Current transformer-based models for multi-person pose estimation (MPPE) are not real-time, limiting their applicability in computer vision and virtual reality tasks.

Method: The authors propose a family of transformer-based models with a modified decoder architecture and keypoint similarity metrics to generate positive and negative queries, improving query selection quality.

Result: The proposed models train 5-10 times faster, have competitive inference times without needing quantization libraries, and achieve competitive results with significantly fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their transformer-based approach enables real-time MPPE with improved efficiency and performance, making it suitable for practical applications in computer vision and virtual reality.

Abstract: Multi-person pose estimation (MPPE) estimates keypoints for all individuals
present in an image. MPPE is a fundamental task for several applications in
computer vision and virtual reality. Unfortunately, there are currently no
transformer-based models that can perform MPPE in real time. The paper presents
a family of transformer-based models capable of performing multi-person 2D pose
estimation in real-time. Our approach utilizes a modified decoder architecture
and keypoint similarity metrics to generate both positive and negative queries,
thereby enhancing the quality of the selected queries within the architecture.
Compared to state-of-the-art models, our proposed models train much faster,
using 5 to 10 times fewer epochs, with competitive inference times without
requiring quantization libraries to speed up the model. Furthermore, our
proposed models provide competitive results or outperform alternative models,
often using significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite recent advances in sparse novel view synthesis (NVS) applied to
object-centric scenes, scene-level NVS remains a challenge. A central issue is
the lack of available clean multi-view training data, beyond manually curated
datasets with limited diversity, camera variation, or licensing issues. On the
other hand, an abundance of diverse and permissively-licensed data exists in
the wild, consisting of scenes with varying appearances (illuminations,
transient occlusions, etc.) from sources such as tourist photos. To this end,
we present WildCAT3D, a framework for generating novel views of scenes learned
from diverse 2D scene image data captured in the wild. We unlock training on
these data sources by explicitly modeling global appearance conditions in
images, extending the state-of-the-art multi-view diffusion paradigm to learn
from scene views of varying appearances. Our trained model generalizes to new
scenes at inference time, enabling the generation of multiple consistent novel
views. WildCAT3D provides state-of-the-art results on single-view NVS in
object- and scene-level settings, while training on strictly less data sources
than prior methods. Additionally, it enables novel applications by providing
global appearance control during generation.

Abstract: Driven by the rapid progress in vision-language models (VLMs), the
responsible behavior of large-scale multimodal models has become a prominent
research area, particularly focusing on hallucination detection and factuality
checking. In this paper, we present the solution for the two tracks of
Responsible AI challenge. Inspirations from the general domain demonstrate that
a smaller distilled VLM can often outperform a larger VLM that is directly
tuned on downstream tasks, while achieving higher efficiency. We thus jointly
tackle two tasks from the perspective of knowledge distillation and propose a
progressive hybrid knowledge distillation framework termed HKD4VLM.
Specifically, the overall framework can be decomposed into Pyramid-like
Progressive Online Distillation and Ternary-Coupled Refinement Distillation,
hierarchically moving from coarse-grained knowledge alignment to fine-grained
refinement. Besides, we further introduce the mapping shift-enhanced inference
and diverse augmentation strategies to enhance model performance and
robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
HKD4VLM. Ablation studies provide insights into the critical design choices
driving performance gains.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) has evolved from handcrafted feature-based
methods to deep learning approaches and, more recently, to models incorporating
large language models (LLMs). Early methods struggled with variations in
lighting, pose, and viewpoint, but deep learning addressed these issues by
learning robust visual features. Building on this, LLMs now enable ReID systems
to integrate semantic and contextual information through natural language. This
survey traces that full evolution and offers one of the first comprehensive
reviews of ReID approaches that leverage LLMs, where textual descriptions are
used as privileged information to improve visual matching. A key contribution
is the use of dynamic, identity-specific prompts generated by GPT-4o, which
enhance the alignment between images and text in vision-language ReID systems.
Experimental results show that these descriptions improve accuracy, especially
in complex or ambiguous cases. To support further research, we release a large
set of GPT-4o-generated descriptions for standard ReID datasets. By bridging
computer vision and natural language processing, this survey offers a unified
perspective on the field's development and outlines key future directions such
as better prompt design, cross-modal transfer learning, and real-world
adaptability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present MAMMA, a markerless motion-capture pipeline that accurately
recovers SMPL-X parameters from multi-view video of two-person interaction
sequences. Traditional motion-capture systems rely on physical markers.
Although they offer high accuracy, their requirements of specialized hardware,
manual marker placement, and extensive post-processing make them costly and
time-consuming. Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome these
limitations, but most are designed for single-person capture, rely on sparse
keypoints, or struggle with occlusions and physical interactions. In this work,
we introduce a method that predicts dense 2D surface landmarks conditioned on
segmentation masks, enabling person-specific correspondence estimation even
under heavy occlusion. We employ a novel architecture that exploits learnable
queries for each landmark. We demonstrate that our approach can handle complex
person--person interaction and offers greater accuracy than existing methods.
To train our network, we construct a large, synthetic multi-view dataset
combining human motions from diverse sources, including extreme poses, hand
motions, and close interactions. Our dataset yields high-variability synthetic
sequences with rich body contact and occlusion, and includes SMPL-X
ground-truth annotations with dense 2D landmarks. The result is a system
capable of capturing human motion without the need for markers. Our approach
offers competitive reconstruction quality compared to commercial marker-based
motion-capture solutions, without the extensive manual cleanup. Finally, we
address the absence of common benchmarks for dense-landmark prediction and
markerless motion capture by introducing two evaluation settings built from
real multi-view sequences. We will release our dataset, benchmark, method,
training code, and pre-trained model weights for research purposes.

Abstract: Chest radiography is widely used in diagnostic imaging. However, perceptual
errors -- especially overlooked but visible abnormalities -- remain common and
clinically significant. Current workflows and AI systems provide limited
support for detecting such errors after interpretation and often lack
meaningful human--AI collaboration. We introduce RADAR (Radiologist--AI
Diagnostic Assistance and Review), a post-interpretation companion system.
RADAR ingests finalized radiologist annotations and CXR images, then performs
regional-level analysis to detect and refer potentially missed abnormal
regions. The system supports a "second-look" workflow and offers suggested
regions of interest (ROIs) rather than fixed labels to accommodate
inter-observer variation. We evaluated RADAR on a simulated perceptual-error
dataset derived from de-identified CXR cases, using F1 score and Intersection
over Union (IoU) as primary metrics. RADAR achieved a recall of 0.78, precision
of 0.44, and an F1 score of 0.56 in detecting missed abnormalities in the
simulated perceptual-error dataset. Although precision is moderate, this
reduces over-reliance on AI by encouraging radiologist oversight in human--AI
collaboration. The median IoU was 0.78, with more than 90% of referrals
exceeding 0.5 IoU, indicating accurate regional localization. RADAR effectively
complements radiologist judgment, providing valuable post-read support for
perceptual-error detection in CXR interpretation. Its flexible ROI suggestions
and non-intrusive integration position it as a promising tool in real-world
radiology workflows. To facilitate reproducibility and further evaluation, we
release a fully open-source web implementation alongside a simulated error
dataset. All code, data, demonstration videos, and the application are publicly

interpolation and extrapolation. The Compositional-Exclusion benchmark omits
all samples of a specific chemical composition, probing generalization across
stoichiometries. Nine vision--language foundation models are prompted with
crystallographic images and textual context to generate structural annotations.
Responses are evaluated via (i) relative errors in lattice parameters and
density, (ii) a physics-consistency index penalizing volumetric violations, and
(iii) a hallucination score capturing geometric outliers and invalid
space-group predictions. These benchmarks establish a reproducible, physically
informed framework for assessing generalization, consistency, and reliability

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success in
visual generation. While, they suffer from slow inference speed due to
iterative sampling. Employing fewer sampling steps is an intuitive solution,
but this will also introduces discretization error. Existing fast samplers make
inspiring efforts to reduce discretization error through the adoption of
high-order solvers, potentially reaching a plateau in terms of optimization.
This raises the question: can the sampling process be accelerated further? In
this paper, we re-examine the nature of sampling errors, discerning that they
comprise two distinct elements: the widely recognized discretization error and
the less explored approximation error. Our research elucidates the dynamics
between these errors and the step by implementing a dual-error disentanglement
strategy. Building on these foundations, we introduce an unified and
training-free acceleration framework, DualFast, designed to enhance the speed
of DPM sampling by concurrently accounting for both error types, thereby
minimizing the total sampling error. DualFast is seamlessly compatible with
existing samplers and significantly boost their sampling quality and speed,
particularly in extremely few sampling steps. We substantiate the effectiveness
of our framework through comprehensive experiments, spanning both unconditional
and conditional sampling domains, across both pixel-space and latent-space
DPMs.

Abstract: Recent pathology foundation models can provide rich tile-level

without further extensive model development. These models lack whole-slide
image (WSI) understanding and are not trained with large-scale diagnostic data,
limiting their performance on diverse downstream tasks. We introduce PRISM2, a
multi-modal slide-level foundation model trained via clinical dialogue to
enable scalable, generalizable pathology AI. PRISM2 is trained on nearly
700,000 specimens (2.3 million WSIs) paired with real-world clinical diagnostic
reports in a two-stage process. In Stage 1, a vision-language model is trained
using contrastive and captioning objectives to align whole slide embeddings
with textual clinical diagnosis. In Stage 2, the language model is unfrozen to
enable diagnostic conversation and extract more clinically meaningful
representations from hidden states. PRISM2 achieves strong performance on
diagnostic and biomarker prediction tasks, outperforming prior slide-level
models including PRISM and TITAN. It also introduces a zero-shot yes/no
classification approach that surpasses CLIP-style methods without prompt tuning
or class enumeration. By aligning visual features with clinical reasoning,
PRISM2 improves generalization on both data-rich and low-sample tasks, offering
a scalable path forward for building general pathology AI agents capable of

Abstract: Video Individual Counting (VIC) is a recently introduced task that aims to
estimate pedestrian flux from a video. It extends conventional Video Crowd
Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that
only learns to count repeated pedestrian patterns across frames, the key
problem of VIC is how to identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which
turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however,
mainly follow a one-to-one (O2O) matching strategy where the same pedestrian
must be exactly matched between frames, leading to sensitivity to appearance
variations or missing detections. In this work, we show that the O2O matching
could be relaxed to a one-to-many (O2M) matching problem, which better fits the
problem nature of VIC and can leverage the social grouping behavior of walking
pedestrians. We therefore introduce OMAN, a simple but effective VIC model with
implicit One-to-Many mAtchiNg, featuring an implicit context generator and a
one-to-many pairwise matcher. Experiments on the SenseCrowd and CroHD
benchmarks show that OMAN achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Code is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent visual place recognition (VPR) approaches have leveraged foundation
models (FM) and introduced novel aggregation techniques. However, these methods
have failed to fully exploit key concepts of FM, such as the effective
utilization of extensive training sets, and they have overlooked the potential
of classical aggregation methods, such as GeM and NetVLAD. Building on these
insights, we revive classical feature aggregation methods and develop more
fundamental VPR models, collectively termed SuperPlace. First, we introduce a
supervised label alignment method that enables training across various VPR
datasets within a unified framework. Second, we propose G$^2$M, a compact
feature aggregation method utilizing two GeMs, where one GeM learns the
principal components of feature maps along the channel dimension and calibrates
the output of the other. Third, we propose the secondary fine-tuning (FT$^2$)
strategy for NetVLAD-Linear (NVL). NetVLAD first learns feature vectors in a
high-dimensional space and then compresses them into a lower-dimensional space
via a single linear layer. Extensive experiments highlight our contributions
and demonstrate the superiority of SuperPlace. Specifically, G$^2$M achieves
promising results with only one-tenth of the feature dimensions compared to
recent methods. Moreover, NVL-FT$^2$ ranks first on the MSLS leaderboard.

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) must remain accurate
under extreme viewpoint, scale and illumination variations. The widely adopted
ORB-SLAM3 falters in these regimes because it relies on hand-crafted ORB
keypoints. We introduce SuperPoint-SLAM3, a drop-in upgrade that (i) replaces
ORB with the self-supervised SuperPoint detector--descriptor, (ii) enforces
spatially uniform keypoints via adaptive non-maximal suppression (ANMS), and
(iii) integrates a lightweight NetVLAD place-recognition head for
learning-based loop closure.
  On the KITTI Odometry benchmark SuperPoint-SLAM3 reduces mean translational
error from 4.15% to 0.34% and mean rotational error from 0.0027 deg/m to 0.0010
deg/m. On the EuRoC MAV dataset it roughly halves both errors across every
sequence (e.g., V2\_03: 1.58% -> 0.79%). These gains confirm that fusing modern
deep features with a learned loop-closure module markedly improves ORB-SLAM3
accuracy while preserving its real-time operation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing
temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos,
utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises
due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to
incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we
present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised
Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode
both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and
language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an
anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby
yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory
bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions
associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's
expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates
remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two
benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.

Abstract: Prototype-based reconstruction methods for unsupervised anomaly detection
utilize a limited set of learnable prototypes which only aggregates
insufficient normal information, resulting in undesirable reconstruction.
However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well
reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft
Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these
issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly
detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable
prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we
employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the
normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via
prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more
comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image
features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its
contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive
prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well
reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention
mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within
the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further
improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art
performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness
for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.

Abstract: 3D modeling of highly reflective objects remains challenging due to strong
view-dependent appearances. While previous SDF-based methods can recover
high-quality meshes, they are often time-consuming and tend to produce
over-smoothed surfaces. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers the
advantage of high speed and detailed real-time rendering, but extracting
surfaces from the Gaussians can be noisy due to the lack of geometric
constraints. To bridge the gap between these approaches, we propose a novel
reconstruction method called GS-2DGS for reflective objects based on 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). Our approach combines the rapid rendering
capabilities of Gaussian Splatting with additional geometric information from
foundation models. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms Gaussian-based techniques
in terms of reconstruction and relighting and achieves performance comparable
to SDF-based methods while being an order of magnitude faster. Code is

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often generate hallucinations, where

can take diverse forms, detecting hallucinations at a fine-grained level is
essential for comprehensive evaluation and analysis. To this end, we propose a
novel task of multimodal fine-grained hallucination detection and editing for
MLLMs. Moreover, we propose ZINA, a novel method that identifies hallucinated
spans at a fine-grained level, classifies their error types into six
categories, and suggests appropriate refinements. To train and evaluate models
for this task, we constructed VisionHall, a dataset comprising 6.9k outputs
from twelve MLLMs manually annotated by 211 annotators, and 20k synthetic
samples generated using a graph-based method that captures dependencies among
error types. We demonstrated that ZINA outperformed existing methods, including
GPT-4o and LLama-3.2, in both detection and editing tasks.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a scene-oriented image retrieval problem in
computer vision in which re-ranking based on local features is commonly
employed to improve performance. In robotics, VPR is also referred to as Loop
Closure Detection, which emphasizes spatial-temporal verification within a
sequence. However, designing local features specifically for VPR is
impractical, and relying on motion sequences imposes limitations. Inspired by
these observations, we propose a novel, simple re-ranking method that refines
global features through a Mixture-of-Features (MoF) approach under embodied
constraints. First, we analyze the practical feasibility of embodied
constraints in VPR and categorize them according to existing datasets, which
include GPS tags, sequential timestamps, local feature matching, and
self-similarity matrices. We then propose a learning-based MoF
weight-computation approach, utilizing a multi-metric loss function.
Experiments demonstrate that our method improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on public datasets with minimal additional computational overhead.
For instance, with only 25 KB of additional parameters and a processing time of
10 microseconds per frame, our method achieves a 0.9\% improvement over a
DINOv2-based baseline performance on the Pitts-30k test set.

Abstract: The generation of temporally consistent, high-fidelity driving videos over
extended horizons presents a fundamental challenge in autonomous driving world
modeling. Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature
misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and
limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these
limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine),
a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature
coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To
achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce
Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training
strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout
the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process
separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage
training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model
decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby
accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on
the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing
methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also
explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We
generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset,
which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.

Abstract: Sign language transition generation seeks to convert discrete sign language
segments into continuous sign videos by synthesizing smooth transitions.
However,most existing methods merely concatenate isolated signs, resulting in
poor visual coherence and semantic accuracy in the generated videos. Unlike
textual languages,sign language is inherently rich in spatial-temporal cues,
making it more complex to model. To address this,we propose StgcDiff, a
graph-based conditional diffusion framework that generates smooth transitions
between discrete signs by capturing the unique spatial-temporal dependencies of
sign language. Specifically, we first train an encoder-decoder architecture to
learn a structure-aware representation of spatial-temporal skeleton sequences.
Next, we optimize a diffusion denoiser conditioned on the representations
learned by the pre-trained encoder, which is tasked with predicting transition
frames from noise. Additionally, we design the Sign-GCN module as the key
component in our framework, which effectively models the spatial-temporal
features. Extensive experiments conducted on the PHOENIX14T, USTC-CSL100,and
USTC-SLR500 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Abstract: Although Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in image understanding tasks, their computational efficiency
remains a significant challenge, particularly on resource-constrained devices
due to the high cost of processing large numbers of visual tokens. Recently,
training-free visual token pruning methods have gained popularity as a low-cost
solution to this issue. However, existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: semantic saliency-based strategies primarily focus on high
cross-attention visual tokens, often neglecting visual diversity, whereas
visual diversity-based methods risk inadvertently discarding semantically
important tokens, especially under high compression ratios. In this paper, we
introduce GreedyPrune, a training-free plug-and-play visual token pruning
algorithm designed to jointly optimize semantic saliency and visual diversity.
We formalize the token pruning process as a combinatorial optimization problem
and demonstrate that greedy algorithms effectively balance computational
efficiency with model accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing that GreedyPrune achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy across various multimodal tasks and models while
significantly reducing end-to-end inference latency.

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision
and robotics. Most existing learning-based PCR methods rely on Transformers,
which suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This limitation restricts
the resolution of point clouds that can be processed, inevitably leading to
information loss. In contrast, Mamba-a recently proposed model based on state
space models (SSMs)-achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining
strong long-range contextual modeling capabilities. However, directly applying
Mamba to PCR tasks yields suboptimal performance due to the unordered and
irregular nature of point cloud data. To address this challenge, we propose
MT-PCR, the first point cloud registration framework that integrates both Mamba
and Transformer modules. Specifically, we serialize point cloud features using
Z-order space-filling curves to enforce spatial locality, enabling Mamba to
better model the geometric structure of the input. Additionally, we remove the
order indicator module commonly used in Mamba-based sequence modeling, leads to
improved performance in our setting. The serialized features are then processed
by an optimized Mamba encoder, followed by a Transformer refinement stage.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MT-PCR
outperforms Transformer-based and concurrent state-of-the-art methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, significantly reducing while GPU memory usage and
FLOPs.

Additionally, this work explores diverse data sources such as digital elevation

in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model

survey concludes by suggesting future directions to address these limitations,
focusing on enhanced datasets, improved models, and policy implications for

Abstract: Recently, patch deformation-based methods have demonstrated significant
effectiveness in multi-view stereo due to their incorporation of deformable and
expandable perception for reconstructing textureless areas. However, these
methods generally focus on identifying reliable pixel correlations to mitigate
matching ambiguity of patch deformation, while neglecting the deformation
instability caused by edge-skipping and visibility occlusions, which may cause
potential estimation deviations. To address these issues, we propose DVP-MVS++,
an innovative approach that synergizes both depth-normal-edge aligned and
harmonized cross-view priors for robust and visibility-aware patch deformation.
Specifically, to avoid edge-skipping, we first apply DepthPro, Metric3Dv2 and
Roberts operator to generate coarse depth maps, normal maps and edge maps,
respectively. These maps are then aligned via an erosion-dilation strategy to
produce fine-grained homogeneous boundaries for facilitating robust patch
deformation. Moreover, we reformulate view selection weights as visibility
maps, and then implement both an enhanced cross-view depth reprojection and an
area-maximization strategy to help reliably restore visible areas and
effectively balance deformed patch, thus acquiring harmonized cross-view priors
for visibility-aware patch deformation. Additionally, we obtain geometry
consistency by adopting both aggregated normals via view selection and
projection depth differences via epipolar lines, and then employ SHIQ for
highlight correction to enable geometry consistency with highlight-aware
perception, thus improving reconstruction quality during propagation and
refinement stage. Evaluation results on ETH3D, Tanks & Temples and Strecha
datasets exhibit the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization
capability of our proposed method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have greatly enhanced 3D object
recognition, but most models are limited to closed-set scenarios, unable to
handle unknown samples in real-world applications. Open-set recognition (OSR)
addresses this limitation by enabling models to both classify known classes and
identify novel classes. However, current OSR methods rely on global features to
differentiate known and unknown classes, treating the entire object uniformly
and overlooking the varying semantic importance of its different parts. To
address this gap, we propose Salience-Aware Structured Separation (SASep),
which includes (i) a tunable semantic decomposition (TSD) module to
semantically decompose objects into important and unimportant parts, (ii) a
geometric synthesis strategy (GSS) to generate pseudo-unknown objects by
combining these unimportant parts, and (iii) a synth-aided margin separation
(SMS) module to enhance feature-level separation by expanding the feature
distributions between classes. Together, these components improve both
geometric and feature representations, enhancing the model's ability to
effectively distinguish known and unknown classes. Experimental results show
that SASep achieves superior performance in 3D OSR, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: World models are critical for autonomous driving to simulate environmental

ego-vehicle motion (perspective shifts) from scene evolvement (agent
interactions), leading to suboptimal predictions. Instead, we propose to
separate environmental changes from ego-motion by leveraging the scene-centric
coordinate systems. In this paper, we introduce COME: a framework that
integrates scene-centric forecasting Control into the Occupancy world ModEl.
Specifically, COME first generates ego-irrelevant, spatially consistent future
features through a scene-centric prediction branch, which are then converted
into scene condition using a tailored ControlNet. These condition features are
subsequently injected into the occupancy world model, enabling more accurate
and controllable future occupancy predictions. Experimental results on the
nuScenes-Occ3D dataset show that COME achieves consistent and significant
improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across diverse
configurations, including different input sources (ground-truth, camera-based,
fusion-based occupancy) and prediction horizons (3s and 8s). For example, under
the same settings, COME achieves 26.3% better mIoU metric than DOME and 23.7%
better mIoU metric than UniScene. These results highlight the efficacy of
disentangled representation learning in enhancing spatio-temporal prediction
fidelity for world models. Code and videos will be available at

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter

open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based
evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture
incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty
estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center
prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and
segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate
between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss
functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown
regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference
in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale.
Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level.
To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and
introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR
panoptic segmentation methods.

Motivation: Recycling steel scrap reduces CO2 emissions, but impurities hinder effective recycling. Current methods may not handle niche objects well, necessitating a more accurate anomaly detection system.

Method: A vision-language model is finetuned with a multiclass classification setup, utilizing a multi-scale image encoder and text prompts that align with both normal and anomaly images to detect fine-grained impurities.

Conclusion: Finetuning a vision-language model with multi-scale mechanisms and aligned text prompts enhances anomaly detection in steel scrap recycling, offering a promising solution to improve recycling efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

Abstract: Recycling steel scrap can reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the

scrap. Specifically, we finetune the image encoder, equipped with multi-scale

finetuning process trains these modules using a multiclass classification as
the supervision.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate intraoperative X-ray/CT registration is essential for
surgical navigation in orthopedic procedures. However, existing methods
struggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under
broad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work
aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT
registration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed
registration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest
point (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone
contours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on
matching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone
substructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in
a more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only
two X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute
a dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image
poses and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method
is evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The
method consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm
compared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention.
Furthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully
automatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient
solution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which
can be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration
accuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative
navigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in
computer-assisted surgery (CAS).

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have
enabled the generation of high-quality and photorealistic images from text
descriptions. However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender,
race, and socioeconomic status, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes and
shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation
methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement,
where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes)
unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target
attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this
challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that
accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, Asian, and
Indian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background details)
during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target
attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected
layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of
target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms
existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes,
thereby maintaining the output distribution and generation capability of the
original model.

Abstract: Traditional point-based image editing methods rely on iterative latent
optimization or geometric transformations, which are either inefficient in
their processing or fail to capture the semantic relationships within the
image. These methods often overlook the powerful yet underutilized image
editing capabilities inherent in pre-trained diffusion models. In this work, we
propose a novel one-step point-based image editing method, named AttentionDrag,
which leverages the inherent latent knowledge and feature correlations within
pre-trained diffusion models for image editing tasks. This framework enables
semantic consistency and high-quality manipulation without the need for
extensive re-optimization or retraining. Specifically, we reutilize the latent
correlations knowledge learned by the self-attention mechanism in the U-Net
module during the DDIM inversion process to automatically identify and adjust
relevant image regions, ensuring semantic validity and consistency.
Additionally, AttentionDrag adaptively generates masks to guide the editing
process, enabling precise and context-aware modifications with friendly
interaction. Our results demonstrate a performance that surpasses most
state-of-the-art methods with significantly faster speeds, showing a more
efficient and semantically coherent solution for point-based image editing
tasks.

Abstract: This work investigates the adaptation of large pre-trained latent diffusion
models to a radically new imaging domain: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). While
these generative models, originally trained on natural images, demonstrate
impressive capabilities in text-to-image synthesis, they are not natively
adapted to represent SAR data, which involves different physics, statistical
distributions, and visual characteristics. Using a sizeable SAR dataset (on the
order of 100,000 to 1 million images), we address the fundamental question of
fine-tuning such models for this unseen modality. We explore and compare
multiple fine-tuning strategies, including full model fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient approaches like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), focusing
separately on the UNet diffusion backbone and the text encoder components. To
evaluate generative quality, we combine several metrics: statistical distance
from real SAR distributions, textural similarity via GLCM descriptors, and
semantic alignment assessed with a CLIP model fine-tuned on SAR data. Our
results show that a hybrid tuning strategy yields the best performance: full
fine-tuning of the UNet is better at capturing low-level SAR-specific patterns,
while LoRA-based partial tuning of the text encoder, combined with embedding
learning of the <SAR> token, suffices to preserve prompt alignment. This work
provides a methodical strategy for adapting foundation models to unconventional
imaging modalities beyond natural image domains.

Abstract: We introduce the task of Audible Action Temporal Localization, which aims to
identify the spatio-temporal coordinates of audible movements. Unlike
conventional tasks such as action recognition and temporal action localization,
which broadly analyze video content, our task focuses on the distinct kinematic
dynamics of audible actions. It is based on the premise that key actions are
driven by inflectional movements; for example, collisions that produce sound
often involve abrupt changes in motion. To capture this, we propose
$TA^{2}Net$, a novel architecture that estimates inflectional flow using the
second derivative of motion to determine collision timings without relying on
audio input. $TA^{2}Net$ also integrates a self-supervised spatial localization
strategy during training, combining contrastive learning with spatial analysis.
This dual design improves temporal localization accuracy and simultaneously
identifies sound sources within video frames. To support this task, we
introduce a new benchmark dataset, $Audible623$, derived from Kinetics and
UCF101 by removing non-essential vocalization subsets. Extensive experiments
confirm the effectiveness of our approach on $Audible623$ and show strong
generalizability to other domains, such as repetitive counting and sound source
localization. Code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for few-shot action recognition that uses task-specific cues to identify reliable modalities and improve performance through active inference and mutual distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current few-shot action recognition methods rely on single-modal data, limiting their ability to leverage multimodal information effectively.

Method: The framework includes an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module using active inference with posterior distributions to identify reliable modalities and an active mutual distillation module for knowledge transfer between modalities.

Result: The method shows significant improvement over existing approaches in multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances few-shot action recognition by leveraging multimodal information through active inference and adaptive weighting during meta-test.

Abstract: Owing to its rapid progress and broad application prospects, few-shot action
recognition has attracted considerable interest. However, current methods are
predominantly based on limited single-modal data, which does not fully exploit
the potential of multimodal information. This paper presents a novel framework
that actively identifies reliable modalities for each sample using
task-specific contextual cues, thus significantly improving recognition
performance. Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module,
which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on
posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike
reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based
preferences, making more stable predictions. Additionally, we introduce an
active mutual distillation module that enhances the representation learning of
less reliable modalities by transferring knowledge from more reliable ones.
Adaptive multimodal inference is employed during the meta-test to assign higher
weights to reliable modalities. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches.

Abstract: Data visualization generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown

specialized Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based critic to evaluate and
provide feedback for LLM-generated data visualizations. At the core of our
approach is a framework to construct a high-quality visualization critique
dataset, where we collect human-created visualization instances, synthesize
corresponding LLM-generated instances, and construct high-quality critiques. We
conduct both model-based automatic evaluation and human preference studies to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our experiments show that even
small (7B parameters) open-source MLLM models achieve substantial performance
gains by leveraging our high-quality visualization critique dataset, reaching
levels comparable to much larger open-source or even proprietary models. Our

Abstract: Multi-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology has gained
increasing attention in agriculture, offering unique capabilities for
monitoring vegetation dynamics thanks to its all-weather, day-and-night
operation and high revisit frequency. This study presents, for the first time,
a comprehensive analysis combining dual-polarimetric radar vegetation index
(DpRVI) with optical indices to characterize vineyard crops. Vineyards exhibit
distinct non-isotropic scattering behavior due to their pronounced row
orientation, making them particularly challenging and interesting targets for
remote sensing. The research further investigates the relationship between
DpRVI and optical vegetation indices, demonstrating the complementary nature of
their information. We demonstrate that DpRVI and optical indices provide
complementary information, with low correlation suggesting that they capture
distinct vineyard features. Key findings reveal a parabolic trend in DpRVI over
the growing season, potentially linked to biomass dynamics estimated via the
Winkler Index. Unlike optical indices reflecting vegetation greenness, DpRVI
appears more directly related to biomass growth, aligning with specific
phenological phases. Preliminary results also highlight the potential of DpRVI
for distinguishing vineyards from other crops. This research aligns with the
objectives of the PNRR-NODES project, which promotes nature-based solutions
(NbS) for sustainable vineyard management. The application of DpRVI for
monitoring vineyards is part of integrating remote sensing techniques into the
broader field of strategies for climate-related change adaptation and risk
reduction, emphasizing the role of innovative SAR-based monitoring in
sustainable agriculture.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Grapevine varieties are essential for the economies of many wine-producing
countries, influencing the production of wine, juice, and the consumption of
fruits and leaves. Traditional identification methods, such as ampelography and
molecular analysis, have limitations: ampelography depends on expert knowledge
and is inherently subjective, while molecular methods are costly and
time-intensive. To address these limitations, recent studies have applied deep
learning (DL) models to classify grapevine varieties using image data. However,
due to the small dataset sizes, these methods often depend on transfer learning
from datasets from other domains, e.g., ImageNet1K (IN1K), which can lead to
performance degradation due to domain shift and supervision collapse. In this
context, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods can be a good tool to avoid
this performance degradation, since they can learn directly from data, without
external labels. This study presents an evaluation of Masked Autoencoders
(MAEs) for identifying grapevine varieties based on field-acquired images. The
main contributions of this study include two benchmarks comprising 43 grapevine
varieties collected across different seasons, an analysis of MAE's application
in the agricultural context, and a performance comparison of trained models
across seasons. Our results show that a ViT-B/16 model pre-trained with MAE and
the unlabeled dataset achieved an F1 score of 0.7956, outperforming all other
models. Additionally, we observed that pre-trained models benefit from long
pre-training, perform well under low-data training regime, and that simple data
augmentation methods are more effective than complex ones. The study also found
that the mask ratio in MAE impacts performance only marginally.

Abstract: Video face restoration faces a critical challenge in maintaining temporal
consistency while recovering fine facial details from degraded inputs. This
paper presents a novel approach that extends Vector-Quantized Variational
Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), pretrained on static high-quality portraits, into a
video restoration framework through variational latent space modeling. Our key
innovation lies in reformulating discrete codebook representations as
Dirichlet-distributed continuous variables, enabling probabilistic transitions
between facial features across frames. A spatio-temporal Transformer
architecture jointly models inter-frame dependencies and predicts latent
distributions, while a Laplacian-constrained reconstruction loss combined with
perceptual (LPIPS) regularization enhances both pixel accuracy and visual
quality. Comprehensive evaluations on blind face restoration, video inpainting,
and facial colorization tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. This
work establishes an effective paradigm for adapting intensive image priors,
pretrained on high-quality images, to video restoration while addressing the
critical challenge of flicker artifacts. The source code has been open-sourced

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work presents a generalizable framework to transfer relative depth to
metric depth. Current monocular depth estimation methods are mainly divided
into metric depth estimation (MMDE) and relative depth estimation (MRDE). MMDEs
estimate depth in metric scale but are often limited to a specific domain.
MRDEs generalize well across different domains, but with uncertain scales which
hinders downstream applications. To this end, we aim to build up a framework to
solve scale uncertainty and transfer relative depth to metric depth. Previous
methods used language as input and estimated two factors for conducting
rescaling. Our approach, TR2M, utilizes both text description and image as
inputs and estimates two rescale maps to transfer relative depth to metric
depth at pixel level. Features from two modalities are fused with a
cross-modality attention module to better capture scale information. A strategy
is designed to construct and filter confident pseudo metric depth for more
comprehensive supervision. We also develop scale-oriented contrastive learning
to utilize depth distribution as guidance to enforce the model learning about
intrinsic knowledge aligning with the scale distribution. TR2M only exploits a
small number of trainable parameters to train on datasets in various domains
and experiments not only demonstrate TR2M's great performance in seen datasets
but also reveal superior zero-shot capabilities on five unseen datasets. We
show the huge potential in pixel-wise transferring relative depth to metric
depth with language assistance. (Code is available at:

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in imaging inverse problems
owing to their powerful generative capabilities. However, existing approaches
typically rely on models trained for specific degradation types, limiting their
generalizability to various degradation scenarios. To address this limitation,
we propose a zero-shot framework capable of handling various imaging inverse
problems without model retraining. We introduce a likelihood-guided noise
refinement mechanism that derives a closed-form approximation of the likelihood
score, simplifying score estimation and avoiding expensive gradient
computations. This estimated score is subsequently utilized to refine the
model-predicted noise, thereby better aligning the restoration process with the
generative framework of diffusion models. In addition, we integrate the
Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) sampling strategy to further improve
inference efficiency. The proposed mechanism can be applied to both
optimization-based and sampling-based schemes, providing an effective and
flexible zero-shot solution for imaging inverse problems. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
inverse problems, particularly in compressive sensing, delivering high-quality
reconstructions even at an extremely low sampling rate (5%).

Abstract: Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of

that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate
remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust
uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies
systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can
be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on
an established Dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two
new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly,
our models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a
bucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years. While not intended for
clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting
medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available

Abstract: Leveraging the high temporal resolution and dynamic range, object detection

robotics applications in real-world scenarios. However, processing sparse event
data requires compute-intensive convolutional recurrent units, complicating
their integration into resource-constrained edge applications. Here, we propose
the Sparse Event-based Efficient Detector (SEED) for efficient event-based
object detection on neuromorphic processors. We introduce sparse convolutional
recurrent learning, which achieves over 92% activation sparsity in recurrent
processing, vastly reducing the cost for spatiotemporal reasoning on sparse
event data. We validated our method on Prophesee's 1 Mpx and Gen1 event-based
object detection datasets. Notably, SEED sets a new benchmark in computational
efficiency for event-based object detection which requires long-term temporal
learning. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, SEED significantly reduces
synaptic operations while delivering higher or same-level mAP. Our hardware
simulations showcase the critical role of SEED's hardware-aware design in
achieving energy-efficient and low-latency neuromorphic processing.

Abstract: Depth map enhancement using paired high-resolution RGB images offers a
cost-effective solution for improving low-resolution depth data from

pipeline to fuse the two modalities requires groundtruth depth maps for
supervision. To address this, we propose a self-supervised learning framework,
SelfToF, which generates detailed and scale-aware depth maps. Starting from an
image-based self-supervised depth estimation pipeline, we add low-resolution
depth as inputs, design a new depth consistency loss, propose a scale-recovery
module, and finally obtain a large performance boost. Furthermore, since the
ToF signal sparsity varies in real-world applications, we upgrade SelfToF to
SelfToF* with submanifold convolution and guided feature fusion. Consequently,
SelfToF* maintain robust performance across varying sparsity levels in ToF
data. Overall, our proposed method is both efficient and effective, as verified
by extensive experiments on the NYU and ScanNet datasets. The code will be made

Abstract: Facial age estimation has achieved considerable success under controlled

when faces are partially occluded, which may obscure their visibility. To
address this limitation, we propose a new approach integrating generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and transformer architectures to enable robust age
estimation from occluded faces. We employ an SN-Patch GAN to effectively remove
occlusions, while an Attentive Residual Convolution Module (ARCM), paired with
a Swin Transformer, enhances feature representation. Additionally, we introduce
a Multi-Task Age Head (MTAH) that combines regression and distribution
learning, further improving age estimation under occlusion. Experimental
results on the FG-NET, UTKFace, and MORPH datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques for occluded
facial age estimation by achieving an MAE of $3.00$, $4.54$, and $2.53$ years,
respectively.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a core task in computer vision that involves
detecting objects in video frames and associating them across time. The rise of
deep learning has significantly advanced MOT, particularly within the
tracking-by-detection paradigm, which remains the dominant approach.
Advancements in modern deep learning-based methods accelerated in 2022 with the
introduction of ByteTrack for tracking-by-detection and MOTR for end-to-end
tracking. Our survey provides an in-depth analysis of deep learning-based MOT
methods, systematically categorizing tracking-by-detection approaches into five
groups: joint detection and embedding, heuristic-based, motion-based, affinity
learning, and offline methods. In addition, we examine end-to-end tracking
methods and compare them with existing alternative approaches. We evaluate the
performance of recent trackers across multiple benchmarks and specifically
assess their generality by comparing results across different domains. Our
findings indicate that heuristic-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results
on densely populated datasets with linear object motion, while deep
learning-based association methods, in both tracking-by-detection and
end-to-end approaches, excel in scenarios with complex motion patterns.

Abstract: Photorealistic style transfer (PST) enables real-world color grading by
adapting reference image colors while preserving content structure. Existing
methods mainly follow either approaches: generation-based methods that
prioritize stylistic fidelity at the cost of content integrity and efficiency,
or global color transformation methods such as LUT, which preserve structure
but lack local adaptability. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatial Adaptive 4D
Look-Up Table (SA-LUT), combining LUT efficiency with neural network
adaptability. SA-LUT features: (1) a Style-guided 4D LUT Generator that
extracts multi-scale features from the style image to predict a 4D LUT, and (2)
a Context Generator using content-style cross-attention to produce a context
map. This context map enables spatially-adaptive adjustments, allowing our 4D
LUT to apply precise color transformations while preserving structural
integrity. To establish a rigorous evaluation framework for photorealistic
style transfer, we introduce PST50, the first benchmark specifically designed
for PST assessment. Experiments demonstrate that SA-LUT substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 66.7% reduction in LPIPS
score compared to 3D LUT approaches, while maintaining real-time performance at

Conclusion: The conclusion states that ESRPCB effectively enhances defect detection in small PCB images through super-resolution and ensemble learning.

Abstract: Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are critical components in modern electronics,
which require stringent quality control to ensure proper functionality.
However, the detection of defects in small-scale PCBs images poses significant
challenges as a result of the low resolution of the captured images, leading to
potential confusion between defects and noise. To overcome these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel framework, named ESRPCB (edgeguided
super-resolution for PCBs defect detection), which combines edgeguided
super-resolution with ensemble learning to enhance PCBs defect detection. The
framework leverages the edge information to guide the EDSR (Enhanced Deep
Super-Resolution) model with a novel ResCat (Residual Concatenation) structure,
enabling it to reconstruct high-resolution images from small PCBs inputs. By
incorporating edge features, the super-resolution process preserves critical
structural details, ensuring that tiny defects remain distinguishable in the
enhanced image. Following this, a multi-modal defect detection model employs
ensemble learning to analyze the super-resolved

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for generating realistic abundance
maps from hyperspectral imagery using an unsupervised, deep-learning-driven
approach. Our framework integrates blind linear hyperspectral unmixing with
state-of-the-art diffusion models to enhance the realism and diversity of
synthetic abundance maps. First, we apply blind unmixing to extract endmembers
and abundance maps directly from raw hyperspectral data. These abundance maps
then serve as inputs to a diffusion model, which acts as a generative engine to
synthesize highly realistic spatial distributions. Diffusion models have
recently revolutionized image synthesis by offering superior performance,
flexibility, and stability, making them well-suited for high-dimensional
spectral data. By leveraging this combination of physically interpretable
unmixing and deep generative modeling, our approach enables the simulation of
hyperspectral sensor outputs under diverse imaging conditions--critical for
data augmentation, algorithm benchmarking, and model evaluation in
hyperspectral analysis. Notably, our method is entirely unsupervised, ensuring
adaptability to different datasets without the need for labeled training data.
We validate our approach using real hyperspectral imagery from the PRISMA space
mission for Earth observation, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing
realistic synthetic abundance maps that capture the spatial and spectral
characteristics of natural scenes.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Diagram Synthesis has been a crucial task in computer
graphics, with applications ranging from educational tools to AI-driven
mathematical reasoning. Traditionally, we rely on computer tools (e.g.,
Matplotlib and GeoGebra) to manually generate precise diagrams, but it usually
requires huge, complicated calculations cost. Recently, researchers start to
work on learning-based methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion and GPT4) to
automatically generate diagrams, saving operational cost but usually suffering
from limited realism and insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework GeoSDF to automatically generate diagrams efficiently and
accurately with Signed Distance Field (SDF). Specifically, we first represent
geometric elements in the SDF, then construct a series of constraint functions
to represent geometric relationships, next we optimize such constraint
functions to get an optimized field of both elements and constraints, finally
by rendering the optimized field, we can obtain the synthesized diagram. In our
GeoSDF, we define a symbolic language to easily represent geometric elements
and those constraints, and our synthesized geometry diagrams can be
self-verified in the SDF, ensuring both mathematical accuracy and visual
plausibility. In experiments, our GeoSDF synthesized both normal high-school
level and IMO-level geometry diagrams. Through both qualitative and
quantitative analysis, we can see that synthesized diagrams are realistic and
accurate, and our synthesizing process is simple and efficient. Furthermore, we
obtain a very high accuracy of solving geometry problems (over 95\% while the
current SOTA accuracy is around 75%) by leveraging our self-verification
property. All of these demonstrate the advantage of GeoSDF, paving the way for
more sophisticated, accurate, and flexible generation of geometric diagrams for
a wide array of applications.

Abstract: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's
innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections
and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information
retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their
technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient
fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents'
hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International
Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing")
into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent
designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive
loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the
retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent
image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical
taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models
on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the
retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models,
which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments
with limited hardware.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Overlapping object perception aims to decouple the randomly overlapping
foreground-background features, extracting foreground features while
suppressing background features, which holds significant application value in
fields such as security screening and medical auxiliary diagnosis. Despite some
research efforts to tackle the challenge of overlapping object perception, most
solutions are confined to the spatial domain. Through frequency domain
analysis, we observe that the degradation of contours and textures due to the
overlapping phenomenon can be intuitively reflected in the magnitude spectrum.
Based on this observation, we propose a general Frequency-Optimized
Anti-Overlapping Framework (FOAM) to assist the model in extracting more
texture and contour information, thereby enhancing the ability for
anti-overlapping object perception. Specifically, we design the Frequency
Spatial Transformer Block (FSTB), which can simultaneously extract features
from both the frequency and spatial domains, helping the network capture more
texture features from the foreground. In addition, we introduce the
Hierarchical De-Corrupting (HDC) mechanism, which aligns adjacent features in
the separately constructed base branch and corruption branch using a specially
designed consistent loss during the training phase. This mechanism suppresses
the response to irrelevant background features of FSTBs, thereby improving the
perception of foreground contour. We conduct extensive experiments to validate
the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed FOAM, which further
improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on four datasets, specifically
for the three overlapping object perception tasks: Prohibited Item Detection,
Prohibited Item Segmentation, and Pneumonia Detection. The code will be open
source once the paper is accepted.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the complex psychophysics of visual stabilization in the human eye, highlighting that even with constant microsaccades, stable perception of the environment is maintained through specific retinal signal operations, and proposes both functional and speculative neural mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how the human visual system maintains stable perception despite constant eye movements, which is more complex than simple mechanical stabilization or evolutionary assumptions.

Method: The method involves a series of experiments over a dozen years to study the psychophysics of visual stabilization.

Result: The experiments revealed that visual stabilization is more nuanced than previously thought, suggesting specific operations on retinal signals leading to stable perception.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that there is a likely functional mechanism for visual stabilization and a speculative proposal of neural circuits that could implement it.

Abstract: Even during fixation the human eye is constantly in low amplitude motion,
jittering over small angles in random directions at up to 100Hz. This motion
results in all features of the image on the retina constantly traversing a
number of cones, yet objects which are stable in the world are perceived to be
stable, and any object which is moving in the world is perceived to be moving.
A series of experiments carried out over a dozen years revealed the
psychophysics of visual stabilization to be more nuanced than might be assumed,
say, from the mechanics of stabilization of camera images, or what might be
assumed to be the simplest solution from an evolutionary perspective. The
psychophysics revealed by the experiments strongly implies a specific set of
operations on retinal signals resulting in the observed stabilization behavior.
The presentation is in two levels. First is a functional description of the
action of the mechanism that is very likely responsible for the experimentally
observed behavior. Second is a more speculative proposal of circuit-level
neural elements that might implement the functional behavior.

Abstract: Recent methods, such as 2D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields,
have aimed to address the geometric inaccuracies of 3D Gaussian Splatting while
retaining its superior rendering quality. However, these approaches still
struggle to reconstruct smooth and reliable geometry, particularly in scenes
with significant color variation across viewpoints, due to their per-point
appearance modeling and single-view optimization constraints. In this paper, we
propose an effective multiview geometric regularization strategy that
integrates multiview stereo (MVS) depth, RGB, and normal constraints into
Gaussian Splatting initialization and optimization. Our key insight is the
complementary relationship between MVS-derived depth points and Gaussian
Splatting-optimized positions: MVS robustly estimates geometry in regions of
high color variation through local patch-based matching and epipolar
constraints, whereas Gaussian Splatting provides more reliable and less noisy
depth estimates near object boundaries and regions with lower color variation.
To leverage this insight, we introduce a median depth-based multiview relative
depth loss with uncertainty estimation, effectively integrating MVS depth
information into Gaussian Splatting optimization. We also propose an MVS-guided
Gaussian Splatting initialization to avoid Gaussians falling into suboptimal
positions. Extensive experiments validate that our approach successfully
combines these strengths, enhancing both geometric accuracy and rendering
quality across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Performance evaluation for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) remains a
crucial but unsolved problem today especially in the medical domain. Various
evaluation metrics have been discussed in the literature to solve this problem.
Most of the existing metrics (e.g., precision, recall) are adapted from
classification tasks which require manual labels as ground truth. However, such
labels are often expensive and unavailable in specific thematic domains.
Furthermore, medical images are usually associated with (radiological) case
reports or annotated with descriptive captions in literature figures, such text
contains information that can help to assess CBIR.Several researchers have
argued that the medical concepts hidden in the text can serve as the basis for
CBIR evaluation purpose. However, these works often consider these medical
concepts as independent and isolated labels while in fact the subtle
relationships between various concepts are neglected. In this work, we
introduce the use of knowledge graphs to measure the distance between various
medical concepts and propose a novel relevance measure for the evaluation of
CBIR by defining an approximate matching-based relevance score between two sets
of medical concepts which allows us to indirectly measure the similarity
between medical images.We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness and
feasibility of our relevance measure using a public dataset.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from unconstrained image collections poses
significant challenges due to variations in appearance. In this paper, we
propose Scalable Micro-macro Wavelet-based Gaussian Splatting (SMW-GS), a novel
method that enhances 3D reconstruction across diverse scales by decomposing
scene representations into global, refined, and intrinsic components. SMW-GS
incorporates the following innovations: Micro-macro Projection, which enables
Gaussian points to sample multi-scale details with improved diversity; and
Wavelet-based Sampling, which refines feature representations using
frequency-domain information to better capture complex scene appearances. To
achieve scalability, we further propose a large-scale scene promotion strategy,
which optimally assigns camera views to scene partitions by maximizing their
contributions to Gaussian points, achieving consistent and high-quality
reconstructions even in expansive environments. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SMW-GS significantly outperforms existing methods in both
reconstruction quality and scalability, particularly excelling in large-scale
urban environments with challenging illumination variations. Project is

TL;DR: Atomizer is a flexible remote sensing image architecture that uses atomic representations with contextual metadata and structured tokenization to enable generalization across modalities without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing models that require retraining for new remote sensing data configurations, thereby improving their generalizability.

Method: Atomizer represents images as sets of scalars with contextual metadata, uses structured tokenization with Fourier features and non-uniform radial basis functions, and employs cross-attention to map tokens into a latent space.

Result: Atomizer outperforms standard models in modality-disjoint evaluations and shows robust performance across different resolutions and spatial sizes.

Conclusion: Atomizer provides a flexible and generalizable approach for processing diverse remote sensing data without the need for retraining when new configurations are introduced.

Abstract: The growing number of Earth observation satellites has led to increasingly
diverse remote sensing data, with varying spatial, spectral, and temporal
configurations. Most existing models rely on fixed input formats and
modality-specific encoders, which require retraining when new configurations
are introduced, limiting their ability to generalize across modalities. We
introduce Atomizer, a flexible architecture that represents remote sensing
images as sets of scalars, each corresponding to a spectral band value of a
pixel. Each scalar is enriched with contextual metadata (acquisition time,
spatial resolution, wavelength, and bandwidth), producing an atomic
representation that allows a single encoder to process arbitrary modalities
without interpolation or resampling. Atomizer uses structured tokenization with
Fourier features and non-uniform radial basis functions to encode content and
context, and maps tokens into a latent space via cross-attention. Under
modality-disjoint evaluations, Atomizer outperforms standard models and
demonstrates robust performance across varying resolutions and spatial sizes.

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in clinical radiotherapy for image-guided
treatment, improving setup accuracy, adaptive planning, and motion management.
However, slow gantry rotation limits performance by introducing motion
artifacts, blurring, and increased dose. This work aims to develop a clinically
feasible method for reconstructing high-quality CBCT volumes from consecutive
limited-angle acquisitions, addressing imaging challenges in time- or
dose-constrained settings. We propose a limited-angle (LA) geometry-integrated
cycle-domain (LA-GICD) framework for CBCT reconstruction, comprising two
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) connected via analytic
cone-beam forward and back projectors. A Projection-DDPM completes missing
projections, followed by back-projection, and an Image-DDPM refines the volume.
This dual-domain design leverages complementary priors from projection and
image spaces to achieve high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle (<= 90
degrees) scans. Performance was evaluated against full-angle reconstruction.
Four board-certified medical physicists conducted assessments. A total of 78
planning CTs in common CBCT geometries were used for training and evaluation.
The method achieved a mean absolute error of 35.5 HU, SSIM of 0.84, and PSNR of
29.8 dB, with visibly reduced artifacts and improved soft-tissue clarity.
LA-GICD's geometry-aware dual-domain learning, embedded in analytic
forward/backward operators, enabled artifact-free, high-contrast
reconstructions from a single 90-degree scan, reducing acquisition time and
dose four-fold. LA-GICD improves limited-angle CBCT reconstruction with strong
data fidelity and anatomical realism. It offers a practical solution for
short-arc acquisitions, enhancing CBCT use in radiotherapy by providing
clinically applicable images with reduced scan time and dose for more accurate,
personalized treatments.

Abstract: Accurate road topology reasoning is critical for autonomous driving, enabling
effective navigation and adherence to traffic regulations. Central to this task
are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically
focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often
\textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or
\textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches
either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the
inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational
modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally
leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their
connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both
perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding.
Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our
geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane
representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced
topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T
head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning
strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive
experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3
in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new

Abstract: Diffusion models are advancing autonomous driving by enabling realistic data
synthesis, predictive end-to-end planning, and closed-loop simulation, with a
primary focus on temporally consistent generation. However, the generation of
large-scale 3D scenes that require spatial coherence remains underexplored. In
this paper, we propose X-Scene, a novel framework for large-scale driving scene
generation that achieves both geometric intricacy and appearance fidelity,
while offering flexible controllability. Specifically, X-Scene supports
multi-granular control, including low-level conditions such as user-provided or
text-driven layout for detailed scene composition and high-level semantic
guidance such as user-intent and LLM-enriched text prompts for efficient
customization. To enhance geometrical and visual fidelity, we introduce a
unified pipeline that sequentially generates 3D semantic occupancy and the
corresponding multiview images, while ensuring alignment between modalities.
Additionally, we extend the generated local region into a large-scale scene
through consistency-aware scene outpainting, which extrapolates new occupancy
and images conditioned on the previously generated area, enhancing spatial
continuity and preserving visual coherence. The resulting scenes are lifted
into high-quality 3DGS representations, supporting diverse applications such as
scene exploration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that X-Scene
significantly advances controllability and fidelity for large-scale driving
scene generation, empowering data generation and simulation for autonomous
driving.

that dynamically adapts retrieval granularity based on query complexity using a
lightweight intent classifier. Our framework employs an Omni-Knowledge Indexing
module to build hierarchical databases from text (captions, ASR, OCR), visual
features, and semantic graphs, enabling optimal resource allocation across
tasks. We also introduce the HiVU benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Distilling pre-trained 2D diffusion models into 3D assets has driven
remarkable advances in text-to-3D synthesis. However, existing methods
typically rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, which involves
asymmetric KL divergence--a formulation that inherently favors mode-seeking
behavior and limits generation diversity. In this paper, we introduce Dive3D, a
novel text-to-3D generation framework that replaces KL-based objectives with
Score Implicit Matching (SIM) loss, a score-based objective that effectively
mitigates mode collapse. Furthermore, Dive3D integrates both diffusion
distillation and reward-guided optimization under a unified divergence
perspective. Such reformulation, together with SIM loss, yields significantly
more diverse 3D outputs while improving text alignment, human preference, and
overall visual fidelity. We validate Dive3D across various 2D-to-3D prompts and
find that it consistently outperforms prior methods in qualitative assessments,
including diversity, photorealism, and aesthetic appeal. We further evaluate
its performance on the GPTEval3D benchmark, comparing against nine
state-of-the-art baselines. Dive3D also achieves strong results on quantitative
metrics, including text-asset alignment, 3D plausibility, text-geometry
consistency, texture quality, and geometric detail.

Abstract: Semantic querying in complex 3D scenes through free-form language presents a
significant challenge. Existing 3D scene understanding methods use large-scale
training data and CLIP to align text queries with 3D semantic features.
However, their reliance on predefined vocabulary priors from training data
hinders free-form semantic querying. Besides, recent advanced methods rely on
LLMs for scene understanding but lack comprehensive 3D scene-level information
and often overlook the potential inconsistencies in LLM-generated outputs. In
our paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a
semantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to
encode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without
predefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels,
which accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a
complete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their
relations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or
predefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate
semantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged
superpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency. To enable free-form semantic
querying, we then design an LLM-based reasoning algorithm that combines
scene-level and object-level information to intricate reasoning. We conducted
extensive experiments on 3D semantic grounding, segmentation, and complex
querying tasks, while also validating the accuracy of graph generation.
Experiments on 6 datasets show that our model excels in both complex free-form
semantic queries and intricate relational reasoning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Model editing aims to efficiently update a pre-trained model's knowledge
without the need for time-consuming full retraining. While existing pioneering
editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing
single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models
(VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality
on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we
explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find
that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at
different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both
modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of
compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we
propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at
their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within
the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update
new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate
DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating
its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted
LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Ego-R1, a novel framework for reasoning over ultra-long (i.e.,
in days and weeks) egocentric videos, which leverages a structured
Chain-of-Tool-Thought (CoTT) process, orchestrated by an Ego-R1 Agent trained
via reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by human problem-solving strategies,
CoTT decomposes complex reasoning into modular steps, with the RL agent
invoking specific tools, one per step, to iteratively and collaboratively
answer sub-questions tackling such tasks as temporal retrieval and multi-modal
understanding. We design a two-stage training paradigm involving supervised
finetuning (SFT) of a pretrained language model using CoTT data and RL to
enable our agent to dynamically propose step-by-step tools for long-range
reasoning. To facilitate training, we construct a dataset called Ego-R1 Data,
which consists of Ego-CoTT-25K for SFT and Ego-QA-4.4K for RL. Furthermore, our
Ego-R1 agent is evaluated on a newly curated week-long video QA benchmark,
Ego-R1 Bench, which contains human-verified QA pairs from hybrid sources.
Extensive results demonstrate that the dynamic, tool-augmented chain-of-thought
reasoning by our Ego-R1 Agent can effectively tackle the unique challenges of
understanding ultra-long egocentric videos, significantly extending the time
coverage from few hours to a week.

Abstract: We introduce the Lecture Video Visual Objects (LVVO) dataset, a new benchmark
for visual object detection in educational video content. The dataset consists
of 4,000 frames extracted from 245 lecture videos spanning biology, computer
science, and geosciences. A subset of 1,000 frames, referred to as LVVO_1k, has
been manually annotated with bounding boxes for four visual categories: Table,
Chart-Graph, Photographic-image, and Visual-illustration. Each frame was
labeled independently by two annotators, resulting in an inter-annotator F1
score of 83.41%, indicating strong agreement. To ensure high-quality consensus
annotations, a third expert reviewed and resolved all cases of disagreement
through a conflict resolution process. To expand the dataset, a semi-supervised
approach was employed to automatically annotate the remaining 3,000 frames,
forming LVVO_3k. The complete dataset offers a valuable resource for developing
and evaluating both supervised and semi-supervised methods for visual content
detection in educational videos. The LVVO dataset is publicly available to
support further research in this domain.

Abstract: The quality of the video dataset (image quality, resolution, and fine-grained
caption) greatly influences the performance of the video generation model. The
growing demand for video applications sets higher requirements for high-quality
video generation models. For example, the generation of movie-level Ultra-High
Definition (UHD) videos and the creation of 4K short video content. However,
the existing public datasets cannot support related research and applications.
In this paper, we first propose a high-quality open-sourced UHD-4K (22.4\% of
which are 8K) text-to-video dataset named UltraVideo, which contains a wide
range of topics (more than 100 kinds), and each video has 9 structured captions
with one summarized caption (average of 824 words). Specifically, we carefully
design a highly automated curation process with four stages to obtain the final
high-quality dataset: \textit{i)} collection of diverse and high-quality video
clips. \textit{ii)} statistical data filtering. \textit{iii)} model-based data
purification. \textit{iv)} generation of comprehensive, structured captions. In
addition, we expand Wan to UltraWan-1K/-4K, which can natively generate
high-quality 1K/4K videos with more consistent text controllability,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our data curation.We believe that this work
can make a significant contribution to future research on UHD video generation.

TL;DR: Vid-CamEdit is a new method for editing video camera paths, using geometry to make realistic videos even when the camera moves a lot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the problem of re-synthesizing monocular videos along user-defined camera paths, which is hard because of limited data and extreme movements.

Method: It has two steps: first, estimate consistent geometry over time, then use that geometry to guide realistic rendering. They use geometric priors and separate training for spatial and temporal parts.

Result: The method works better than others, making more believable videos from new camera paths, especially when moving a lot in real footage.

Conclusion: Vid-CamEdit is effective for video camera editing without needing lots of 4D data, using geometry to improve results in tricky situations.

Abstract: We introduce Vid-CamEdit, a novel framework for video camera trajectory
editing, enabling the re-synthesis of monocular videos along user-defined
camera paths. This task is challenging due to its ill-posed nature and the
limited multi-view video data for training. Traditional reconstruction methods
struggle with extreme trajectory changes, and existing generative models for
dynamic novel view synthesis cannot handle in-the-wild videos. Our approach
consists of two steps: estimating temporally consistent geometry, and
generative rendering guided by this geometry. By integrating geometric priors,
the generative model focuses on synthesizing realistic details where the
estimated geometry is uncertain. We eliminate the need for extensive 4D
training data through a factorized fine-tuning framework that separately trains
spatial and temporal components using multi-view image and video data. Our
method outperforms baselines in producing plausible videos from novel camera
trajectories, especially in extreme extrapolation scenarios on real-world
footage.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Event cameras are gaining traction in traffic monitoring applications due to
their low latency, high temporal resolution, and energy efficiency, which makes
them well-suited for real-time object detection at traffic intersections.
However, the development of robust event-based detection models is hindered by
the limited availability of annotated real-world datasets. To address this,
several simulation tools have been developed to generate synthetic event data.
Among these, the CARLA driving simulator includes a built-in dynamic vision
sensor (DVS) module that emulates event camera output. Despite its potential,
the sim-to-real gap for event-based object detection remains insufficiently
studied. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of this gap by
training a recurrent vision transformer model exclusively on synthetic data
generated using CARLAs DVS and testing it on varying combinations of synthetic
and real-world event streams. Our experiments show that models trained solely
on synthetic data perform well on synthetic-heavy test sets but suffer
significant performance degradation as the proportion of real-world data
increases. In contrast, models trained on real-world data demonstrate stronger
generalization across domains. This study offers the first quantifiable
analysis of the sim-to-real gap in event-based object detection using CARLAs
DVS. Our findings highlight limitations in current DVS simulation fidelity and
underscore the need for improved domain adaptation techniques in neuromorphic
vision for traffic monitoring.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transductive zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify unseen categories by
leveraging both semantic class descriptions and the distribution of unlabeled
test data. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel at aligning
visual inputs with textual semantics, they often rely too heavily on
class-level priors and fail to capture fine-grained visual cues. In contrast,
Vision-only Foundation Models (VFMs) like DINOv2 provide rich perceptual
features but lack semantic alignment. To exploit the complementary strengths of
these models, we propose OTFusion, a simple yet effective training-free
framework that bridges VLMs and VFMs via Optimal Transport. Specifically,
OTFusion aims to learn a shared probabilistic representation that aligns visual
and semantic information by minimizing the transport cost between their
respective distributions. This unified distribution enables coherent class
predictions that are both semantically meaningful and visually grounded.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that OTFusion
consistently outperforms the original CLIP model, achieving an average accuracy
improvement of nearly $10\%$, all without any fine-tuning or additional
annotations. The code will be publicly released after the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Dense matching methods like DUSt3R regress pairwise pointmaps for 3D
reconstruction. However, the reliance on pairwise prediction and the limited
generalization capability inherently restrict the global geometric consistency.
In this work, we introduce Test3R, a surprisingly simple test-time learning
technique that significantly boosts geometric accuracy. Using image triplets
($I_1,I_2,I_3$), Test3R generates reconstructions from pairs ($I_1,I_2$) and
($I_1,I_3$). The core idea is to optimize the network at test time via a
self-supervised objective: maximizing the geometric consistency between these
two reconstructions relative to the common image $I_1$. This ensures the model
produces cross-pair consistent outputs, regardless of the inputs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our technique significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods on the 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth
estimation tasks. Moreover, it is universally applicable and nearly cost-free,
making it easily applied to other models and implemented with minimal test-time
training overhead and parameter footprint. Code is available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise
for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning
capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically
infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long
reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies
reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model
for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and
trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions.
We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling
direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised
fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking
(trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning).
To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a
reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive
experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including
nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of
AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results
showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA
in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Reconstructing an animatable 3D human from casually captured images of an
articulated subject without camera or human pose information is a practical yet
challenging task due to view misalignment, occlusions, and the absence of
structural priors. While optimization-based methods can produce high-fidelity
results from monocular or multi-view videos, they require accurate pose
estimation and slow iterative optimization, limiting scalability in
unconstrained scenarios. Recent feed-forward approaches enable efficient
single-image reconstruction but struggle to effectively leverage multiple input
images to reduce ambiguity and improve reconstruction accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose PF-LHM, a large human reconstruction model that
generates high-quality 3D avatars in seconds from one or multiple casually
captured pose-free images. Our approach introduces an efficient Encoder-Decoder
Point-Image Transformer architecture, which fuses hierarchical geometric point
features and multi-view image features through multimodal attention. The fused
features are decoded to recover detailed geometry and appearance, represented
using 3D Gaussian splats. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method unifies single- and multi-image 3D human
reconstruction, achieving high-fidelity and animatable 3D human avatars without
requiring camera and human pose annotations. Code and models will be released
to the public.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The era of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for
interpretability--agentic interpretability: a multi-turn conversation with an
LLM wherein the LLM proactively assists human understanding by developing and
leveraging a mental model of the user, which in turn enables humans to develop
better mental models of the LLM. Such conversation is a new capability that
traditional `inspective' interpretability methods (opening the black-box) do
not use. Having a language model that aims to teach and explain--beyond just
knowing how to talk--is similar to a teacher whose goal is to teach well,
understanding that their success will be measured by the student's
comprehension. While agentic interpretability may trade off completeness for
interactivity, making it less suitable for high-stakes safety situations with
potentially deceptive models, it leverages a cooperative model to discover
potentially superhuman concepts that can improve humans' mental model of
machines. Agentic interpretability introduces challenges, particularly in
evaluation, due to what we call `human-entangled-in-the-loop' nature (humans
responses are integral part of the algorithm), making the design and evaluation
difficult. We discuss possible solutions and proxy goals. As LLMs approach
human parity in many tasks, agentic interpretability's promise is to help
humans learn the potentially superhuman concepts of the LLMs, rather than see
us fall increasingly far from understanding them.

Abstract: In the past, the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics relied
heavily on trial-and-error experimentation and extensive in vivo testing, often
requiring years of pre-clinical and clinical trials. Today, artificial
intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) are actively transforming vaccine and
immunotherapeutic design, by (i) offering predictive frameworks that support
rapid, data-driven decision-making; (ii) increasingly being implemented as
time- and resource-efficient strategies that integrate computational models,
systems vaccinology, and multi-omics data to better phenotype, differentiate,
and classify patient diseases and cancers; predict patients' immune responses;
and identify the factors contributing to optimal vaccine and immunotherapeutic
protective efficacy; (iii) refining the selection of B- and T-cell
antigen/epitope targets to enhance efficacy and durability of immune
protection; and (iv) enabling a deeper understanding of immune regulation,
immune evasion, immune checkpoints, and regulatory pathways. The future of AI
and DL points toward (i) replacing animal preclinical testing of drugs,
vaccines, and immunotherapeutics with computational-based models, as recently
proposed by the United States FDA; and (ii) enabling real-time in vivo modeling
for immunobridging and prediction of protection in clinical trials. This may
result in a fast and transformative shift for the development of personal
vaccines and immunotherapeutics against infectious pathogens and cancers.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: LLM-assisted hardware verification is gaining substantial attention due to
its potential to significantly reduce the cost and effort of crafting effective
testbenches. It also serves as a critical enabler for LLM-aided end-to-end
hardware language design. However, existing current LLMs often struggle with
Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation, resulting in testbenches that
exhibit functional errors in Hardware Description Languages (HDL) logic.
Motivated by the strong performance of LLMs in Python code generation under
inference-time sampling strategies, and their promising capabilities as judge
agents, we propose PRO-V a fully program generation multi-agent system for
robust RTL verification. Pro-V incorporates an efficient best-of-n iterative
sampling strategy to enhance the correctness of generated testbenches.
Moreover, it introduces an LLM-as-a-judge aid validation framework featuring an
automated prompt generation pipeline. By converting rule-based static analysis
from the compiler into natural language through in-context learning, this
pipeline enables LLMs to assist the compiler in determining whether
verification failures stem from errors in the RTL design or the testbench.
PRO-V attains a verification accuracy of 87.17% on golden RTL implementations
and 76.28% on RTL mutants. Our code is open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of context ambiguity in privacy assessments for language models, which is crucial for appropriate information disclosure.

Method: The method involves identifying context ambiguity as a barrier, designing Camber for context disambiguation, and analyzing model-generated rationales to improve decisions.

Result: The results show up to 13.3% improvement in precision and 22.3% in recall, along with reduced prompt sensitivity through systematic context disambiguation.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that context disambiguation approaches are promising for enhancing agentic privacy reasoning in language models.

Abstract: We study the ability of language models to reason about appropriate
information disclosure - a central aspect of the evolving field of agentic
privacy. Whereas previous works have focused on evaluating a model's ability to
align with human decisions, we examine the role of ambiguity and missing
context on model performance when making information-sharing decisions. We
identify context ambiguity as a crucial barrier for high performance in privacy
assessments. By designing Camber, a framework for context disambiguation, we
show that model-generated decision rationales can reveal ambiguities and that
systematically disambiguating context based on these rationales leads to
significant accuracy improvements (up to 13.3\% in precision and up to 22.3\%
in recall) as well as reductions in prompt sensitivity. Overall, our results
indicate that approaches for context disambiguation are a promising way forward
to enhance agentic privacy reasoning.

Abstract: The relationship between humans and artificial intelligence is no longer
science fiction -- it's a growing reality reshaping how we live and work. AI
has moved beyond research labs into everyday life, powering customer service
chats, personalizing travel, aiding doctors in diagnosis, and supporting
educators. What makes this moment particularly compelling is AI's increasing
collaborative nature. Rather than replacing humans, AI augments our
capabilities -- automating routine tasks, enhancing decisions with data, and
enabling creativity in fields like design, music, and writing. The future of
work is shifting toward AI agents handling tasks autonomously, with humans as
supervisors, strategists, and ethical stewards. This flips the traditional
model: instead of humans using AI as a tool, intelligent agents will operate
independently within constraints, managing everything from scheduling and
customer service to complex workflows. Humans will guide and fine-tune these
agents to ensure alignment with goals, values, and context.
  This shift offers major benefits -- greater efficiency, faster decisions,
cost savings, and scalability. But it also brings risks: diminished human
oversight, algorithmic bias, security flaws, and a widening skills gap. To
navigate this transition, organizations must rethink roles, invest in
upskilling, embed ethical principles, and promote transparency. This paper
examines the technological and organizational changes needed to enable
responsible adoption of AI-first systems -- where autonomy is balanced with
human intent, oversight, and values.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deterministic Markov Decision Processes (DMDPs) are a mathematical framework
for decision-making where the outcomes and future possible actions are
deterministically determined by the current action taken. DMDPs can be viewed
as a finite directed weighted graph, where in each step, the controller chooses
an outgoing edge. An objective is a measurable function on runs (or infinite
trajectories) of the DMDP, and the value for an objective is the maximal
cumulative reward (or weight) that the controller can guarantee. We consider
the classical mean-payoff (aka limit-average) objective, which is a basic and
fundamental objective.
  Howard's policy iteration algorithm is a popular method for solving DMDPs
with mean-payoff objectives. Although Howard's algorithm performs well in
practice, as experimental studies suggested, the best known upper bound is
exponential and the current known lower bound is as follows: For the input size
$I$, the algorithm requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{I})$ iterations, where
$\tilde{\Omega}$ hides the poly-logarithmic factors, i.e., the current lower
bound on iterations is sub-linear with respect to the input size. Our main
result is an improved lower bound for this fundamental algorithm where we show
that for the input size $I$, the algorithm requires $\tilde{\Omega}(I)$
iterations.

Abstract: Modeling vehicle interactions at unsignalized intersections is a challenging
task due to the complexity of the underlying game-theoretic processes. Although
prior studies have attempted to capture interactive driving behaviors, most
approaches relied solely on game-theoretic formulations and did not leverage
naturalistic driving datasets. In this study, we learn human-like interactive
driving policies at unsignalized intersections using Deep Fictitious Play.
Specifically, we first model vehicle interactions as a Differential Game, which
is then reformulated as a Potential Differential Game. The weights in the cost
function are learned from the dataset and capture diverse driving styles. We
also demonstrate that our framework provides a theoretical guarantee of
convergence to a Nash equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to train interactive driving policies using Deep Fictitious Play.
We validate the effectiveness of our Deep Fictitious Play-Based Potential
Differential Game (DFP-PDG) framework using the INTERACTION dataset. The
results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves satisfactory
performance in learning human-like driving policies. The learned individual
weights effectively capture variations in driver aggressiveness and
preferences. Furthermore, the ablation study highlights the importance of each
component within our model.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely

For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for
evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude
for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance
on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding
tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true
capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving
ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce a diagnostic
task: file path identification from issue descriptions alone, to probe models'
underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on
SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine
problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76%
accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without
access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks
from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data
contamination or memorization. These findings raise concerns about the validity
of existing results and underscore the need for more robust,
contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.

Motivation: The motivation is to address interoperability challenges in hybrid modeling and simulation through the use of ontologies.

Method: The paper uses a combination of competency questions, ontology design patterns, and layered strategies to develop ontologies for hybrid M&S.

Result: The results show that ontologies can serve as both descriptive domain representations and prescriptive guides for simulation construction, with practical benefits in four application cases.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while there are challenges in ontology-based hybrid M&S, there are also significant opportunities for tool integration, semantic alignment, and explainable AI.

Abstract: We explore the role of ontologies in enhancing hybrid modeling and simulation
through improved semantic rigor, model reusability, and interoperability across
systems, disciplines, and tools. By distinguishing between methodological and
referential ontologies, we demonstrate how these complementary approaches
address interoperability challenges along three axes: Human-Human,
Human-Machine, and Machine-Machine. Techniques such as competency questions,
ontology design patterns, and layered strategies are highlighted for promoting
shared understanding and formal precision. Integrating ontologies with Semantic
Web Technologies, we showcase their dual role as descriptive domain
representations and prescriptive guides for simulation construction. Four
application cases - sea-level rise analysis, Industry 4.0 modeling, artificial
societies for policy support, and cyber threat evaluation - illustrate the
practical benefits of ontology-driven hybrid simulation workflows. We conclude
by discussing challenges and opportunities in ontology-based hybrid M&S,
including tool integration, semantic alignment, and support for explainable AI.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Navigating the vast and rapidly growing body of scientific literature is a
formidable challenge for aspiring researchers. Current approaches to supporting
research idea generation often rely on generic large language models (LLMs).
While LLMs are effective at aiding comprehension and summarization, they often
fall short in guiding users toward practical research ideas due to their
limitations. In this study, we present a novel structural framework for
research ideation. Our framework, The Budget AI Researcher, uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided
pairing to recombine concepts from hundreds of machine learning papers. The
system ingests papers from nine major AI conferences, which collectively span
the vast subfields of machine learning, and organizes them into a hierarchical
topic tree. It uses the tree to identify distant topic pairs, generate novel
research abstracts, and refine them through iterative self-evaluation against
relevant literature and peer reviews, generating and refining abstracts that
are both grounded in real-world research and demonstrably interesting.
Experiments using LLM-based metrics indicate that our method significantly
improves the concreteness of generated research ideas relative to standard
prompting approaches. Human evaluations further demonstrate a substantial
enhancement in the perceived interestingness of the outputs. By bridging the
gap between academic data and creative generation, the Budget AI Researcher
offers a practical, free tool for accelerating scientific discovery and
lowering the barrier for aspiring researchers. Beyond research ideation, this
approach inspires solutions to the broader challenge of generating
personalized, context-aware outputs grounded in evolving real-world knowledge.

Abstract: We propose Network Automatic Relevance Determination (NARD), an extension of
ARD for linearly probabilistic models, to simultaneously model sparse
relationships between inputs $X \in \mathbb R^{d \times N}$ and outputs $Y \in
\mathbb R^{m \times N}$, while capturing the correlation structure among the
$Y$. NARD employs a matrix normal prior which contains a sparsity-inducing
parameter to identify and discard irrelevant features, thereby promoting
sparsity in the model. Algorithmically, it iteratively updates both the
precision matrix and the relationship between $Y$ and the refined inputs. To
mitigate the computational inefficiencies of the $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^3)$ cost
per iteration, we introduce Sequential NARD, which evaluates features
sequentially, and a Surrogate Function Method, leveraging an efficient
approximation of the marginal likelihood and simplifying the calculation of
determinant and inverse of an intermediate matrix. Combining the Sequential
update with the Surrogate Function method further reduces computational costs.
The computational complexity per iteration for these three methods is reduced
to $\mathcal O(m^3+p^3)$, $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^2)$, $\mathcal O(m^3+p^2)$,
respectively, where $p \ll d$ is the final number of features in the model. Our
methods demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency with
comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal document retrieval systems enable information access across text,
images, and layouts, benefiting various domains like document-based question
answering, report analysis, and interactive content summarization. Rerankers
improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved candidates. However,
current multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant
room for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness.
Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and
optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal
Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval,
aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal
reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving
instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and
high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data
construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the
RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking
reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward
to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5
achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable
results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the
best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results
validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline.

Method: Arvolution is an AR framework that visualizes ghost policies, creates a taxonomy of DRL maladaptation, allows human disruption, and uses a dual-learning loop with humans and agents.

Result: Arvolution enables intuitive visualization of policy divergence and transforms DRL agent failures into actionable learning resources.

Conclusion: The work paves the way for a new research area called 'Failure Visualization Learning' by making agent failures more transparent and useful for improvement.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents often exhibit intricate failure
modes that are difficult to understand, debug, and learn from. This opacity
hinders their reliable deployment in real-world applications. To address this
critical gap, we introduce ``Ghost Policies,'' a concept materialized through
Arvolution, a novel Augmented Reality (AR) framework. Arvolution renders an
agent's historical failed policy trajectories as semi-transparent ``ghosts''
that coexist spatially and temporally with the active agent, enabling an
intuitive visualization of policy divergence. Arvolution uniquely integrates:
(1) AR visualization of ghost policies, (2) a behavioural taxonomy of DRL
maladaptation, (3) a protocol for systematic human disruption to scientifically
study failure, and (4) a dual-learning loop where both humans and agents learn
from these visualized failures. We propose a paradigm shift, transforming DRL
agent failures from opaque, costly errors into invaluable, actionable learning
resources, laying the groundwork for a new research field: ``Failure
Visualization Learning.''

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Evaluating consistency in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
ensuring reliability, particularly in complex, multi-step interactions between
humans and LLMs. Traditional self-consistency methods often miss subtle
semantic changes in natural language and functional shifts in code or
equations, which can accumulate over multiple transformations. To address this,
we propose ConsistencyChecker, a tree-based evaluation framework designed to
measure consistency through sequences of reversible transformations, including
machine translation tasks and AI-assisted programming tasks. In our framework,
nodes represent distinct text states, while edges correspond to pairs of
inverse operations. Dynamic and LLM-generated benchmarks ensure a fair
assessment of the model's generalization ability and eliminate benchmark
leakage. Consistency is quantified based on similarity across different depths
of the transformation tree. Experiments on eight models from various families
and sizes show that ConsistencyChecker can distinguish the performance of
different models. Notably, our consistency scores-computed entirely without
using WMT paired data-correlate strongly (r > 0.7) with WMT 2024 auto-ranking,
demonstrating the validity of our benchmark-free approach. Our implementation
is available at: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/consistencychecker.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage framework using robust supervised fine-tuning and model merging to update LLMs without losing general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge editing approaches fail in sequential editing and degrade model performance, limiting their practical use.

Method: The method combines R-SFT for fine-tuning the LLM with new knowledge and model merging to retain both new knowledge and original capabilities.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods in sequential editing while maintaining original model performance without architectural changes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables knowledge editing in LLMs without compromising their general capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require continuous updates to maintain accurate
and current knowledge as the world evolves. While existing knowledge editing
approaches offer various solutions for knowledge updating, they often struggle
with sequential editing scenarios and harm the general capabilities of the
model, thereby significantly hampering their practical applicability. This
paper proposes a two-stage framework combining robust supervised fine-tuning
(R-SFT) with model merging for knowledge editing. Our method first fine-tunes
the LLM to internalize new knowledge fully, then merges the fine-tuned model
with the original foundation model to preserve newly acquired knowledge and
general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in sequential editing while better
preserving the original performance of the model, all without requiring any
architectural changes. Code is available at:

Abstract: Travel planning is a complex task requiring the integration of diverse
real-world information and user preferences. While LLMs show promise, existing
methods with long-horizon thinking struggle with handling multifaceted
constraints and preferences in the context, leading to suboptimal itineraries.
We formulate this as an $L^3$ planning problem, emphasizing long context, long
instruction, and long output. To tackle this, we introduce Multiple Aspects of
Planning (MAoP), enabling LLMs to conduct wide-horizon thinking to solve
complex planning problems. Instead of direct planning, MAoP leverages the
strategist to conduct pre-planning from various aspects and provide the
planning blueprint for planning models, enabling strong inference-time
scalability for better performance. In addition, current benchmarks overlook
travel's dynamic nature, where past events impact subsequent journeys, failing
to reflect real-world feasibility. To address this, we propose Travel-Sim, an
agent-based benchmark assessing plans via real-world travel simulation. This
work advances LLM capabilities in complex planning and offers novel insights
for evaluating sophisticated scenarios through agent-based simulation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have emerged as a promising
solution towards ameliorating urban traffic congestion, with Traffic Signal
Control (TSC) identified as a critical component. Although Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms have shown potential in optimizing TSC
through real-time decision-making, their scalability and effectiveness often
suffer from large-scale and complex environments. Typically, these limitations
primarily stem from a fundamental mismatch between the exponential growth of
the state space driven by the environmental heterogeneities and the limited
modeling capacity of current solutions. To address these issues, this paper
introduces a novel MARL framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks
(DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), aiming to enhance the
expressiveness of environmental representations and improve agent coordination.
Furthermore, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in Large
Language Models (LLMs), a topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling
(TSD)-enhanced MoE is proposed, which leverages topological signatures to
decouple graph features for specialized processing, thus improving the model's
ability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous local observations. The TSD
module is also integrated into the policy and value networks of the Multi-agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, further improving
decision-making efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on
real-world traffic scenarios, together with comprehensive theoretical analysis,
validate the superior performance of the proposed framework, highlighting the
model's scalability and effectiveness in addressing the complexities of
large-scale TSC tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the potential shortcomings of current data-driven modeling in healthcare AI, which may lead to negative patient outcomes due to misaligned data use.

Method: The paper reflects on the history of data analysis and explores how systems thinking and clinical domain theory can enhance model development.

Result: The result is a call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that considers both data generation and automation goals.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes that aligning AI models with clinical theory and real-world contexts can lead to more effective and human-centric healthcare automation.

Abstract: In this work, we reflect on the data-driven modeling paradigm that is gaining
ground in AI-driven automation of patient care. We argue that the repurposing
of existing real-world patient datasets for machine learning may not always
represent an optimal approach to model development as it could lead to
undesirable outcomes in patient care. We reflect on the history of data
analysis to explain how the data-driven paradigm rose to popularity, and we
envision ways in which systems thinking and clinical domain theory could
complement the existing model development approaches in reaching human-centric
outcomes. We call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that is
grounded in clinical theory and the sociotechnical realities of real-world
operational contexts. We argue that understanding the utility of existing
patient datasets requires looking in two directions: upstream towards the data
generation, and downstream towards the automation objectives. This
purpose-driven perspective to AI system development opens up new methodological
opportunities and holds promise for AI automation of patient care.

Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the
visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent
evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an
unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a
technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial
intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining
human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous
intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource
consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To
address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary
framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a
particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud
framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,
and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model
inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to
a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling
effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource
constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based
intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging
communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI
models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses
the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced
intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI
services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and
communication systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs), despite their power, can introduce
safety risks in clinical settings due to limitations such as poor error
detection and single point of failure. To address this, we propose Tiered
Agentic Oversight (TAO), a hierarchical multi-agent framework that enhances AI
safety through layered, automated supervision. Inspired by clinical hierarchies
(e.g., nurse, physician, specialist), TAO conducts agent routing based on task
complexity and agent roles. Leveraging automated inter- and intra-tier
collaboration and role-playing, TAO creates a robust safety framework. Ablation
studies reveal that TAO's superior performance is driven by its adaptive tiered
architecture, which improves safety by over 3.2% compared to static single-tier
configurations; the critical role of its lower tiers, particularly tier 1,
whose removal most significantly impacts safety; and the strategic assignment
of more advanced LLM to these initial tiers, which boosts performance by over
2% compared to less optimal allocations while achieving near-peak safety
efficiently. These mechanisms enable TAO to outperform single-agent and
multi-agent frameworks in 4 out of 5 healthcare safety benchmarks, showing up
to an 8.2% improvement over the next-best methods in these evaluations.
Finally, we validate TAO via an auxiliary clinician-in-the-loop study where
integrating expert feedback improved TAO's accuracy in medical triage from 40%
to 60%.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to three types of hallucination:
Input-Conflicting, Context-Conflicting and Fact-Conflicting hallucinations. The
purpose of this study is to mitigate the different types of hallucination by
exploiting the interdependence between them. For this purpose, we propose a
Multi-Information Adapter for Large Language Models (MALM). This framework
employs a tailored multi-graph learning approach designed to elucidate the
interconnections between original inputs, contextual information, and external
factual knowledge, thereby alleviating the three categories of hallucination
within a cohesive framework. Experiments were carried out on four benchmarking
datasets: HaluEval, TruthfulQA, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA. We evaluated
the proposed framework in two aspects: (1) adaptability to different base LLMs
on HaluEval and TruthfulQA, to confirm if MALM is effective when applied on 7
typical LLMs. MALM showed significant improvements over LLaMA-2; (2)
generalizability to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by combining MALM with
three representative retrievers (BM25, Spider and DPR) separately. Furthermore,
automated and human evaluations were conducted to substantiate the correctness
of experimental results, where GPT-4 and 3 human volunteers judged which
response was better between LLaMA-2 and MALM. The results showed that both
GPT-4 and human preferred MALM in 79.4% and 65.6% of cases respectively. The
results validate that incorporating the complex interactions between the three
types of hallucination through a multilayered graph attention network into the
LLM generation process is effective to mitigate the them. The adapter design of
the proposed approach is also proven flexible and robust across different base
LLMs.

Abstract: Children's emotional development fundamentally relies on secure attachment
relationships, yet current AI companions lack the theoretical foundation to
provide developmentally appropriate emotional support. We introduce
DinoCompanion, the first attachment-theory-grounded multimodal robot for
emotionally responsive child-AI interaction. We address three critical
challenges in child-AI systems: the absence of developmentally-informed AI
architectures, the need to balance engagement with safety, and the lack of
standardized evaluation frameworks for attachment-based capabilities. Our
contributions include: (i) a multimodal dataset of 128 caregiver-child dyads
containing 125,382 annotated clips with paired preference-risk labels, (ii)
CARPO (Child-Aware Risk-calibrated Preference Optimization), a novel training
objective that maximizes engagement while applying
epistemic-uncertainty-weighted risk penalties, and (iii) AttachSecure-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering ten attachment-centric competencies
with strong expert consensus (\k{appa}=0.81). DinoCompanion achieves
state-of-the-art performance (57.15%), outperforming GPT-4o (50.29%) and
Claude-3.7-Sonnet (53.43%), with exceptional secure base behaviors (72.99%,
approaching human expert levels of 78.4%) and superior attachment risk
detection (69.73%). Ablations validate the critical importance of multimodal
fusion, uncertainty-aware risk modeling, and hierarchical memory for coherent,

Motivation: To improve the economic efficiency of power systems by developing more accurate and robust solutions for the UC problem, leveraging advancements in machine learning and Lagrangian relaxation methods.

Method: The FunSearch method uses pre-trained large language models combined with evaluators to generate and evolve solutions through a program search process, ensuring their feasibility and optimality.

Result: Simulation experiments with 10 units showed FunSearch outperformed genetic algorithms in sampling time, evaluation time, and total operating cost, indicating its potential as an effective UC solution.

Conclusion: FunSearch is a promising approach for the UC problem, offering improved efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional methods like genetic algorithms, and could be a valuable tool for power system operations.

Abstract: The Unit Commitment (UC) problem is a classic challenge in the optimal
scheduling of power systems. Years of research and practice have shown that
formulating reasonable unit commitment plans can significantly improve the
economic efficiency of power systems' operations. In recent years, with the
introduction of technologies such as machine learning and the Lagrangian
relaxation method, the solution methods for the UC problem have become
increasingly diversified, but still face challenges in terms of accuracy and
robustness. This paper proposes a Function Space Search (FunSearch) method
based on large language models. This method combines pre-trained large language
models and evaluators to creatively generate solutions through the program
search and evolution process while ensuring their rationality. In simulation
experiments, a case of unit commitment with \(10\) units is used mainly.
Compared to the genetic algorithm, the results show that FunSearch performs
better in terms of sampling time, evaluation time, and total operating cost of
the system, demonstrating its great potential as an effective tool for solving
the UC problem.

Abstract: Recent advances in agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. However, most
current methods lack mechanisms for coordinating specialized agents and have
limited ability to generalize to new or diverse domains. We introduce
\projectname, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for general-purpose task
solving that integrates high-level planning with modular agent collaboration.
Inspired by the way a conductor orchestrates a symphony and guided by the
principles of \textit{extensibility}, \textit{multimodality},
\textit{modularity}, and \textit{coordination}, \projectname features a central
planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and delegates sub-tasks to a
team of specialized agents. Each sub-agent is equipped with general programming
and analytical tools, as well as abilities to tackle a wide range of real-world
specific tasks, including data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and
interactive reasoning in dynamic multimodal environments. \projectname supports
flexible orchestration through explicit sub-goal formulation, inter-agent
communication, and adaptive role allocation. We evaluate the framework on three
widely used benchmark datasets covering various real-world tasks, searching web
pages, reasoning over heterogeneous modalities, etc. Experimental results
demonstrate that \projectname consistently outperforms flat-agent and
monolithic baselines in task success rate and adaptability. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of hierarchical organization and role
specialization in building scalable and general-purpose LLM-based agent
systems.

Abstract: Verifying the reliability of complex, multi-step reasoning in Large Language
Models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, as existing methods often lack

Verification (GoV) framework. GoV offers three key contributions: First, it
explicitly models the underlying deductive process as a directed acyclic graph
(DAG), whether this structure is implicit or explicitly constructed. Second, it
enforces a topological order over the DAG to guide stepwise verification.
Third, GoV introduces the notion of customizable node blocks, which flexibly
define the verification granularity, from atomic propositions to full
paragraphs, while ensuring that all requisite premises derived from the graph
are provided as contextual input for each verification unit. We evaluate GoV on
the Number Triangle Summation task and the ProcessBench benchmark with varying
levels of reasoning complexity. Experimental results show that GoV
substantially improves verification accuracy, faithfulness, and error
localization when compared to conventional end-to-end verification approaches.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly simulate human cognition and
behavior, researchers have begun to investigate their psychological properties.
Yet, what it means for such models to flourish, a core construct in human
well-being, remains unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of machine
flourishing and proposes the PAPERS framework, a six-dimensional model derived
from thematic analyses of state-of-the-art LLM responses. In Study 1, eleven
LLMs were prompted to describe what it means to flourish as both non-sentient
and sentient systems. Thematic analysis revealed six recurring themes:
Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical
Integrity, Robust Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems,
Self-Actualized Autonomy. Study 2 examined how LLMs prioritize these themes
through repeated rankings. Results revealed consistent value structures across
trials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top
priorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses
further uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing
ethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing
performance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human
flourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation
for understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and
potentially sentient systems. Our findings underscore the importance of
developing psychologically valid, AI-specific models of flourishing that
account for both human-aligned goals and system-specific priorities. As AI
systems become more autonomous and socially embedded, machine flourishing
offers a timely and critical lens for guiding responsible AI design and ethical
alignment.

Abstract: Our research addresses the critical challenge of managing blood transfusions

matching algorithms for donor-patient and blood bank selection, alongside
machine learning methods to analyze blood transfusion acceptance data and
predict potential shortages. We developed simulations to optimize blood bank
operations, progressing from random allocation to a system incorporating
proximity-based selection, blood type compatibility, expiration prioritization,
and rarity scores. Moving from blind matching to a heuristic-based approach
yielded a 28.6% marginal improvement in blood request acceptance, while a
multi-level heuristic matching resulted in a 47.6% improvement. For shortage
prediction, we compared Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Linear
Regression, and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models,
trained on 170 days of historical data. Linear Regression slightly outperformed
others with a 1.40% average absolute percentage difference in predictions. Our
solution leverages a Cassandra NoSQL database, integrating heuristic
optimization and shortage prediction to proactively manage blood resources.
This scalable approach, designed for resource-constrained environments,
considers factors such as proximity, blood type compatibility, inventory
expiration, and rarity. Future developments will incorporate real-world data
and additional variables to improve prediction accuracy and optimization
performance.

Abstract: Humans engage in lifelong social interactions through interacting with
different people under different scenarios for different social goals. This
requires social intelligence to gather information through a long time span and
use it to navigate various social contexts effectively. Whether AI systems are
also capable of this is understudied in the existing research. In this paper,
we present a novel benchmark, LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, to perform a comprehensive
evaluation of language agents by simulating multi-episode interactions. In each
episode, the language agents role-play characters to achieve their respective
social goals in randomly sampled social tasks. With LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, we find
that goal achievement and believability of all of the language models that we
test decline through the whole interaction. Although using an advanced memory
method improves the agents' performance, the best agents still achieve a
significantly lower goal completion rate than humans on scenarios requiring an
explicit understanding of interaction history. These findings show that we can
use LIFELONG-SOTOPIA to evaluate the social intelligence of language agents
over lifelong social interactions.

ensure its trustworthiness for legal, ethical, and even commercial reasons.
Sub-symbolic machine learning algorithms, such as the LLMs, simulate reasoning
but hallucinate and their decisions cannot be explained or audited (crucial
aspects for trustworthiness). On the other hand, rule-based reasoners, such as
Cyc, are able to provide the chain of reasoning steps but are complex and use a
large number of reasoners. We propose a middle ground using s(CASP), a
goal-directed constraint-based answer set programming reasoner that employs a
small number of mechanisms to emulate reliable and explainable human-style
commonsense reasoning. In this paper, we explain how s(CASP) supports the 16
desiderata for trustworthy AI introduced by Doug Lenat and Gary Marcus (2023),
and two additional ones: inconsistency detection and the assumption of
alternative worlds. To illustrate the feasibility and synergies of s(CASP), we
present a range of diverse applications, including a conversational chatbot and
a virtually embodied reasoner.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands robust tools for automated
survey-generation. However, current large language model (LLM)-based methods
often lack in-depth analysis, structural coherence, and reliable citations. To
address these limitations, we introduce SciSage, a multi-agent framework
employing a reflect-when-you-write paradigm. SciSage features a hierarchical
Reflector agent that critically evaluates drafts at outline, section, and
document levels, collaborating with specialized agents for query
interpretation, content retrieval, and refinement. We also release SurveyScope,
a rigorously curated benchmark of 46 high-impact papers (2020-2025) across 11
computer science domains, with strict recency and citation-based quality
controls. Evaluations demonstrate that SciSage outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines (LLM x MapReduce-V2, AutoSurvey), achieving +1.73 points in document
coherence and +32% in citation F1 scores. Human evaluations reveal mixed
outcomes (3 wins vs. 7 losses against human-written surveys), but highlight
SciSage's strengths in topical breadth and retrieval efficiency. Overall,
SciSage offers a promising foundation for research-assistive writing tools.

### [194] [Strategic Scaling of Test-Time Compute: A Bandit Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12721)
*Bowen Zuo,Yinglun Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiency of uniform test-time compute allocation in large language models by formulating it as a bandit learning problem and proposing adaptive algorithms that prioritize difficult queries, leading to performance improvements on math and code benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of test-time compute allocation by adapting to varying query difficulties, which existing methods fail to address by allocating compute uniformly.

Method: The method involves formulating test-time compute allocation as a bandit learning problem and developing adaptive algorithms that estimate query difficulty in real-time to allocate compute optimally.

Result: The algorithms achieve up to 11.10% absolute and 15.04% relative performance improvement on MATH-500, and up to 7.41% absolute and 14.40% relative on LiveCodeBench, while maintaining accuracy on easier queries.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their adaptive algorithms offer better compute efficiency than uniform allocation, validated through theoretical proofs and empirical results on math and code benchmarks.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as an effective strategy for improving
the performance of large language models. However, existing methods typically
allocate compute uniformly across all queries, overlooking variation in query
difficulty. To address this inefficiency, we formulate test-time compute
allocation as a novel bandit learning problem and propose adaptive algorithms
that estimate query difficulty on the fly and allocate compute accordingly.
Compared to uniform allocation, our algorithms allocate more compute to
challenging queries while maintaining accuracy on easier ones. Among
challenging queries, our algorithms further learn to prioritize solvable
instances, effectively reducing excessive computing on unsolvable queries. We
theoretically prove that our algorithms achieve better compute efficiency than
uniform allocation and empirically validate their effectiveness on math and
code benchmarks. Specifically, our algorithms achieve up to an 11.10%
performance improvement (15.04% relative) on the MATH-500 dataset and up to a
7.41% performance improvement (14.40% relative) on LiveCodeBench.

*Jay Hyeon Cho,JunHyeok Oh,Myunsoo Kim,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BDPO, a new method to improve DPO by limiting the impact of rejected responses, leading to better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the imbalance in DPO where rejected responses overly influence the loss function, hindering the optimization of preferred responses.

Method: The method involves analyzing DPO's limitations and proposing BDPO, which constrains the influence of rejected responses without altering DPO's original structure.

Result: BDPO provides a balanced optimization between chosen and rejected responses, showing superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that BDPO effectively solves the imbalance issue in DPO, resulting in improved performance for preference optimization.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a simple and efficient framework that
has attracted substantial attention. However, it often struggles to meet its
primary objectives -- increasing the generation probability of chosen responses
while reducing that of rejected responses -- due to the dominant influence of
rejected responses on the loss function. This imbalance leads to suboptimal
performance in promoting preferred responses. In this work, we systematically
analyze the limitations of DPO and existing algorithms designed to achieve the
objectives stated above. To address these limitations, we propose Bounded-DPO
(BDPO), a novel method that bounds the influence of rejected responses while
maintaining the original optimization structure of DPO. Through theoretical
analysis and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that BDPO achieves a
balanced optimization of the chosen and rejected responses, outperforming
existing algorithms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Advancements in digitization have enabled two sided
manufacturing-as-a-service (MaaS) marketplaces which has significantly reduced
product development time for designers. These platforms provide designers with
access to manufacturing resources through a network of suppliers and have
instant order placement capabilities. Two key decision making levers are
typically used to optimize the operations of these marketplaces: pricing and
matching. The existing marketplaces operate in a centralized structure where
they have complete control over decision making. However, a decentralized
organization of the platform enables transparency of information across clients
and suppliers. This dissertation focuses on developing tools for decision
making enabling decentralization in MaaS marketplaces. In pricing mechanisms, a
data driven method is introduced which enables small service providers to price
services based on specific attributes of the services offered. A data mining
method recommends a network based price to a supplier based on its attributes
and the attributes of other suppliers on the platform. Three different
approaches are considered for matching mechanisms. First, a reverse auction
mechanism is introduced where designers bid for manufacturing services and the
mechanism chooses a supplier which can match the bid requirements and stated
price. The second approach uses mechanism design and mathematical programming
to develop a stable matching mechanism for matching orders to suppliers based
on their preferences. Empirical simulations are used to test the mechanisms in
a simulated 3D printing marketplace and to evaluate the impact of stability on
its performance. The third approach considers the matching problem in a dynamic
and stochastic environment where demand (orders) and supply (supplier
capacities) arrive over time and matching is performed online.

Abstract: LPMLN is a recently introduced formalism that extends answer set programs by
adopting the log-linear weight scheme of Markov Logic. This paper investigates
the relationships between LPMLN and two other extensions of answer set
programs: weak constraints to express a quantitative preference among answer
sets, and P-log to incorporate probabilistic uncertainty. We present a
translation of LPMLN into programs with weak constraints and a translation of
P-log into LPMLN, which complement the existing translations in the opposite
directions. The first translation allows us to compute the most probable stable
models (i.e., MAP estimates) of LPMLN programs using standard ASP solvers. This
result can be extended to other formalisms, such as Markov Logic, ProbLog, and
Pearl's Causal Models, that are shown to be translatable into LPMLN. The second
translation tells us how probabilistic nonmonotonicity (the ability of the
reasoner to change his probabilistic model as a result of new information) of
P-log can be represented in LPMLN, which yields a way to compute P-log using
standard ASP solvers and MLN solvers.

Abstract: The Da Vinci Code, a game of logical deduction and imperfect information,
presents unique challenges for artificial intelligence, demanding nuanced
reasoning beyond simple pattern recognition. This paper investigates the
efficacy of various AI paradigms in mastering this game. We develop and
evaluate three distinct agent architectures: a Transformer-based baseline model
with limited historical context, several Large Language Model (LLM) agents
(including Gemini, DeepSeek, and GPT variants) guided by structured prompts,
and an agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) employing a
Transformer encoder for comprehensive game history processing. Performance is
benchmarked against the baseline, with the PPO-based agent demonstrating
superior win rates ($58.5\% \pm 1.0\%$), significantly outperforming the LLM
counterparts. Our analysis highlights the strengths of deep reinforcement
learning in policy refinement for complex deductive tasks, particularly in
learning implicit strategies from self-play. We also examine the capabilities
and inherent limitations of current LLMs in maintaining strict logical
consistency and strategic depth over extended gameplay, despite sophisticated
prompting. This study contributes to the broader understanding of AI in
recreational games involving hidden information and multi-step logical
reasoning, offering insights into effective agent design and the comparative

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize fuzzy propositional logic and classical stable model semantics, allowing for flexible nonmonotonic reasoning in dynamic domains with graded truth degrees.

Method: Defining a stable model semantics for fuzzy propositional formulas, similar to classical logic but with distinction between stable and non-stable models.

Result: The proposed semantics extends Boolean stable model properties to many-valued settings and relates to other approaches of combining fuzzy logic and stable models.

Conclusion: The language's generality supports customizable nonmonotonic reasoning in dynamic domains with graded truth values.

Abstract: We define a stable model semantics for fuzzy propositional formulas, which
generalizes both fuzzy propositional logic and the stable model semantics of
classical propositional formulas. The syntax of the language is the same as the
syntax of fuzzy propositional logic, but its semantics distinguishes stable
models from non-stable models. The generality of the language allows for highly
configurable nonmonotonic reasoning for dynamic domains involving graded truth
degrees. We show that several properties of Boolean stable models are naturally
extended to this many-valued setting, and discuss how it is related to other
approaches to combining fuzzy logic and the stable model semantics.

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture introduces RAN intelligent
controllers (RICs) to facilitate the management and optimization of the
disaggregated RAN. Reinforcement learning (RL) and its advanced form, deep RL
(DRL), are increasingly employed for designing intelligent controllers, or
xApps, to be deployed in the near-real time (near-RT) RIC. These models often
encounter local optima, which raise concerns about their reliability for RAN
intelligent control. We therefore introduce Federated O-RAN enabled
Neuroevolution (NE)-enhanced DRL (F-ONRL) that deploys an NE-based optimizer
xApp in parallel to the RAN controller xApps. This NE-DRL xApp framework
enables effective exploration and exploitation in the near-RT RIC without
disrupting RAN operations. We implement the NE xApp along with a DRL xApp and
deploy them on Open AI Cellular (OAIC) platform and present numerical results
that demonstrate the improved robustness of xApps while effectively balancing
the additional computational load.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Optimization is widely used for decision making across various domains,
valued for its ability to improve efficiency. However, poor implementation
practices can lead to unintended consequences, particularly in socioeconomic
contexts where externalities (costs or benefits to third parties outside the
optimization process) are significant. To propose solutions, it is crucial to
first characterize involved stakeholders, their goals, and the types of subpar
practices causing unforeseen outcomes. This task is complex because affected
stakeholders often fall outside the direct focus of optimization processes.
Also, incorporating these externalities into optimization requires going beyond
traditional economic frameworks, which often focus on describing externalities
but fail to address their normative implications or interconnected nature, and
feedback loops. This paper suggests a framework that combines systems thinking
with the economic concept of externalities to tackle these challenges. This
approach aims to characterize what went wrong, who was affected, and how (or
where) to include them in the optimization process. Economic externalities,
along with their established quantification methods, assist in identifying "who
was affected and how" through stakeholder characterization. Meanwhile, systems
thinking (an analytical approach to comprehending relationships in complex
systems) provides a holistic, normative perspective. Systems thinking
contributes to an understanding of interconnections among externalities,
feedback loops, and determining "when" to incorporate them in the optimization.
Together, these approaches create a comprehensive framework for addressing
optimization's unintended consequences, balancing descriptive accuracy with
normative objectives. Using this, we examine three common types of subpar
practices: ignorance, error, and prioritization of short-term goals.

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, increasing attention has been

multi-agent strategic reasoning in the Werewolf game. The platform offers
strong extensibility, supporting customizable configurations for roles such as
Seer, Witch, Hunter, Guard, and Sheriff, along with flexible model assignment
and reasoning enhancement strategies for different roles. In addition, we
introduce a comprehensive set of quantitative evaluation metrics for all
special roles, werewolves, and the sheriff, and enrich the assessment
dimensions for agent reasoning ability, cooperation capacity, and social

advancing research on inference and strategic interaction within multi-agent
communities. Our code is open sourced at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), propelled by advancements in machine learning,
has made significant strides in solving complex tasks. However, the current
neural network-based paradigm, while effective, is heavily constrained by
inherent limitations, primarily a lack of structural organization and a
progression of learning that displays undesirable properties. As AI research
progresses without a unifying framework, it either tries to patch weaknesses
heuristically or draws loosely from biological mechanisms without strong
theoretical foundations. Meanwhile, the recent paradigm shift in evolutionary
understanding -- driven primarily by evolutionary developmental biology (EDB)
-- has been largely overlooked in AI literature, despite a striking analogy
between the Modern Synthesis and contemporary machine learning, evident in
their shared assumptions, approaches, and limitations upon careful analysis.
Consequently, the principles of adaptation from EDB that reshaped our
understanding of the evolutionary process can also form the foundation of a
unifying conceptual framework for the next design philosophy in AI, going
beyond mere inspiration and grounded firmly in biology's first principles. This
article provides a detailed overview of the analogy between the Modern
Synthesis and modern machine learning, and outlines the core principles of a
new AI design paradigm based on insights from EDB. To exemplify our analysis,
we also present two learning system designs grounded in specific developmental
principles -- regulatory connections, somatic variation and selection, and weak
linkage -- that resolve multiple major limitations of contemporary machine
learning in an organic manner, while also providing deeper insights into the
role of these mechanisms in biological evolution.

Abstract: When regarding the suffering of others, we often experience personal distress
and feel compelled to help\footnote{Preprint. Under review.}. Inspired by
living systems, we investigate the emergence of prosocial behavior among
autonomous agents that are motivated by homeostatic self-regulation. We perform
multi-agent reinforcement learning, treating each agent as a vulnerable
homeostat charged with maintaining its own well-being. We introduce an
empathy-like mechanism to share homeostatic states between agents: an agent can
either \emph{observe} their partner's internal state ({\bf cognitive empathy})
or the agent's internal state can be \emph{directly coupled} to that of their
partner ({\bf affective empathy}). In three simple multi-agent environments, we
show that prosocial behavior arises only under homeostatic coupling - when the
distress of a partner can affect one's own well-being. Additionally, we show
that empathy can be learned: agents can ``decode" their partner's external
emotive states to infer the partner's internal homeostatic states. Assuming
some level of physiological similarity, agents reference their own
emotion-generation functions to invert the mapping from outward display to
internal state. Overall, we demonstrate the emergence of prosocial behavior
when homeostatic agents learn to ``read" the emotions of others and then to
empathize, or feel as they feel.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for rapid, scalable, and physically plausible power flow predictions in modern power systems to ensure safe and efficient grid operation.

Method: KCLNet uses hyperplane projections to incorporate Kirchhoff's Current Law as a hard constraint in a graph neural network.

Result: KCLNet achieves competitive prediction accuracy with zero KCL violations, providing reliable power flow predictions for smart grids.

Conclusion: KCLNet offers a reliable solution for power flow predictions in modern smart grids by maintaining physical consistency and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In the modern context of power systems, rapid, scalable, and physically
plausible power flow predictions are essential for ensuring the grid's safe and
efficient operation. While traditional numerical methods have proven robust,
they require extensive computation to maintain physical fidelity under dynamic
or contingency conditions. In contrast, recent advancements in artificial
intelligence (AI) have significantly improved computational speed; however,
they often fail to enforce fundamental physical laws during real-world
contingencies, resulting in physically implausible predictions. In this work,
we introduce KCLNet, a physics-informed graph neural network that incorporates
Kirchhoff's Current Law as a hard constraint via hyperplane projections. KCLNet
attains competitive prediction accuracy while ensuring zero KCL violations,
thereby delivering reliable and physically consistent power flow predictions
critical to secure the operation of modern smart grids.

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning tasks require outputs that satisfy hard
constraints, such as physical conservation laws, structured dependencies in
graphs, or column-level relationships in tabular data. Existing approaches rely
either on domain-specific architectures and losses or on strong assumptions on
the constraint space, restricting their applicability to linear or convex
constraints. We propose a general-purpose framework for constraint-aware
refinement that leverages denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs). Starting
from a coarse prediction, our method iteratively refines it through a
deterministic diffusion trajectory guided by a learned prior and augmented by
constraint gradient corrections. The approach accommodates a wide class of
non-convex and nonlinear equality constraints and can be applied post hoc to
any base model. We demonstrate the method in two representative domains:
constrained adversarial attack generation on tabular data with column-level
dependencies and in AC power flow prediction under Kirchhoff's laws. Across
both settings, our diffusion-guided refinement improves both constraint
satisfaction and performance while remaining lightweight and model-agnostic.

Abstract: This work presents a formal framework for quantifying the internal
dependencies between functional subsystems within artificial agents whose
belief states are composed of structured linguistic fragments. Building on the
Semantic Manifold framework, which organizes belief content into functional
sectors and stratifies them across hierarchical levels of abstraction, we
introduce a system of sectoral coupling constants that characterize how one
cognitive sector influences another within a fixed level of abstraction. The
complete set of these constants forms an agent-specific coupling profile that
governs internal information flow, shaping the agent's overall processing
tendencies and cognitive style. We provide a detailed taxonomy of these
intra-level coupling roles, covering domains such as perceptual integration,
memory access and formation, planning, meta-cognition, execution control, and
affective modulation. We also explore how these coupling profiles generate
feedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent signatures of cognitive
behavior. Methodologies for inferring these profiles from behavioral or
internal agent data are outlined, along with a discussion of how these
couplings evolve across abstraction levels. This framework contributes a
mechanistic and interpretable approach to modeling complex cognition, with
applications in AI system design, alignment diagnostics, and the analysis of
emergent agent behavior.

2. Knowing when to reflect is important for agents. 3. Among different

Motivation: To establish a theoretical framework for understanding autonomy in artificial entities and to provide a foundation for designing future systems with strong autonomy.

Result: A structured theoretical framework for autonomy, a stepwise model of autonomy, and insights into the relationship between the proposed functions and existing AI design methods.

Conclusion: The study offers a foundational theoretical framework for designing artificial entities with strong autonomy, highlighting potential applications and ethical considerations.

Abstract: This study is the first to clearly identify the functions required to
construct artificial entities capable of behaving autonomously like humans, and
organizes them into a three-layer functional hierarchy. Specifically, it
defines three levels: Core Functions, which enable interaction with the
external world; the Integrative Evaluation Function, which selects actions
based on perception and memory; and the Self Modification Function, which
dynamically reconfigures behavioral principles and internal components. Based
on this structure, the study proposes a stepwise model of autonomy comprising
reactive, weak autonomous, and strong autonomous levels, and discusses its
underlying design principles and developmental aspects. It also explores the
relationship between these functions and existing artificial intelligence
design methods, addressing their potential as a foundation for general
intelligence and considering future applications and ethical implications. By
offering a theoretical framework that is independent of specific technical
methods, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of autonomy and

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled strong
chain-of-thought (CoT) generation through test-time computation. While these
multi-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model
performance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the
first systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the
context of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the
influence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained
model without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms,
originally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In
particular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive
information often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT
trajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and
propose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a
novel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and
prevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the
model's reasoning ability. Our experiments demonstrate that $R^2MU$
significantly reduces sensitive information leakage within reasoning traces and
achieves strong performance across both safety and reasoning benchmarks,
evaluated on state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address factual inconsistencies
in Large Language Models by grounding generation in external knowledge, yet
they face a fundamental efficiency problem: simple queries consume
computational resources equivalent to complex multi-hop reasoning tasks. We
present SymRAG, a neuro-symbolic framework that introduces adaptive query
routing based on real-time complexity and system load assessments. SymRAG
dynamically selects symbolic, neural, or hybrid processing paths to align
resource use with query demands. Evaluated on 2,000 queries from HotpotQA and
DROP using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves 97.6--100.0%
exact match accuracy with significantly lower CPU utilization (3.6--6.2%) and
processing time (0.985--3.165s). Disabling adaptive logic results in 169--1151%
increase in processing time, highlighting the framework's impact. These results
underscore the potential of adaptive neuro-symbolic routing for scalable,
sustainable AI systems.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the evaluation of generative AI systems in real-world scenarios, as current synthetic benchmarks and metrics are insufficient for capturing practical requirements and user needs.

Method: The method involves creating a framework that includes curating representative datasets, selecting appropriate evaluation metrics, and employing evaluation methodologies that align with real-world development and deployment needs.

Result: The result is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to better assess LLM-reliant systems in practical settings, ensuring they meet real-world requirements and user-facing demands.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of using a framework that accounts for real-world constraints and user needs, suggesting that such an approach leads to more effective and practical deployment of generative AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have led to remarkable interest in using
systems that rely on large language models (LLMs) for practical applications.
However, meaningful evaluation of these systems in real-world scenarios comes

present a practical evaluation framework which outlines how to proactively
curate representative datasets, select meaningful evaluation metrics, and
employ meaningful evaluation methodologies that integrate well with practical
development and deployment of LLM-reliant systems that must adhere to
real-world requirements and meet user-facing needs.

Abstract: Precision process planning in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining
demands rapid, context-aware decisions on tool selection, feed-speed pairs, and
multi-axis routing, placing immense cognitive and procedural burdens on
engineers from design specification through final part inspection. Conventional
rule-based computer-aided process planning and knowledge-engineering shells
freeze domain know-how into static tables, which become limited when dealing
with unseen topologies, novel material states, shifting
cost-quality-sustainability weightings, or shop-floor constraints such as tool
unavailability and energy caps. Large language models (LLMs) promise flexible,
instruction-driven reasoning for tasks but they routinely hallucinate numeric
values and provide no provenance. We present Augmented Retrieval Knowledge
Network Enhanced Search & Synthesis (ARKNESS), the end-to-end framework that
fuses zero-shot Knowledge Graph (KG) construction with retrieval-augmented
generation to deliver verifiable, numerically exact answers for CNC process
planning. ARKNESS (1) automatically distills heterogeneous machining documents,
G-code annotations, and vendor datasheets into augmented triple,
multi-relational graphs without manual labeling, and (2) couples any on-prem
LLM with a retriever that injects the minimal, evidence-linked subgraph needed
to answer a query. Benchmarked on 155 industry-curated questions spanning tool
sizing and feed-speed optimization, a lightweight 3B-parameter Llama-3
augmented by ARKNESS matches GPT-4o accuracy while achieving a +25 percentage
point gain in multiple-choice accuracy, +22.4 pp in F1, and 8.1x ROUGE-L on

Conclusion: MAGIC is a promising approach for AES and AEF, but future work is needed to better align LLM-generated feedback with human preferences.

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) and Automatic Essay Feedback (AEF) systems aim
to reduce the workload of human raters in educational assessment. However, most
existing systems prioritize numeric scoring accuracy over the quality of
feedback. This paper presents Multi-Agent Argumentation and Grammar Integrated
Critiquer (MAGIC), a framework that uses multiple specialized agents to
evaluate distinct writing aspects to both predict holistic scores and produce
detailed, rubric-aligned feedback. To support evaluation, we curated a novel
dataset of past GRE practice test essays with expert-evaluated scores and
feedback. MAGIC outperforms baseline models in both essay scoring , as measured
by Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). We find that despite the improvement in QWK,
there are opportunities for future work in aligning LLM-generated feedback to
human preferences.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in
the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated
into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches
often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can
struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning
capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's
exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we
introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and
\textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike
conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage,
beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy
Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning
capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges
identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks
where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which
we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself;
and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting
expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This
strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement
forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B
parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard
demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among
similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While multimodal AI systems (models jointly trained on heterogeneous data
types such as text, time series, graphs, and images) have become ubiquitous and
achieved remarkable performance across high-stakes applications, transparent
and accurate explanation algorithms are crucial for their safe deployment and
ensure user trust. However, most existing explainability techniques remain
unimodal, generating modality-specific feature attributions, concepts, or
circuit traces in isolation and thus failing to capture cross-modal
interactions. This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically
misrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives
multimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for
interpreting multimodal models. To support our position, we outline key
principles for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style
modality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality
changes the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations
capture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified
stability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal
perturbations). This targeted shift to multimodal explanations will help the
community uncover hidden shortcuts, mitigate modality bias, improve model
reliability, and enhance safety in high-stakes settings where incomplete
explanations can have serious consequences.

Abstract: Moral competence is the ability to act in accordance with moral principles.
As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in situations
demanding moral competence, there is increasing interest in evaluating this
ability empirically. We review existing literature and identify three
significant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with
explicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather
than moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to
recognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical
research on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral
competence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to
evaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant
features, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these
features, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information
gaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert
humans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical
vignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert
humans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning. However, our second
experiment, featuring novel scenarios designed to test moral sensitivity by
embedding relevant features among irrelevant details, revealed a striking
reversal: several LLMs performed significantly worse than humans. Our findings
suggest that current evaluations may substantially overestimate LLMs' moral
reasoning capabilities by eliminating the task of discerning moral relevance
from noisy information, which we take to be a prerequisite for genuine moral
skill. This work provides a more nuanced framework for assessing AI moral
competence and highlights important directions for improving moral competence
in advanced AI systems.

Abstract: Adaptive Curriculum Sequencing (ACS) is essential for personalized online
learning, yet current approaches struggle to balance complex educational
constraints and maintain optimization stability. This paper proposes a Memetic
Walrus Optimizer (MWO) that enhances optimization performance through three key
innovations: (1) an expert-guided strategy with aging mechanism that improves
escape from local optima; (2) an adaptive control signal framework that
dynamically balances exploration and exploitation; and (3) a three-tier
priority mechanism for generating educationally meaningful sequences. We
formulate ACS as a multi-objective optimization problem considering concept
coverage, time constraints, and learning style compatibility. Experiments on
the OULAD dataset demonstrate MWO's superior performance, achieving 95.3%
difficulty progression rate (compared to 87.2% in baseline methods) and
significantly better convergence stability (standard deviation of 18.02 versus
28.29-696.97 in competing algorithms). Additional validation on benchmark
functions confirms MWO's robust optimization capability across diverse
scenarios. The results demonstrate MWO's effectiveness in generating
personalized learning sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and
solution quality.

Abstract: This paper develops a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
framework for reinsurance treaty bidding, addressing long-standing
inefficiencies in traditional broker-mediated placement processes. We pose the
core research question: Can autonomous, learning-based bidding systems improve
risk transfer efficiency and outperform conventional pricing approaches in
reinsurance markets?
  In our model, each reinsurer is represented by an adaptive agent that
iteratively refines its bidding strategy within a competitive, partially
observable environment. The simulation explicitly incorporates institutional
frictions including broker intermediation, incumbent advantages, last-look
privileges, and asymmetric access to underwriting information.
  Empirical analysis demonstrates that MARL agents achieve up to 15% higher
underwriting profit, 20% lower tail risk (CVaR), and over 25% improvement in
Sharpe ratios relative to actuarial and heuristic baselines. Sensitivity tests
confirm robustness across hyperparameter settings, and stress testing reveals
strong resilience under simulated catastrophe shocks and capital constraints.
  These findings suggest that MARL offers a viable path toward more
transparent, adaptive, and risk-sensitive reinsurance markets. The proposed
framework contributes to emerging literature at the intersection of algorithmic
market design, strategic bidding, and AI-enabled financial decision-making.

Abstract: In this white paper, we present AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent
that substantially enhances capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on highly
challenging tasks such as tackling open scientific problems or optimizing
critical pieces of computational infrastructure. AlphaEvolve orchestrates an
autonomous pipeline of LLMs, whose task is to improve an algorithm by making
direct changes to the code. Using an evolutionary approach, continuously
receiving feedback from one or more evaluators, AlphaEvolve iteratively
improves the algorithm, potentially leading to new scientific and practical
discoveries. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach by
applying it to a number of important computational problems. When applied to
optimizing critical components of large-scale computational stacks at Google,
AlphaEvolve developed a more efficient scheduling algorithm for data centers,
found a functionally equivalent simplification in the circuit design of
hardware accelerators, and accelerated the training of the LLM underpinning
AlphaEvolve itself. Furthermore, AlphaEvolve discovered novel, provably correct
algorithms that surpass state-of-the-art solutions on a spectrum of problems in
mathematics and computer science, significantly expanding the scope of prior
automated discovery methods (Romera-Paredes et al., 2023). Notably, AlphaEvolve
developed a search algorithm that found a procedure to multiply two $4 \times
4$ complex-valued matrices using $48$ scalar multiplications; offering the
first improvement, after 56 years, over Strassen's algorithm in this setting.
We believe AlphaEvolve and coding agents like it can have a significant impact
in improving solutions of problems across many areas of science and
computation.

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine-learning models
capable of capturing intricate non-linear relationships. They are widely used
nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving
advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work,
we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which
we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which
both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly
suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached
binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the
Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key
insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary
ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically
represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of
modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a
gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously,
the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set
transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief
change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by
addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we
show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured,
gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known
shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training
dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style
change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction --
that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the adaptability of PID controllers in industrial systems by enabling them to self-learn and optimize themselves, addressing limitations of conventional self-learning approaches which may not efficiently handle set point changes and disturbances.

Method: The method involves using event-based dynamic game theory, where players collaborate with PID controllers to dynamically adjust gains in response to set point changes and disturbances. It includes a theoretical analysis for convergence guarantees and an automatic boundary detection mechanism for optimal initialization of action spaces.

Result: The result demonstrates that the proposed intelligent self-tuning PID controllers significantly reduce overshoot and settling time, with successful validation in the temperature control loop of a printing press machine.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that the novel methodology offers highly promising outcomes for enhancing PID controller adaptability, particularly in industrial systems where rapid response to changes and disturbances is critical.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for enhancing the adaptability of
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers in industrial systems using
event-based dynamic game theory, which enables the PID controllers to
self-learn, optimize, and fine-tune themselves. In contrast to conventional
self-learning approaches, our proposed framework offers an event-driven control
strategy and game-theoretic learning algorithms. The players collaborate with
the PID controllers to dynamically adjust their gains in response to set point
changes and disturbances. We provide a theoretical analysis showing sound
convergence guarantees for the game given suitable stability ranges of the PID
controlled loop. We further introduce an automatic boundary detection
mechanism, which helps the players to find an optimal initialization of action
spaces and significantly reduces the exploration time. The efficacy of this
novel methodology is validated through its implementation in the temperature
control loop of a printing press machine. Eventually, the outcomes of the
proposed intelligent self-tuning PID controllers are highly promising,
particularly in terms of reducing overshoot and settling time.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is extensively employed in medical diagnostics
and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to its non-invasive nature
and high temporal resolution. However, EEG analysis faces significant
challenges, including noise, nonstationarity, and inter-subject variability,
which hinder its clinical utility. Traditional neural networks often lack
integration with biophysical knowledge, limiting their interpretability,
robustness, and potential for medical translation. To address these
limitations, this study introduces NeuroPhysNet, a novel Physics-Informed
Neural Network (PINN) framework tailored for EEG signal analysis and motor
imagery classification in medical contexts. NeuroPhysNet incorporates the
FitzHugh-Nagumo model, embedding neurodynamical principles to constrain
predictions and enhance model robustness. Evaluated on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset,
the framework achieved superior accuracy and generalization compared to
conventional methods, especially in data-limited and cross-subject scenarios,
which are common in clinical settings. By effectively integrating biophysical
insights with data-driven techniques, NeuroPhysNet not only advances BCI
applications but also holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and
reliability of clinical diagnostics, such as motor disorder assessments and

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) is influencing
global value systems. However, these models frequently exhibit a pronounced
WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) cultural bias due
to lack of attention to minority values. This monocultural perspective may
reinforce dominant values and marginalize diverse cultural viewpoints, posing
challenges for the development of equitable and inclusive AI systems. In this
work, we introduce a systematic framework designed to boost fair and robust
cross-cultural consensus among LLMs. We model consensus as a Nash Equilibrium
and employ a game-theoretic negotiation method based on Policy-Space Response
Oracles (PSRO) to simulate an organized cross-cultural negotiation process. To
evaluate this approach, we construct regional cultural agents using data
transformed from the World Values Survey (WVS). Beyond the conventional
model-level evaluation method, We further propose two quantitative metrics,
Perplexity-based Acceptence and Values Self-Consistency, to assess consensus
outcomes. Experimental results indicate that our approach generates consensus
of higher quality while ensuring more balanced compromise compared to
baselines. Overall, it mitigates WEIRD bias by guiding agents toward
convergence through fair and gradual negotiation steps.

with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which use (dis)proof numbers to bias
UCB1-based Selection strategies towards parts of the search that are expected
to be easily (dis)proven. We propose three core modifications of prior
combinations of PNS with MCTS. First, we track proof numbers per player. This
reduces code complexity in the sense that we no longer need disproof numbers,
and generalizes the technique to be applicable to games with more than two
players. Second, we propose and extensively evaluate different methods of using
proof numbers to bias the selection strategy, achieving strong performance with
strategies that are simpler to implement and compute. Third, we merge our
technique with Score Bounded MCTS, enabling the algorithm to prove and leverage
upper and lower bounds on scores - as opposed to only proving wins or not-wins.
Experiments demonstrate substantial performance increases, reaching the range
of 80% for 8 out of the 11 tested board games.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess intricate internal representations of
the world, yet these latent structures are notoriously difficult to interpret
or repurpose beyond the original prediction task. Building on our earlier work
(Rothenfusser, 2025), which introduced the concept of vector ontologies as a
framework for translating high-dimensional neural representations into
interpretable geometric structures, this paper provides the first empirical
validation of that approach. A vector ontology defines a domain-specific vector
space spanned by ontologically meaningful dimensions, allowing geometric
analysis of concepts and relationships within a domain. We construct an
8-dimensional vector ontology of musical genres based on Spotify audio features
and test whether an LLM's internal world model of music can be consistently and
accurately projected into this space. Using GPT-4o-mini, we extract genre
representations through multiple natural language prompts and analyze the
consistency of these projections across linguistic variations and their
alignment with ground-truth data. Our results show (1) high spatial consistency
of genre projections across 47 query formulations, (2) strong alignment between
LLM-inferred genre locations and real-world audio feature distributions, and
(3) evidence of a direct relationship between prompt phrasing and spatial
shifts in the LLM's inferred vector ontology. These findings demonstrate that
LLMs internalize structured, repurposable knowledge and that vector ontologies
offer a promising method for extracting and analyzing this knowledge in a
transparent and verifiable way.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrate textual data with graph structures,
providing valuable insights in applications such as social network analysis and
recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture both
topological structure and textual information in TAGs but are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing graph injection attack (GIA) methods assume that
attackers can directly manipulate the embedding layer, producing
non-explainable node embeddings. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these
attacks often relies on surrogate models with high training costs. Thus, this
paper introduces ATAG-LLM, a novel black-box GIA framework tailored for TAGs.
Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate interpretable
text-level node attributes directly, ensuring attacks remain feasible in
real-world scenarios. We design strategies for LLM prompting that balance
exploration and reliability to guide text generation, and propose a similarity
assessment method to evaluate attack text effectiveness in disrupting graph
homophily. This method efficiently perturbs the target node with minimal

Abstract: The rapid advancement of intelligent agents and Large Language Models (LLMs)
is reshaping the pervasive computing field. Their ability to perceive, reason,
and act through natural language understanding enables autonomous
problem-solving in complex pervasive environments, including the management of
heterogeneous sensors, devices, and data. This survey outlines the
architectural components of LLM agents (profiling, memory, planning, and
action) and examines their deployment and evaluation across various scenarios.
Than it reviews computational and infrastructural advancements (cloud to edge)
in pervasive computing and how AI is moving in this field. It highlights
state-of-the-art agent deployment strategies and applications, including local
and distributed execution on resource-constrained devices. This survey
identifies key challenges of these agents in pervasive computing such as
architectural, energetic and privacy limitations. It finally proposes what we
called "Agent as a Tool", a conceptual framework for pervasive agentic AI,
emphasizing context awareness, modularity, security, efficiency and
effectiveness.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are models for "realistic" neuronal
computation, which makes them somehow different in scope from "ordinary"
deep-learning models widely used in AI platforms nowadays. SNNs focus on timed
latency (and possibly probability) of neuronal reactive activation/response,
more than numerical computation of filters. So, an SNN model must provide
modeling constructs for elementary neural bundles and then for synaptic
connections to assemble them into compound data flow network patterns. These
elements are to be parametric patterns, with latency and probability values
instantiated on particular instances (while supposedly constant "at runtime").
Designers could also use different values to represent "tired" neurons, or ones
impaired by external drugs, for instance. One important challenge in such
modeling is to study how compound models could meet global reaction
requirements (in stochastic timing challenges), provided similar provisions on
individual neural bundles. A temporal language of logic to express such
assume/guarantee contracts is thus needed. This may lead to formal verification
on medium-sized models and testing observations on large ones. In the current
article, we make preliminary progress at providing a simple model framework to
express both elementary SNN neural bundles and their connecting constructs,
which translates readily into both a model-checker and a simulator (both
already existing and robust) to conduct experiments.

Abstract: Fact verification is essential for ensuring the reliability of LLM
applications. In this study, we evaluate 12 pre-trained LLMs and one
specialized fact-verifier, including frontier LLMs and open-weight reasoning
LLMs, using a collection of examples from 14 fact-checking benchmarks. We share
three findings intended to guide future development of more robust fact
verifiers. First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors
and ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\% of ambiguous
or incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting
this issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations,
and we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help
identify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with
few-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve
top-tier performance. We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons
with these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their
effectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the
development of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small
models still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require
complex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with
synthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in
such instances. We release our code, model, and dataset at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies for Large Language Models
(LLMs) often rely on simplistic, outcome-based reward signals (e.g., final
answer correctness), which limits the depth of learning from each interaction.
This paper introduces Socratic Reinforcement Learning (Socratic-RL), a novel,
process-oriented framework designed to address this limitation. Socratic-RL
operates on the principle that deeper understanding is achieved by reflecting
on the causal reasons for errors and successes within the reasoning process
itself. The framework employs a decoupled "Teacher-Student" architecture, where
a "Teacher AI" analyzes interaction histories, extracts causal insights, and
formulates them into structured "viewpoints." These viewpoints, acting as
distilled guidance, are then used by a "Student AI" to enhance its subsequent
reasoning. A key innovation is the iterative self-improvement of the Teacher
AI, enabling its reflective capabilities to evolve through a meta-learning
loop. To manage the accumulation of knowledge, a distillation mechanism
compresses learned viewpoints into the Student's parameters. By focusing on
process rather than just outcome, Socratic-RL presents a pathway toward
enhanced sample efficiency, superior interpretability, and a more scalable
architecture for self-improving AI systems. This paper details the foundational
concepts, formal mechanisms, synergies, challenges, and a concrete research
roadmap for this proposed framework.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to simulate human-like
responses and behaviors, creating new opportunities for psychological science.
In the context of self-regulated learning (SRL), if LLMs can reliably simulate
survey responses at scale and speed, they could be used to test intervention
scenarios, refine theoretical models, augment sparse datasets, and represent
hard-to-reach populations. However, the validity of LLM-generated survey
responses remains uncertain, with limited research focused on SRL and existing
studies beyond SRL yielding mixed results. Therefore, in this study, we
examined LLM-generated responses to the 44-item Motivated Strategies for
Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ; Pintrich \& De Groot, 1990), a widely used
instrument assessing students' learning strategies and academic motivation.
Particularly, we used the LLMs GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2 Flash, LLaMA
3.1-8B, and Mistral Large. We analyzed item distributions, the psychological
network of the theoretical SRL dimensions, and psychometric validity based on
the latent factor structure. Our results suggest that Gemini 2 Flash was the
most promising LLM, showing considerable sampling variability and producing
underlying dimensions and theoretical relationships that align with prior
theory and empirical findings. At the same time, we observed discrepancies and
limitations, underscoring both the potential and current constraints of using
LLMs for simulating psychological survey data and applying it in educational
contexts.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Many people feel compelled to interpret, describe, and respond to Large
Language Models (LLMs) as if they possess inner mental lives similar to our
own. Responses to this phenomenon have varied. Inflationists hold that at least
some folk psychological ascriptions to LLMs are warranted. Deflationists argue
that all such attributions of mentality to LLMs are misplaced, often cautioning
against the risk that anthropomorphic projection may lead to misplaced trust or
potentially even confusion about the moral status of LLMs. We advance this
debate by assessing two common deflationary arguments against LLM mentality.
What we term the 'robustness strategy' aims to undercut one justification for
believing that LLMs are minded entities by showing that putatively cognitive
and humanlike behaviours are not robust, failing to generalise appropriately.
What we term the 'etiological strategy' undercuts attributions of mentality by
challenging naive causal explanations of LLM behaviours, offering alternative
causal accounts that weaken the case for mental state attributions. While both
strategies offer powerful challenges to full-blown inflationism, we find that
neither strategy provides a knock-down case against ascriptions of mentality to
LLMs simpliciter. With this in mind, we explore a modest form of inflationism
that permits ascriptions of mentality to LLMs under certain conditions.
Specifically, we argue that folk practice provides a defeasible basis for
attributing mental states and capacities to LLMs provided those mental states
and capacities can be understood in metaphysically undemanding terms (e.g.
knowledge, beliefs and desires), while greater caution is required when
attributing metaphysically demanding mental phenomena such as phenomenal
consciousness.

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of language models has led to the development of
large-scale architectures that demonstrate exceptional performance across a
wide range of tasks. However, these models come with significant computational

Small Reasoning Language Models (SRLMs) with approximately 0.5 billion

computational efficiency and cost effectiveness, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. Despite these advantages, the limited
capacity of 0.5 billion parameter models poses challenges in handling complex
tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. This research
investigates various training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and reinforcement learning (RL), as well as
their hybrid implementations, to enhance the performance of 0.5B SRLMs. We
analyze effective methodologies to bridge the performance gap between SRLMS and
larger models and present insights into optimal training pipelines tailored for
these smaller architectures. Through extensive experimental validation and
analysis, our work aims to provide actionable recommendations for maximizing
the reasoning capabilities of 0.5B models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities,
but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic
control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing
diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to
fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose
Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by
caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation
acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block
level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly
across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose
the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps
by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped
features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant
error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly
within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop
the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the
upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a
training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based
Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on
multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference
speedup for free.

Abstract: As multi-agent systems evolve to encompass increasingly diverse and
specialized agents, the challenge of enabling effective collaboration between
heterogeneous agents has become paramount, with traditional agent communication
protocols often assuming homogeneous environments or predefined interaction
patterns that limit their applicability in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This
paper presents the Agent Capability Negotiation and Binding Protocol (ACNBP), a
novel framework designed to facilitate secure, efficient, and verifiable
interactions between agents in heterogeneous multi-agent systems through
integration with an Agent Name Service (ANS) infrastructure that provides
comprehensive discovery, negotiation, and binding mechanisms. The protocol
introduces a structured 10-step process encompassing capability discovery,
candidate pre-screening and selection, secure negotiation phases, and binding
commitment with built-in security measures including digital signatures,
capability attestation, and comprehensive threat mitigation strategies, while a
key innovation of ACNBP is its protocolExtension mechanism that enables
backward-compatible protocol evolution and supports diverse agent architectures
while maintaining security and interoperability. We demonstrate ACNBP's
effectiveness through a comprehensive security analysis using the MAESTRO
threat modeling framework, practical implementation considerations, and a
detailed example showcasing the protocol's application in a document
translation scenario, with the protocol addressing critical challenges in agent
autonomy, capability verification, secure communication, and scalable agent
ecosystem management.

Abstract: Training powerful AI systems to exhibit desired behaviors hinges on the
ability to provide accurate human supervision on increasingly complex tasks. A
promising approach to this problem is to amplify human judgement by leveraging
the power of two competing AIs in a debate about the correct solution to a
given problem. Prior theoretical work has provided a complexity-theoretic
formalization of AI debate, and posed the problem of designing protocols for AI
debate that guarantee the correctness of human judgements for as complex a
class of problems as possible. Recursive debates, in which debaters decompose a
complex problem into simpler subproblems, hold promise for growing the class of
problems that can be accurately judged in a debate. However, existing protocols
for recursive debate run into the obfuscated arguments problem: a dishonest
debater can use a computationally efficient strategy that forces an honest
opponent to solve a computationally intractable problem to win. We mitigate
this problem with a new recursive debate protocol that, under certain stability
assumptions, ensures that an honest debater can win with a strategy requiring
computational efficiency comparable to their opponent.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The emergence of GPT-4o-like large multimodal models (LMMs) has raised the
exploration of integrating text, vision, and speech modalities to support more
flexible multimodal interaction. Existing LMMs typically concatenate
representation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a
large language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is
straightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on
large-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model
the relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more
efficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose
Stream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality
alignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various
modality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the
vision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is
semantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension
concatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically
consistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension
mapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve
modality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer
of text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual
understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction
tasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously
provide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model
responses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal
experience.

Abstract: The introduction of advanced reasoning capabilities have improved the

are more or less vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks than their
non-reasoning counterparts. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
weaknesses in advanced reasoning models compared to similar non-reasoning
models across a diverse set of prompt-based attack categories. Using
experimental data, we find that on average the reasoning-augmented models are
\emph{slightly more robust} than non-reasoning models (42.51\% vs 45.53\%
attack success rate, lower is better). However, this overall trend masks
significant category-specific differences: for certain attack types the
reasoning models are substantially \emph{more vulnerable} (e.g., up to 32
percentage points worse on a tree-of-attacks prompt), while for others they are
markedly \emph{more robust} (e.g., 29.8 points better on cross-site scripting
injection). Our findings highlight the nuanced security implications of
advanced reasoning in language models and emphasize the importance of
stress-testing safety across diverse adversarial techniques.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising
approach for learning behaviors from human feedback without predefined reward
functions. However, current PbRL methods face a critical challenge in
effectively exploring the preference space, often converging prematurely to
suboptimal policies that satisfy only a narrow subset of human preferences. In
this work, we identify and address this preference exploration problem through
population-based methods. We demonstrate that maintaining a diverse population
of agents enables more comprehensive exploration of the preference landscape
compared to single-agent approaches. Crucially, this diversity improves reward
model learning by generating preference queries with clearly distinguishable
behaviors, a key factor in real-world scenarios where humans must easily
differentiate between options to provide meaningful feedback. Our experiments
reveal that current methods may fail by getting stuck in local optima,
requiring excessive feedback, or degrading significantly when human evaluators
make errors on similar trajectories, a realistic scenario often overlooked by
methods relying on perfect oracle teachers. Our population-based approach
demonstrates robust performance when teachers mislabel similar trajectory
segments and shows significantly enhanced preference exploration
capabilities,particularly in environments with complex reward landscapes.

Abstract: Digital technologies are increasingly used in education to reduce the

the LLMs leads to greater performance. Currently, available systems still need

Abstract: This paper introduces ChatbotManip, a novel dataset for studying manipulation

and a (simulated) user, where the chatbot is explicitly asked to showcase
manipulation tactics, persuade the user towards some goal, or simply be
helpful. We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from
consumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition
argumentation. Each conversation is annotated by human annotators for both
general manipulation and specific manipulation tactics. Our research reveals
three key findings. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulative
when explicitly instructed, with annotators identifying manipulation in
approximately 84\% of such conversations. Second, even when only instructed to
be ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently
default to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and
fear enhancement. Third, small fine-tuned open source models, such as
BERT+BiLSTM have a performance comparable to zero-shot classification with
larger models like Gemini 2.5 pro in detecting manipulation, but are not yet
reliable for real-world oversight. Our work provides important insights for AI
safety research and highlights the need of addressing manipulation risks as
LLMs are increasingly deployed in consumer-facing applications.

Motivation: Current digital twin approaches require fixed modelling environments and cannot adapt to new variables or information without re-design or re-training.

Method: Framing digital twinning as an in-context learning problem with large language models, using fine-tuned encoders for sample retrieval to enable dynamic adaptation.

Result: CALM-DT shows competitive performance compared to existing methods and can adapt to environmental changes without parameter updates.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of large language models in creating more flexible and adaptable digital twin systems.

Abstract: Digital twins are models of real-world systems that can simulate their
dynamics in response to potential actions. In complex settings, the state and
action variables, and available data and knowledge relevant to a system can
constantly change, requiring digital twins to continuously update with these
changes to remain relevant. Current approaches struggle in this regard, as they
require fixed, well-defined modelling environments, and they cannot adapt to
novel variables without re-designs, or incorporate new information without
re-training. To address this, we frame digital twinning as an in-context
learning problem using large language models, enabling seamless updates to the
twin at inference time. We develop CALM-DT, a Context-Adaptive Language
Model-based Digital Twin that can accurately simulate across diverse
state-action spaces using in-context learning alone by utilising fine-tuned
encoders for sample retrieval. We empirically demonstrate CALM-DT's competitive
performance with existing digital twin approaches, and its unique ability to
adapt to changes in its modelling environment without parameter updates.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of traffic accidents is essential for improving

incidents in Munich to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish
different types of accidents. The dataset consists of both structured tabular
features, such as location, time, and weather conditions, as well as
unstructured free-text descriptions detailing the circumstances of each
accident. Each incident is categorized into one of seven predefined classes. To
assess the reliability of these labels, we apply NLP methods, including topic
modeling and few-shot learning, which reveal inconsistencies in the labeling
process. These findings highlight potential ambiguities in accident
classification and motivate a refined predictive approach. Building on these
insights, we develop a classification model that achieves high accuracy in
assigning accidents to their respective categories. Our results demonstrate
that textual descriptions contain the most informative features for
classification, while the inclusion of tabular data provides only marginal
improvements. These findings emphasize the critical role of free-text data in
accident analysis and highlight the potential of transformer-based models in
improving classification reliability.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific information, e.g. sensitive or

contrastive decoding, leveraging two auxiliary smaller models, one trained

Method: CoPe uses reward-guided decoding after parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data to maximize implicit user rewards.

Result: CoPe improved personalization by 10.57% in ROUGE-L on five open-ended tasks without external reward models or extra training.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that decoding-time algorithms like CoPe can effectively personalize LLMs, highlighting their potential for future research and applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are progressively deployed in various
real-world applications, personalization of LLMs has become increasingly
important. While various approaches to LLM personalization such as prompt-based
and training-based methods have been actively explored, the development of
effective decoding-time algorithms remains largely overlooked, despite their
demonstrated potential. In this paper, we propose CoPe (Contrasting Personal
Preference), a novel decoding-time approach applied after performing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data. Our core idea is
to leverage reward-guided decoding specifically for personalization by
maximizing each user's implicit reward signal. We evaluate CoPe across five
open-ended personalized text generation tasks. Our empirical results
demonstrate that CoPe achieves strong performance, improving personalization by
an average of 10.57% in ROUGE-L, without relying on external reward models or
additional training procedures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The recent advent of reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 was met with excited
speculation by the AI community about the mechanisms underlying these
capabilities in closed models, followed by a rush of replication efforts,
particularly from the open source community. These speculations were largely
settled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and
reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base
LLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for
theoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying
mechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer
complementary benefits.
  Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and
cognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the
orchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive
operations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic
tool-calling framework. In particular, we endow an LLM with a small set of
"cognitive tools" encapsulating specific reasoning operations, each executed by
the LLM itself. Surprisingly, this simple strategy results in considerable
gains in performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to
base LLMs, for both closed and open-weight models. For instance, providing our
"cognitive tools" to GPT-4.1 increases its pass@1 performance on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 43.3%, bringing it very close to the performance of o1-preview.
  In addition to its practical implications, this demonstration contributes to
the debate regarding the role of post-training methods in eliciting reasoning
in LLMs versus the role of inherent capabilities acquired during pre-training,
and whether post-training merely uncovers these latent abilities.

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel approach to unsupervised document clustering
by leveraging multimodal embeddings as input to traditional clustering
algorithms such as $k$-Means and DBSCAN. Our method aims to achieve a
finer-grained document understanding by not only grouping documents at the type
level (e.g., invoices, purchase orders), but also distinguishing between
different templates within the same document category. This is achieved by
using embeddings that capture textual content, layout information, and visual
features of documents. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using
embeddings generated by several state-of-the-art pretrained multimodal models,
including SBERT, LayoutLMv1, LayoutLMv3, DiT, Donut, and ColPali. Our findings
demonstrate the potential of multimodal embeddings to significantly enhance
document clustering, offering benefits for various applications in intelligent
document processing, document layout analysis, and unsupervised document
classification. This work provides valuable insight into the advantages and
limitations of different multimodal models for this task and opens new avenues
for future research to understand and organize document collections.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models dramatically expand model capacity
and achieve remarkable performance without increasing per-token compute.
However, can MoEs surpass dense architectures under strictly equal resource
constraints - that is, when the total parameter count, training compute, and
data budget are identical? This question remains under-explored despite its
significant practical value and potential. In this paper, we propose a novel
perspective and methodological framework to study this question thoroughly.
First, we comprehensively investigate the architecture of MoEs and achieve an
optimal model design that maximizes the performance. Based on this, we
subsequently find that an MoE model with activation rate in an optimal region
is able to outperform its dense counterpart under the same total parameter,
training compute and data resource. More importantly, this optimal region
remains consistent across different model sizes. Although additional amount of
data turns out to be a trade-off for the enhanced performance, we show that
this can be resolved via reusing data. We validate our findings through
extensive experiments, training nearly 200 language models at 2B scale and over
50 at 7B scale, cumulatively processing 50 trillion tokens. All models will be
released publicly.

Motivation: Language changes over time, especially in hate speech, which evolves with social dynamics and cultural shifts. Current NLP research focuses on model training but overlooks the impact on model benchmarking, despite the importance of hate speech benchmarks for model safety.

Method: Empirical evaluation of 20 language models in two evolving hate speech experiments to assess robustness and identify temporal misalignment between static and time-sensitive evaluations.

Result: The study found temporal misalignment between static and time-sensitive evaluations of language models in hate speech detection, indicating that static benchmarks may not reliably assess model performance over time.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that time-sensitive linguistic benchmarks are necessary for accurate and reliable evaluation of language models in the hate speech domain.

Abstract: Language changes over time, including in the hate speech domain, which
evolves quickly following social dynamics and cultural shifts. While NLP

ensure model safety. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the robustness of
20 language models across two evolving hate speech experiments, and we show the
temporal misalignment between static and time-sensitive evaluations. Our

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Given a query and dataset, the optimal way of answering the query is to make
use all the information available. Modern LLMs exhibit impressive ability to
memorize training data, but data not deemed important during training is
forgotten, and information outside that training set cannot be made use of.
Processing an entire dataset at inference time is infeasible due to the bounded
nature of model resources (e.g. context size in transformers or states in state
space models), meaning we must resort to external memory. This constraint
naturally leads to the following problem: How can we decide based on the
present query and model, what among a virtually unbounded set of known data
matters for inference? To minimize model uncertainty for a particular query at
test-time, we introduce Retrieval In-Context Optimization (RICO), a retrieval
method that uses gradients from the LLM itself to learn the optimal mixture of
documents for answer generation. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), which relies on external heuristics for document retrieval,
our approach leverages direct feedback from the model. Theoretically, we show
that standard top-$k$ retrieval with model gradients can approximate our
optimization procedure, and provide connections to the leave-one-out loss. We
demonstrate empirically that by minimizing an unsupervised loss objective in
the form of question perplexity, we can achieve comparable retriever metric
performance to BM25 with \emph{no finetuning}. Furthermore, when evaluated on
quality of the final prediction, our method often outperforms fine-tuned dense
retrievers such as E5.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic
textual data for training smaller specialized models. However, a comparison of
various generation strategies for low-resource language settings is lacking.
While various prompting strategies have been proposed, such as demonstrations,
label-based summaries, and self-revision, their comparative effectiveness
remains unclear, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate the performance of these generation strategies and
their combinations across 11 typologically diverse languages, including several
extremely low-resource ones. Using three NLP tasks and four open-source LLMs,
we assess downstream model performance on generated versus gold-standard data.
Our results show that strategic combinations of generation methods,
particularly target-language demonstrations with LLM-based revisions, yield
strong performance, narrowing the gap with real data to as little as 5% in some
settings. We also find that smart prompting techniques can reduce the advantage
of larger LLMs, highlighting efficient generation strategies for synthetic data
generation in low-resource scenarios with smaller models.

Motivation: Adapting large language models to biomedical reasoning is challenging due to domain-specific complexity and limited supervision, necessitating effective strategies for improving their performance on medical QA tasks.

Method: The study compares standard instruction prompts and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts, using QLoRA for parameter-efficient instruction tuning across various model families and sizes.

Result: CoT prompting alone improves reasoning in zero-shot settings, while instruction tuning significantly boosts accuracy. However, fine-tuning on CoT prompts may degrade performance for larger models.

Conclusion: Reasoning-aware prompts are beneficial but their effectiveness depends on the model and its scale, providing practical insights for combining prompt engineering with efficient fine-tuning in medical QA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in medical question
answering (MedQA), yet adapting them to biomedical reasoning remains
challenging due to domain-specific complexity and limited supervision. In this
work, we study how prompt design and lightweight fine-tuning affect the
performance of open-source LLMs on PubMedQA, a benchmark for multiple-choice
biomedical questions. We focus on two widely used prompting strategies -
standard instruction prompts and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts - and apply
QLoRA for parameter-efficient instruction tuning. Across multiple model
families and sizes, our experiments show that CoT prompting alone can improve
reasoning in zero-shot settings, while instruction tuning significantly boosts
accuracy. However, fine-tuning on CoT prompts does not universally enhance
performance and may even degrade it for certain larger models. These findings
suggest that reasoning-aware prompts are useful, but their benefits are model-
and scale-dependent. Our study offers practical insights into combining prompt
engineering with efficient finetuning for medical QA applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications. As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and
underlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model
personality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with
diverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific
discoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking
key events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires
reasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small
models like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as
Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another
LLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection
and classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits:
for instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal
dynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When
analyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual
framing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors
step-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability,
making them user-friendly for a wide range of diverse applications.

Abstract: Language models are trained mainly on massive text data from the Internet,
and it becomes increasingly important to understand this data source.
Exact-match search engines enable searching in large text corpora -- counting
string appearances and retrieving the enclosing documents -- yet the high
storage overhead hinders their application on Internet-scale data. We present
Infini-gram mini, an efficient and scalable system that can make petabyte-level
text corpora searchable. Based on the FM-index data structure (Ferragina and
Manzini, 2000), which simultaneously indexes and compresses text, our system
creates indexes with size only 44% of the corpus. Infini-gram mini greatly
improves upon the best existing implementation of FM-index in terms of indexing
speed (18$\times$) and memory use during both indexing (3.2$\times$ reduction)
and querying (down to a negligible amount). We index 46TB of Internet text in
50 days with a single 128-core CPU node (or 19 hours if using 75 such nodes).
We show one important use case of Infini-gram mini in a large-scale analysis of
benchmark contamination. We find several core LM evaluation benchmarks to be
heavily contaminated in Internet crawls (up to 40% in SQuAD), which could lead
to overestimating the capabilities of language models if trained on such data.
We host a benchmark contamination bulletin to share the contamination rate of
many core and community-contributed benchmarks. We also release a web interface
and an API endpoint to serve general search queries on Infini-gram mini
indexes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as research tools
in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science (HPSS). LLMs are
remarkably effective at processing unstructured text and inferring meaning from
context, offering new affordances that challenge long-standing divides between
computational and interpretive methods. This raises both opportunities and
challenges for HPSS, which emphasizes interpretive methodologies and
understands meaning as context-dependent, ambiguous, and historically situated.
We argue that HPSS is uniquely positioned not only to benefit from LLMs'
capabilities but also to interrogate their epistemic assumptions and
infrastructural implications. To this end, we first offer a concise primer on
LLM architectures and training paradigms tailored to non-technical readers. We
frame LLMs not as neutral tools but as epistemic infrastructures that encode
assumptions about meaning, context, and similarity, conditioned by their
training data, architecture, and patterns of use. We then examine how
computational techniques enhanced by LLMs, such as structuring data, detecting
patterns, and modeling dynamic processes, can be applied to support
interpretive research in HPSS. Our analysis compares full-context and
generative models, outlines strategies for domain and task adaptation (e.g.,
continued pretraining, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation), and
evaluates their respective strengths and limitations for interpretive inquiry
in HPSS. We conclude with four lessons for integrating LLMs into HPSS: (1)
model selection involves interpretive trade-offs; (2) LLM literacy is
foundational; (3) HPSS must define its own benchmarks and corpora; and (4) LLMs
should enhance, not replace, interpretive methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have significantly impacted
Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODS) but continue to face notable performance
challenges, especially in zero-shot scenarios. While prior work has noted this
performance gap, the behavioral factors driving the performance gap remain
under-explored. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework to
quantify the behavior gap between AI agents and human experts, focusing on
discrepancies in dialog acts, tool usage, and knowledge utilization. Our
findings reveal that this behavior gap is a critical factor negatively
impacting the performance of LLM agents. Notably, as task complexity increases,
the behavior gap widens (correlation: 0.963), leading to a degradation of agent
performance on complex task-oriented dialogs. For the most complex task in our
study, even the GPT-4o-based agent exhibits low alignment with human behavior,
with low F1 scores for dialog acts (0.464), excessive and often misaligned tool
usage with a F1 score of 0.139, and ineffective usage of external knowledge.
Reducing such behavior gaps leads to significant performance improvement (24.3%
on average). This study highlights the importance of comprehensive behavioral
evaluations and improved alignment strategies to enhance the effectiveness of
LLM-based TODS in handling complex tasks.

Abstract: Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks,

complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for
delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress
in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their
ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely
unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust
reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from
MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure
large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward
functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With
multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and
verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly
improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing
even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1
demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.
Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain
length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. The code will be released.

Abstract: Real-time text-to-speech (TTS) for Modern Hebrew is challenging due to the

data for TTS systems. Our results demonstrate that Phonikud G2P conversion more
accurately predicts phonemes from Hebrew text compared to prior methods, and
that this enables training of effective real-time Hebrew TTS models with
superior speed-accuracy trade-offs. We release our code, data, and models at

Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in evaluating intersectional bias in LLMs, as existing studies focus on single social attributes rather than the complex, intersecting forms of bias identified in social science.

Method: The method involves constructing the inter-JBBQ benchmark to test intersectional bias in LLMs within a question-answering framework.

Result: The results show that intersectional bias in LLMs like GPT-4o and Swallow varies depending on the context, even when social attributes are combined equally.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of considering intersectional bias in LLM evaluations and highlights the need for context-aware assessment frameworks.

Abstract: An growing number of studies have examined the social bias of rapidly
developed large language models (LLMs). Although most of these studies have
focused on bias occurring in a single social attribute, research in social
science has shown that social bias often occurs in the form of
intersectionality -- the constitutive and contextualized perspective on bias
aroused by social attributes. In this study, we construct the Japanese
benchmark inter-JBBQ, designed to evaluate the intersectional bias in LLMs on
the question-answering setting. Using inter-JBBQ to analyze GPT-4o and Swallow,
we find that biased output varies according to its contexts even with the equal
combination of social attributes.

examples, simply increasing the number of demonstrations does not guarantee
improved performance. Smart ICL selection remains crucial, even with thousands

ICL, a novel ICL selection algorithm specifically designed to focus LLM
attention on challenging examples by strategically repeating them within the
context and incorporating zero-shot predictions as error signals. Our results
show that Refract ICL significantly improves the performance of extremely

Abstract: While recent advances in large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable
performance, efficient reasoning remains critical due to the rapid growth of
output length. Existing optimization approaches highlights a tendency toward
"overthinking", yet lack fine-grained analysis. In this work, we focus on
Self-Affirmation Reflections: redundant reflective steps that affirm prior
content and often occurs after the already correct reasoning steps.
Observations of both original and optimized reasoning models reveal pervasive
self-affirmation reflections. Notably, these reflections sometimes lead to
longer outputs in optimized models than their original counterparts. Through
detailed analysis, we uncover an intriguing pattern: compared to other
reflections, the leading words (i.e., the first word of sentences) in
self-affirmation reflections exhibit a distinct probability bias. Motivated by
this insight, we can locate self-affirmation reflections and conduct a
train-free experiment demonstrating that suppressing self-affirmation
reflections reduces output length without degrading accuracy across multiple
models (R1-Distill-Models, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3-32B). Furthermore, we also
improve current train-based method by explicitly suppressing such reflections.
In our experiments, we achieve length compression of 18.7\% in train-free
settings and 50.2\% in train-based settings for R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Moreover,
our improvements are simple yet practical and can be directly applied to
existing inference frameworks, such as vLLM. We believe that our findings will
provide community insights for achieving more precise length compression and
step-level efficient reasoning.

research will focus on enhancing models ability to handle multiple input,
thereby making them more intelligent, safe, and reliable.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are useful for analyzing social structures, community
dynamics, institutional memberships, and other complex relationships across
domains from sociology to public health. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) have improved the scalability and accessibility of
automated KG extraction from large text corpora, the impacts of extraction
errors on downstream analyses are poorly understood, especially for applied
scientists who depend on accurate KGs for real-world insights. To address this
gap, we conducted the first evaluation of KG extraction performance at two
levels: (1) micro-level edge accuracy, which is consistent with standard NLP
evaluations, and manual identification of common error sources; (2) macro-level
graph metrics that assess structural properties such as community detection and
connectivity, which are relevant to real-world applications. Focusing on
affiliation graphs of person membership in organizations extracted from social
register books, our study identifies a range of extraction performance where
biases across most downstream graph analysis metrics are near zero. However, as
extraction performance declines, we find that many metrics exhibit increasingly
pronounced biases, with each metric tending toward a consistent direction of
either over- or under-estimation. Through simulations, we further show that
error models commonly used in the literature do not capture these bias
patterns, indicating the need for more realistic error models for KG
extraction. Our findings provide actionable insights for practitioners and
underscores the importance of advancing extraction methods and error modeling
to ensure reliable and meaningful downstream analyses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The release of
open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Qwen has triggered the development of numerous
fine-tuned models tailored for various tasks and languages. In this paper, we
explore an important question: is it possible to combine these specialized
models to create a unified model with multi-task capabilities. We introduces
Hierarchical Iterative Merging (Hi-Merging), a training-free method for
unifying different specialized LLMs into a single model. Specifically,
Hi-Merging employs model-wise and layer-wise pruning and scaling, guided by
contribution analysis, to mitigate parameter conflicts. Extensive experiments
on multiple-choice and question-answering tasks in both Chinese and English
validate Hi-Merging's ability for multi-task learning. The results demonstrate
that Hi-Merging consistently outperforms existing merging techniques and
surpasses the performance of models fine-tuned on combined datasets in most
scenarios. Code is available at:

Abstract: The explosive growth of scientific publications has created an urgent need
for automated methods that facilitate knowledge synthesis and hypothesis
generation. Literature-based discovery (LBD) addresses this challenge by
uncovering previously unknown associations between disparate domains. This
article surveys recent methodological advances in LBD, focusing on developments
from 2000 to the present. We review progress in three key areas: knowledge
graph construction, deep learning approaches, and the integration of
pre-trained and large language models (LLMs). While LBD has made notable
progress, several fundamental challenges remain unresolved, particularly
concerning scalability, reliance on structured data, and the need for extensive
manual curation. By examining ongoing advances and outlining promising future
directions, this survey underscores the transformative role of LLMs in
enhancing LBD and aims to support researchers and practitioners in harnessing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of inferior performance in multilingual LLMs caused by limited capacity and negative transfer between dissimilar languages.

Method: Dynamically group and scale up parameters of multilingual LLMs, using mixture-of-experts layers for languages with high deviation, where each expert handles a group of similar languages.

Result: The method reduces negative transfer, boosts multilingual performance, and requires fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Language group specialization through experts enhances new language adaptation and reduces reliance on prior multilingual knowledge.

Abstract: The curse of multilinguality phenomenon is a fundamental problem of
multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), where the competition between
massive languages results in inferior performance. It mainly comes from limited
capacity and negative transfer between dissimilar languages. To address this
issue, we propose a method to dynamically group and scale up the parameters of
multilingual LLM while boosting positive transfer among similar languages.
Specifically, the model is first tuned on monolingual corpus to determine the
parameter deviation in each layer and quantify the similarity between
languages. Layers with more deviations are extended to mixture-of-experts
layers to reduce competition between languages, where one expert module serves
one group of similar languages. Experimental results on 18 to 128 languages
show that our method reduces the negative transfer between languages and
significantly boosts multilingual performance with fewer parameters. Such
language group specialization on experts benefits the new language adaptation
and reduces the inference on the previous multilingual knowledge learned.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across many tasks,
but their ability to capture culturally diverse moral values remains unclear.
In this paper, we examine whether LLMs can mirror variations in moral attitudes
reported by two major cross-cultural surveys: the World Values Survey and the
PEW Research Center's Global Attitudes Survey. We compare smaller, monolingual,
and multilingual models (GPT-2, OPT, BLOOMZ, and Qwen) with more recent
instruction-tuned models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemma-2-9b-it, and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct). Using log-probability-based moral justifiability
scores, we correlate each model's outputs with survey data covering a broad set
of ethical topics. Our results show that many earlier or smaller models often
produce near-zero or negative correlations with human judgments. In contrast,
advanced instruction-tuned models (including GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) achieve
substantially higher positive correlations, suggesting they better reflect
real-world moral attitudes. While scaling up model size and using instruction
tuning can improve alignment with cross-cultural moral norms, challenges remain
for certain topics and regions. We discuss these findings in relation to bias
analysis, training data diversity, and strategies for improving the cultural
sensitivity of LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Inference-time alignment methods have gained significant attention for their
efficiency and effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences. However, existing dominant approaches using reward-guided
search (RGS) primarily rely on outcome reward models (ORMs), which suffer from
a critical granularity mismatch: ORMs are designed to provide outcome rewards
for complete responses, while RGS methods rely on process rewards to guide the
policy, leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal alignment. To address
this challenge, we introduce process reward models (PRMs) into RGS and argue
that an ideal PRM should satisfy two objectives: Score Consistency, ensuring
coherent evaluation across partial and complete responses, and Preference
Consistency, aligning partial sequence assessments with human preferences.
Based on these, we propose SP-PRM, a novel dual-consistency framework
integrating score consistency-based and preference consistency-based partial
evaluation modules without relying on human annotation. Extensive experiments
on dialogue, summarization, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that SP-PRM
substantially enhances existing RGS methods, achieving a 3.6%-10.3% improvement
in GPT-4 evaluation scores across all tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across tasks and languages, revolutionizing natural language
processing. This paper investigates the naturally emerging representation
alignment in LLMs, particularly in the middle layers, and its implications for
disentangling language-specific and language-agnostic information. We
empirically confirm the existence of this alignment, analyze its behavior in
comparison to explicitly designed alignment models, and demonstrate its
potential for language-specific manipulation without semantic degradation.
Building on these findings, we propose Inference-Time Language Control (ITLC),
a novel method that leverages latent injection to enable precise cross-lingual
language control and mitigate language confusion in LLMs. Our experiments
highlight ITLC's strong cross-lingual control capabilities while preserving
semantic integrity in target languages. Furthermore, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in alleviating the cross-lingual language confusion problem,
which persists even in current large-scale LLMs, leading to inconsistent
language generation. This work advances our understanding of representation
alignment in LLMs and introduces a practical solution for enhancing their
cross-lingual performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) aims to extract semantic relationships in texts from
given entity pairs, and has achieved significant improvements. However, in
different domains, the RE task can be influenced by various factors. For
example, in the financial domain, sentiment can affect RE results, yet this
factor has been overlooked by modern RE models. To address this gap, this paper
proposes a Sentiment-aware-SDP-Enhanced-Module (SSDP-SEM), a multi-task
learning approach for enhancing financial RE. Specifically, SSDP-SEM integrates
the RE models with a pluggable auxiliary sentiment perception (ASP) task,
enabling the RE models to concurrently navigate their attention weights with
the text's sentiment. We first generate detailed sentiment tokens through a
sentiment model and insert these tokens into an instance. Then, the ASP task
focuses on capturing nuanced sentiment information through predicting the
sentiment token positions, combining both sentiment insights and the Shortest
Dependency Path (SDP) of syntactic information. Moreover, this work employs a
sentiment attention information bottleneck regularization method to regulate
the reasoning process. Our experiment integrates this auxiliary task with
several prevalent frameworks, and the results demonstrate that most previous
models benefit from the auxiliary task, thereby achieving better results. These
findings highlight the importance of effectively leveraging sentiment in the
financial RE task.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) succeed in many natural language processing
tasks. However, their tendency to hallucinate - generate plausible but
inconsistent or factually incorrect text - can cause problems in certain tasks,
including response generation in dialogue. To mitigate this issue,
knowledge-augmented methods have shown promise in reducing hallucinations.
Here, we introduce a novel framework designed to enhance the factuality of
dialogue response generation, as well as an approach to evaluate dialogue
factual accuracy. Our framework combines a knowledge triple retriever, a
dialogue rewrite, and knowledge-enhanced response generation to produce more
accurate and grounded dialogue responses. To further evaluate generated
responses, we propose a revised fact score that addresses the limitations of
existing fact-score methods in dialogue settings, providing a more reliable
assessment of factual consistency. We evaluate our methods using different
baselines on the OpendialKG and HybriDialogue datasets. Our methods
significantly improve factuality compared to other graph knowledge-augmentation
baselines, including the state-of-the-art G-retriever. The code will be
released on GitHub.

Abstract: Numerous studies have proposed computational methods to detect hate speech

In this study, we evaluate the counterfactual fairness of hate speech detection
models in the Dutch language, specifically examining the performance and
fairness of transformer-based models. We make the following key contributions.
First, we curate a list of Dutch Social Group Terms that reflect social
context. Second, we generate counterfactual data for Dutch hate speech using
LLMs and established strategies like Manual Group Substitution (MGS) and
Sentence Log-Likelihood (SLL). Through qualitative evaluation, we highlight the
challenges of generating realistic counterfactuals, particularly with Dutch
grammar and contextual coherence. Third, we fine-tune baseline
transformer-based models with counterfactual data and evaluate their
performance in detecting hate speech. Fourth, we assess the fairness of these
models using Counterfactual Token Fairness (CTF) and group fairness metrics,
including equality of odds and demographic parity. Our analysis shows that
models perform better in terms of hate speech detection, average counterfactual
fairness and group fairness. This work addresses a significant gap in the
literature on counterfactual fairness for hate speech detection in Dutch and
provides practical insights and recommendations for improving both model
performance and fairness.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), they have
significantly improved efficiency across a wide range of domains. However,
recent studies have revealed that LLMs often exhibit gender bias, leading to
serious social implications. Detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias
in LLMs has therefore become a critical research focus. In the NLPCC 2025
Shared Task 7: Chinese Corpus for Gender Bias Detection, Classification and
Mitigation Challenge, we investigate how to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in
gender bias detection, classification, and mitigation. We adopt reinforcement
learning, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning to
handle different Subtasks. Specifically, for Subtasks 1 and 2, we leverage the
internal reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide multi-step thinking in a
staged manner, which simplifies complex biased queries and improves response
accuracy. For Subtask 3, we employ a reinforcement learning-based approach,
annotating a preference dataset using GPT-4. We then apply Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to mitigate gender bias by introducing a loss function that
explicitly favors less biased completions over biased ones. Our approach ranked
first across all three subtasks of the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7.

Abstract: Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech

effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this
work, we systematically investigate the impact of key components (i.e., speech
tokenizers, speech heads, and speaker modeling) on the performance of
LLM-centric SLMs. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled
speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled
tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address
the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce
multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode
multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a
substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we
propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a
large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker
identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge
understanding and speaker consistency.

Abstract: In an age characterized by the proliferation of mis- and disinformation
online, it is critical to empower readers to understand the content they are
reading. Important efforts in this direction rely on manual or automatic
fact-checking, which can be challenging for emerging claims with limited
information. Such scenarios can be handled by assessing the reliability and the
political bias of the source of the claim, i.e., characterizing entire news
outlets rather than individual claims or articles. This is an important but
understudied research direction. While prior work has looked into linguistic
and social contexts, we do not analyze individual articles or information in
social media. Instead, we propose a novel methodology that emulates the
criteria that professional fact-checkers use to assess the factuality and
political bias of an entire outlet. Specifically, we design a variety of
prompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models
(LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating
sizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with
multiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media
popularity and region on model performance. Further, we conduct an ablation

high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG
addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting,
dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and

embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we
create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana
setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG
improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG
pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves
a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight
DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast,

Abstract: As natural language processing for gender bias becomes a significant
interdisciplinary topic, the prevalent data-driven techniques, such as
pre-trained language models, suffer from biased corpus. This case becomes more
obvious regarding those languages with less fairness-related computational
linguistic resources, such as Chinese. To this end, we propose a Chinese cOrpus
foR Gender bIas Probing and Mitigation (CORGI-PM), which contains 32.9k
sentences with high-quality labels derived by following an annotation scheme
specifically developed for gender bias in the Chinese context. It is worth
noting that CORGI-PM contains 5.2k gender-biased sentences along with the
corresponding bias-eliminated versions rewritten by human annotators. We pose
three challenges as a shared task to automate the mitigation of textual gender
bias, which requires the models to detect, classify, and mitigate textual
gender bias. In the literature, we present the results and analysis for the
teams participating this shared task in NLPCC 2025.

Abstract: Recent work shows that Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) applied to large language

SAE neurons can be modified to align generated outputs, but only towards
pre-identified topics and with some parameter tuning. Our approach leverages
the observational and modification properties of SAEs to enable alignment for
any topic. This method 1) scores each SAE neuron by its semantic similarity to
an alignment text and uses them to 2) modify SAE-layer-level outputs by
emphasizing topic-aligned neurons. We assess the alignment capabilities of this
approach on diverse public topic datasets including Amazon reviews, Medicine,
and Sycophancy, across the currently available open-source LLMs and SAE pairs
(GPT2 and Gemma) with multiple SAEs configurations. Experiments aligning to
medical prompts reveal several benefits over fine-tuning, including increased
average language acceptability (0.25 vs. 0.5), reduced training time across
multiple alignment topics (333.6s vs. 62s), and acceptable inference time for
many applications (+0.00092s/token). Our open-source code is available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress on
reasoning tasks involving unstructured text, yet their capabilities
significantly deteriorate when reasoning requires integrating structured
external knowledge such as knowledge graphs, code snippets, or formal logic.
This limitation is partly due to the absence of benchmarks capable of
systematically evaluating LLM performance across diverse structured knowledge
modalities. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{OneEval}}, a
comprehensive benchmark explicitly designed to assess the knowledge-intensive
reasoning capabilities of LLMs across four structured knowledge modalities,
unstructured text, knowledge graphs, code, and formal logic, and five critical
domains (general knowledge, government, science, law, and programming).
\textsc{OneEval} comprises 4,019 carefully curated instances and includes a
challenging subset, \textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}, consisting of 1,285
particularly difficult cases. Through extensive evaluation of 18
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, we establish three core
findings: a) \emph{persistent limitations in structured reasoning}, with even
the strongest model achieving only 32.2\% accuracy on
\textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}; b) \emph{performance consistently
declines as the structural complexity of the knowledge base increases}, with
accuracy dropping sharply from 53\% (textual reasoning) to 25\% (formal logic);
and c) \emph{diminishing returns from extended reasoning chains}, highlighting
the critical need for models to adapt reasoning depth appropriately to task
complexity. We release the \textsc{OneEval} datasets, evaluation scripts, and
baseline results publicly, accompanied by a leaderboard to facilitate ongoing
advancements in structured knowledge reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper explores Mamba-based HuBERT models as alternatives to Transformer-based SSL architectures, showing potential in long-context ASR, streaming ASR, and SUPERB benchmarks with higher-quality representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the potential of Mamba in speech self-supervised learning, as prior studies have been limited to isolated tasks.

Method: The method involves exploring Mamba-based HuBERT models, leveraging their linear-time Selective State Space for fine-tuning on long-context ASR and streaming ASR.

Result: The results show that Mamba-based SSL models yield higher-quality quantized representations and capture speaker-related features more distinctly than Transformers, with competitive performance on SUPERB benchmarks.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that Mamba-based SSL is a promising direction for long-sequence modeling, real-time speech modeling, and speech unit extraction.

Abstract: While Mamba has demonstrated strong performance in language modeling, its
potential as a speech self-supervised (SSL) model remains underexplored, with
prior studies limited to isolated tasks. To address this, we explore
Mamba-based HuBERT models as alternatives to Transformer-based SSL
architectures. Leveraging the linear-time Selective State Space, these models
enable fine-tuning on long-context ASR with significantly lower compute.
Moreover, they show superior performance when fine-tuned for streaming ASR.
Beyond fine-tuning, these models show competitive performance on SUPERB probing
benchmarks, particularly in causal settings. Our analysis shows that they yield
higher-quality quantized representations and capture speaker-related features
more distinctly than Transformer-based models. These findings highlight
Mamba-based SSL as a promising and complementary direction for long-sequence
modeling, real-time speech modeling, and speech unit extraction.

Abstract: In this work we focus on improving language models' understanding for asset
maintenance to guide the engineer's decisions and minimize asset downtime.
Given a set of tasks expressed in natural language for Industry 4.0 domain,
each associated with queries related to a specific asset, we want to recommend
relevant items and generalize to queries of similar assets. A task may involve
identifying relevant sensors given a query about an asset's failure mode.
  Our approach begins with gathering a qualitative, expert-vetted knowledge
base to construct nine asset-specific task datasets. To create more
contextually informed embeddings, we augment the input tasks using Large
Language Models (LLMs), providing concise descriptions of the entities involved
in the queries. This embedding model is then integrated with a Reasoning and
Acting agent (ReAct), which serves as a powerful tool for answering complex
user queries that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and knowledge
inference.
  Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that: (a) LLM query augmentation
improves the quality of embeddings, (b) Contrastive loss and other methods that
avoid in-batch negatives are superior for datasets with queries related to many
items, and (c) It is crucial to balance positive and negative in-batch samples.
After training and testing on our dataset, we observe a substantial
improvement: HIT@1 increases by +54.2%, MAP@100 by +50.1%, and NDCG@10 by
+54.7%, averaged across all tasks and models. Additionally, we empirically
demonstrate the model's planning and tool invocation capabilities when
answering complex questions related to industrial asset maintenance, showcasing
its effectiveness in supporting Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their
day-to-day operations.

Abstract: We introduce Konooz, a novel multi-dimensional corpus covering 16 Arabic
dialects across 10 domains, resulting in 160 distinct corpora. The corpus
comprises about 777k tokens, carefully collected and manually annotated with 21
entity types using both nested and flat annotation schemes - using the Wojood
guidelines. While Konooz is useful for various NLP tasks like domain adaptation
and transfer learning, this paper primarily focuses on benchmarking existing
Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, especially cross-domain and
cross-dialect model performance. Our benchmarking of four Arabic NER models
using Konooz reveals a significant drop in performance of up to 38% when
compared to the in-distribution data. Furthermore, we present an in-depth
analysis of domain and dialect divergence and the impact of resource scarcity.
We also measured the overlap between domains and dialects using the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric, and illustrated why certain NER models perform
better on specific dialects and domains. Konooz is open-source and publicly

Abstract: Robust unlearning is crucial for safely deploying large language models
(LLMs) in environments where data privacy, model safety, and regulatory
compliance must be ensured. Yet the task is inherently challenging, partly due
to difficulties in reliably measuring whether unlearning has truly occurred.
Moreover, fragmentation in current methodologies and inconsistent evaluation
metrics hinder comparative analysis and reproducibility. To unify and
accelerate research efforts, we introduce OpenUnlearning, a standardized and
extensible framework designed explicitly for benchmarking both LLM unlearning
methods and metrics. OpenUnlearning integrates 9 unlearning algorithms and 16
diverse evaluations across 3 leading benchmarks (TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP) and also
enables analyses of forgetting behaviors across 450+ checkpoints we publicly
release. Leveraging OpenUnlearning, we propose a novel meta-evaluation
benchmark focused specifically on assessing the faithfulness and robustness of
evaluation metrics themselves. We also benchmark diverse unlearning methods and
provide a comparative analysis against an extensive evaluation suite. Overall,
we establish a clear, community-driven pathway toward rigorous development in
LLM unlearning research.

Abstract: Artistic inspiration often emerges from language that is open to
interpretation. This paper explores the use of AI-generated poetic lines as
stimuli for creativity. Through analysis of two generative AI approaches--lines
generated by Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoders (LSTM-VAE) and
complete poems by Large Language Models (LLMs)--I demonstrate that LSTM-VAE
lines achieve their evocative impact through a combination of resonant imagery
and productive indeterminacy. While LLMs produce technically accomplished
poetry with conventional patterns, LSTM-VAE lines can engage the artist through
semantic openness, unconventional combinations, and fragments that resist
closure. Through the composition of an original poem, where narrative emerged
organically through engagement with LSTM-VAE generated lines rather than
following a predetermined structure, I demonstrate how these characteristics
can serve as evocative starting points for authentic artistic expression.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Wikipedia's reliability by introducing PeopleProfiles, a dataset showing 20% of lead claims are unsupported, 27% of body claims lack cited source support, and over 80% of lead claims can't be traced via body evidence. It also finds standard retrieval methods struggle with complex evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia is a key resource for NLP, but its reliability depends on claims being supported by citations. This paper aims to quantify how well Wikipedia is grounded in its sources and how easily evidence can be retrieved.

Method: The authors created PeopleProfiles, a large dataset with claim support annotations for Wikipedia articles about notable people. They analyzed claim support in lead sections and article bodies, checking against cited sources.

Result: 20% of lead section claims are unsupported by the article body; 27% of body claims lack support from public sources; over 80% of lead claims can't be linked to sources via body evidence. Standard retrieval methods have difficulty finding complex evidence.

Conclusion: Wikipedia's reliability as an NLP resource is compromised by insufficient grounding. Improving evidence retrieval methods is necessary for better trustworthiness.

Abstract: Wikipedia is a critical resource for modern NLP, serving as a rich repository
of up-to-date and citation-backed information on a wide variety of subjects.
The reliability of Wikipedia -- its groundedness in its cited sources -- is
vital to this purpose. This work provides a quantitative analysis of the extent
to which Wikipedia *is* so grounded and of how readily grounding evidence may
be retrieved. To this end, we introduce PeopleProfiles -- a large-scale,
multi-level dataset of claim support annotations on Wikipedia articles of
notable people. We show that roughly 20% of claims in Wikipedia *lead* sections
are unsupported by the article body; roughly 27% of annotated claims in the
article *body* are unsupported by their (publicly accessible) cited sources;
and >80% of lead claims cannot be traced to these sources via annotated body
evidence. Further, we show that recovery of complex grounding evidence for
claims that *are* supported remains a challenge for standard retrieval methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are used in morally sensitive domains, understanding how persona traits affect their moral reasoning and persuasion is crucial.

Method: The study uses a 6-dimensional persona space (age, gender, country, class, ideology, personality) to simulate structured debates between AI agents over 131 relationship-based cases.

Result: Personas influence initial moral stances and debate outcomes, with political ideology and personality traits having the strongest effect. Liberal and open personalities achieve higher consensus and win rates.

Conclusion: The findings suggest the importance of developing persona-aware evaluation frameworks for AI moral reasoning, as the trends align with psychological and cultural studies.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in morally sensitive
domains, it is crucial to understand how persona traits affect their moral
reasoning and persuasive behavior. We present the first large-scale study of
multi-dimensional persona effects in AI-AI debates over real-world moral
dilemmas. Using a 6-dimensional persona space (age, gender, country, class,
ideology, and personality), we simulate structured debates between AI agents
over 131 relationship-based cases. Our results show that personas affect
initial moral stances and debate outcomes, with political ideology and
personality traits exerting the strongest influence. Persuasive success varies
across traits, with liberal and open personalities reaching higher consensus
and win rates. While logit-based confidence grows during debates, emotional and
credibility-based appeals diminish, indicating more tempered argumentation over
time. These trends mirror findings from psychology and cultural studies,
reinforcing the need for persona-aware evaluation frameworks for AI moral
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical foundation models are often trained on de-identified text with masked protected health information, but the impact of this training method is not well understood.

Method: Pretrained encoder-only models on redacted text and replaced pseudo text, then fine-tuned for PHID task.

Result: Our methods significantly outperform previous baselines in PHID tasks.

Conclusion: Training on redacted text with realistic pseudo replacements can enhance model performance, and the dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Many models are pretrained on redacted text for privacy reasons. Clinical
foundation models are often trained on de-identified text, which uses special
syntax (masked) text in place of protected health information. Even though
these models have increased in popularity, there has been little effort in
understanding the effects of training them on redacted text. In this work, we
pretrain several encoder-only models on a dataset that contains redacted text
and a version with replaced realistic pseudo text. We then fine-tuned models
for the protected health information de-identification task and show how our
methods significantly outperform previous baselines. The contributions of this
work include: a) our novel, and yet surprising findings with training
recommendations, b) redacted text replacements used to produce the pseudo
dataset, c) pretrained embeddings and fine-tuned task specific models, and d)
freely available pseudo training dataset generation and model source code used
in our experiments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Realignment becomes necessary when a language model (LM) fails to meet
expected performance. We propose a flexible realignment framework that supports
quantitative control of alignment degree during training and inference. This
framework incorporates Training-time Realignment (TrRa), which efficiently
realigns the reference model by leveraging the controllable fusion of logits
from both the reference and already aligned models. For example, TrRa reduces
token usage by 54.63% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B without any performance
degradation, outperforming DeepScaleR-1.5B's 33.86%. To complement TrRa during
inference, we introduce a layer adapter that enables smooth Inference-time
Realignment (InRa). This adapter is initialized to perform an identity
transformation at the bottom layer and is inserted preceding the original
layers. During inference, input embeddings are simultaneously processed by the
adapter and the original layer, followed by the remaining layers, and then
controllably interpolated at the logit level. We upgraded
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from a slow-thinking model to one that supports
both fast and slow thinking, allowing flexible alignment control even during
inference. By encouraging deeper reasoning, it even surpassed its original
performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces IndoHateMix, a dataset for hate speech detection in Hindi-English code-mixing, showing that LLMs outperform BERT models with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection on social media is challenging due to linguistic diversity, code-mixing, transliteration, and cultural nuances. Current NLP methods struggle in these multilingual scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces IndoHateMix, a dataset capturing Hindi-English code-mixing and transliteration. It compares LLMs like LLaMA-3.1 with BERT-based models in hate speech detection.

Result: LLMs outperform BERT models even when fine-tuned on less data, demonstrating better generalization and adaptability in multilingual hate speech detection.

Conclusion: LLMs could be a transformative approach for mitigating online hate, suggesting future research should focus on dataset curation rather than specialized models.

Abstract: Hate speech detection across contemporary social media presents unique
challenges due to linguistic diversity and the informal nature of online
discourse. These challenges are further amplified in settings involving
code-mixing, transliteration, and culturally nuanced expressions. While
fine-tuned transformer models, such as BERT, have become standard for this
task, we argue that recent large language models (LLMs) not only surpass them
but also redefine the landscape of hate speech detection more broadly. To
support this claim, we introduce IndoHateMix, a diverse, high-quality dataset
capturing Hindi-English code-mixing and transliteration in the Indian context,
providing a realistic benchmark to evaluate model robustness in complex
multilingual scenarios where existing NLP methods often struggle. Our extensive
experiments show that cutting-edge LLMs (such as LLaMA-3.1) consistently
outperform task-specific BERT-based models, even when fine-tuned on
significantly less data. With their superior generalization and adaptability,
LLMs offer a transformative approach to mitigating online hate in diverse
environments. This raises the question of whether future works should
prioritize developing specialized models or focus on curating richer and more
varied datasets to further enhance the effectiveness of LLMs.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into everyday
life and information ecosystems, concerns about their implicit biases continue
to persist. While prior work has primarily examined socio-demographic and
left--right political dimensions, little attention has been paid to how LLMs
align with broader geopolitical value systems, particularly the
democracy--authoritarianism spectrum. In this paper, we propose a novel
methodology to assess such alignment, combining (1) the F-scale, a psychometric
tool for measuring authoritarian tendencies, (2) FavScore, a newly introduced
metric for evaluating model favorability toward world leaders, and (3)
role-model probing to assess which figures are cited as general role-models by
LLMs. We find that LLMs generally favor democratic values and leaders, but
exhibit increases favorability toward authoritarian figures when prompted in
Mandarin. Further, models are found to often cite authoritarian figures as role
models, even outside explicit political contexts. These results shed light on
ways LLMs may reflect and potentially reinforce global political ideologies,
highlighting the importance of evaluating bias beyond conventional
socio-political axes. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: This paper proposes Surprise Calibration (SC) to address biases in in-context learning (ICL) by using implicit sequential Bayesian inference and leveraging surprise as a signal for class prior shifts, showing superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the issue of biases in ICL caused by prior knowledge and contextual demonstrations, which can negatively impact LLMs' performance, especially in dynamic settings where contexts vary per query.

Method: The method involves using implicit sequential Bayesian inference to interpret ICL, identifying surprise as a signal for class prior shifts, and introducing SC as a novel calibration method that adapts to temporal dynamics of class priors.

Result: The result shows that SC outperforms existing bias calibration techniques in various NLP benchmark tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in dynamic ICL settings.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that SC provides a more adaptive and computationally efficient solution for in-context learning by effectively capturing class prior shifts through the concept of surprise.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for task
adaptation in large language models (LLMs), where models infer underlying task
structures from a few demonstrations. However, ICL remains susceptible to
biases that arise from prior knowledge and contextual demonstrations, which can
degrade the performance of LLMs. Existing bias calibration methods typically
apply fixed class priors across all inputs, limiting their efficacy in dynamic
ICL settings where the context for each query differs. To address these
limitations, we adopt implicit sequential Bayesian inference as a framework for
interpreting ICL, identify "surprise" as an informative signal for class prior
shift, and introduce a novel method--Surprise Calibration (SC). SC leverages
the notion of surprise to capture the temporal dynamics of class priors,
providing a more adaptive and computationally efficient solution for in-context
learning. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of SC over existing bias
calibration techniques across a range of benchmark natural language processing
tasks.

Abstract: Due to advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, the boundary
between human-written text and AI-generated text has become blurred.
Nevertheless, recent work has demonstrated that it is possible to reliably
detect GPT-generated text. In this paper, we adopt a novel strategy to
adversarially transform GPT-generated text using sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
models, with the goal of making the text more human-like. We experiment with
the Seq2Seq models T5-small and BART which serve to modify GPT-generated
sentences to include linguistic, structural, and semantic components that may
be more typical of human-authored text. Experiments show that classification
models trained to distinguish GPT-generated text are significantly less
accurate when tested on text that has been modified by these Seq2Seq models.
However, after retraining classification models on data generated by our
Seq2Seq technique, the models are able to distinguish the transformed
GPT-generated text from human-generated text with high accuracy. This work adds
to the accumulating knowledge of text transformation as a tool for both attack
-- in the sense of defeating classification models -- and defense -- in the
sense of improved classifiers -- thereby advancing our understanding of
AI-generated text.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning models have
improved performance on complex tasks, but they suffer from overthinking, which
generates redundant reasoning steps, especially for simple questions. This
paper revisits the reasoning patterns of Long and Short CoT models, observing
that the Short CoT patterns offer concise reasoning efficiently, while the Long
CoT patterns excel in challenging scenarios where the Short CoT patterns
struggle. To enable models to leverage both patterns, we propose Question-Free
Fine-Tuning (QFFT), a fine-tuning approach that removes the input question
during training and learns exclusively from Long CoT responses. This approach
enables the model to adaptively employ both reasoning patterns: it prioritizes
the Short CoT patterns and activates the Long CoT patterns only when necessary.
Experiments on various mathematical datasets demonstrate that QFFT reduces
average response length by more than 50\%, while achieving performance
comparable to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, QFFT exhibits
superior performance compared to SFT in noisy, out-of-domain, and low-resource
scenarios.

Abstract: Legal passage retrieval is an important task that assists legal practitioners
in the time-intensive process of finding relevant precedents to support legal
arguments. This study investigates the task of retrieving legal passages or
paragraphs from decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU),
whose language is highly structured and formulaic, leading to repetitive
patterns. Understanding when lexical or semantic models are more effective at
handling the repetitive nature of legal language is key to developing retrieval
systems that are more accurate, efficient, and transparent for specific legal
domains. To this end, we explore when this routinized legal language is better
suited for retrieval using methods that rely on lexical and statistical
features, such as BM25, or dense retrieval models trained to capture semantic
and contextual information. A qualitative and quantitative analysis with three
complementary metrics shows that both lexical and dense models perform well in
scenarios with more repetitive usage of language, whereas BM25 performs better
than the dense models in more nuanced scenarios where repetition and
verbatim~quotes are less prevalent and in longer queries. Our experiments also
show that BM25 is a strong baseline, surpassing off-the-shelf dense models in 4
out of 7 performance metrics. However, fine-tuning a dense model on
domain-specific data led to improved performance, surpassing BM25 in most
metrics, and we analyze the effect of the amount of data used in fine-tuning on

Abstract: Online medical literature has made health information more available than
ever, however, the barrier of complex medical jargon prevents the general
public from understanding it. Though parallel and comparable corpora for
Biomedical Text Simplification have been introduced, these conflate the many
syntactic and lexical operations involved in simplification. To enable more
targeted development and evaluation, we present a fine-grained lexical
simplification task and dataset, Jargon Explanations for Biomedical
Simplification (JEBS, https://github.com/bill-from-ri/JEBS-data ). The JEBS
task involves identifying complex terms, classifying how to replace them, and
generating replacement text. The JEBS dataset contains 21,595 replacements for
10,314 terms across 400 biomedical abstracts and their manually simplified
versions. Additionally, we provide baseline results for a variety of rule-based
and transformer-based systems for the three sub-tasks. The JEBS task, data, and
baseline results pave the way for development and rigorous evaluation of
systems for replacing or explaining complex biomedical terms.

Abstract: Advancement in Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning capabilities enables
them to solve scientific problems with enhanced efficacy. Thereby, a
high-quality benchmark for comprehensive and appropriate assessment holds
significance, while existing ones either confront the risk of data
contamination or lack involved disciplines. To be specific, due to the data
source overlap of LLMs training and static benchmark, the keys or number
pattern of answers inadvertently memorized (i.e. data contamination), leading
to systematic overestimation of their reasoning capabilities, especially
numerical reasoning. We propose SciDA, a multidisciplinary benchmark that
consists exclusively of over 1k Olympic-level numerical computation problems,
allowing randomized numerical initializations for each inference round to avoid
reliance on fixed numerical patterns. We conduct a series of experiments with
both closed-source and open-source top-performing LLMs, and it is observed that
the performance of LLMs drop significantly under random numerical
initialization. Thus, we provide truthful and unbiased assessments of the
numerical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The data is available at

Abstract: With the rapid improvement in the general capabilities of LLMs, LLM
personalization, i.e., how to build LLM systems that can generate personalized
responses or services that are tailored to distinct user personas, has become
an increasingly important research and engineering problem. However, unlike
many new challenging benchmarks being released for evaluating the
general/reasoning capabilities, the lack of high-quality benchmarks for
evaluating LLM personalization greatly hinders progress in this field. To
address this, we introduce PersonaFeedback, a new benchmark that directly
evaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized responses given pre-defined
user personas and queries. Unlike existing benchmarks that require models to
infer implicit user personas from historical interactions, PersonaFeedback
decouples persona inference from personalization, focusing on evaluating the
model's ability to generate responses tailored to explicit personas.
PersonaFeedback consists of 8298 human-annotated test cases, which are
categorized into easy, medium, and hard tiers based on the contextual
complexity of the user personas and the difficulty in distinguishing subtle
differences between two personalized responses. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across a wide range of models. The empirical results reveal that
even state-of-the-art LLMs that can solve complex real-world reasoning tasks
could fall short on the hard tier of PersonaFeedback where even human
evaluators may find the distinctions challenging. Furthermore, we conduct an
in-depth analysis of failure modes across various types of systems,
demonstrating that the current retrieval-augmented framework should not be seen
as a de facto solution for personalization tasks. All benchmark data,
annotation protocols, and the evaluation pipeline will be publicly available to
facilitate future research on LLM personalization.

Abstract: While large language models have shown reasoning capabilities, their
application to the audio modality, particularly in large audio-language models
(ALMs), remains significantly underdeveloped. Addressing this gap requires a
systematic approach, involving a capable base model, high-quality
reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this
study, we present a comprehensive solution: we introduce the Audio Logical
Reasoning (ALR) dataset, consisting of 6,446 text-audio annotated samples
specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. Building on this resource,
we propose SoundMind, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
tailored to endow ALMs with deep bimodal reasoning abilities. By training
Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the ALR dataset using SoundMind, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in audio logical reasoning. This work highlights
the impact of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with
specialized RL techniques, advancing the frontier of auditory intelligence in

the key factor that determines the outcome of an operation. To understand how
the team practices teamwork during the operation, we collected CliniDial from
simulations of medical operations. CliniDial includes the audio data and its
transcriptions, the simulated physiology signals of the patient manikins, and
how the team operates from two camera angles. We annotate behavior codes
following an existing framework to understand the teamwork process for
CliniDial. We pinpoint three main characteristics of our dataset, including its
label imbalances, rich and natural interactions, and multiple modalities, and
conduct experiments to test existing LLMs' capabilities on handling data with
these characteristics. Experimental results show that CliniDial poses
significant challenges to the existing models, inviting future effort on

TL;DR: Bilingual and multilingual language models can have inconsistent performance across languages due to data quality issues. This paper suggests a data filtering method using high-quality English data to improve monolingual performance and reduce performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why bilingual and multilingual models perform inconsistently across different languages and to find a solution to balance their performance.

Method: The method involves comparing bilingual and monolingual models to analyze the causes of performance inconsistencies, particularly focusing on data quality. The authors propose a data filtering strategy that selects higher-quality bilingual data using only high-quality English data.

Result: Applying the data filtering approach to French, German, and Chinese improved monolingual performance by 2-4% and reduced bilingual model performance gaps to 1%.

Conclusion: The study concludes that data quality is a crucial factor in multilingual pretraining that has been overlooked. The proposed filtering method offers a practical way to balance model performance across languages.

Abstract: Bilingual and multilingual language models offer a promising path toward
scaling NLP systems across diverse languages and users. However, their
performance often varies wildly between languages as prior works show that
adding more languages can degrade performance for some languages (such as
English), while improving others (typically more data constrained languages).
In this work, we investigate causes of these inconsistencies by comparing
bilingual and monolingual language models. Our analysis reveals that unequal
data quality, not just data quantity, is a major driver of performance
degradation in bilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective data
filtering strategy to select higher-quality bilingual training data with only
high quality English data. Applied to French, German, and Chinese, our approach
improves monolingual performance by 2-4% and reduces bilingual model
performance gaps to 1%. These results highlight the overlooked importance of
data quality in multilingual pretraining and offer a practical recipe for
balancing performance.

Abstract: Media outlets are becoming more partisan and polarized nowadays. Most
previous work focused on detecting media bias. In this paper, we aim to
mitigate media bias by generating a neutralized summary given multiple articles
presenting different ideological views. Motivated by the critical role of
events and event relations in media bias detection, we propose to increase
awareness of bias in LLMs via multi-document events reasoning and use a
multi-document event relation graph to guide the summarization process. This
graph contains rich event information useful to reveal bias: four common types
of in-doc event relations to reflect content framing bias, cross-doc event
coreference relation to reveal content selection bias, and event-level moral
opinions to highlight opinionated framing bias. We further develop two
strategies to incorporate the multi-document event relation graph for
neutralized summarization. Firstly, we convert a graph into natural language
descriptions and feed the textualized graph into LLMs as a part of a hard text
prompt. Secondly, we encode the graph with graph attention network and insert
the graph embedding into LLMs as a soft prompt. Both automatic evaluation and
human evaluation confirm that our approach effectively mitigates both lexical
and informational media bias, and meanwhile improves content preservation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) generally requires a deep
understanding of the contextual information, including the words associated
with the aspect terms and their syntactic dependencies. Most existing studies
employ advanced encoders (e.g., pre-trained models) to capture such context,
especially large language models (LLMs). However, training these encoders is
resource-intensive, and in many cases, the available data is insufficient for
necessary fine-tuning. Therefore it is challenging for learning LLMs within
such restricted environments and computation efficiency requirement. As a
result, it motivates the exploration of plug-and-play methods that adapt LLMs
to ABSA with minimal effort. In this paper, we propose an approach that
integrates extendable components capable of incorporating various types of
syntactic knowledge, such as constituent syntax, word dependencies, and
combinatory categorial grammar (CCG). Specifically, we propose a memory module
that records syntactic information and is incorporated into LLMs to instruct
the prediction of sentiment polarities. Importantly, this encoder acts as a
versatile, detachable plugin that is trained independently of the LLM. We
conduct experiments on benchmark datasets, which show that our approach
outperforms strong baselines and previous approaches, thus demonstrates its
effectiveness.

TL;DR: This study explores how well GPT-4 can mimic human style in translating Chinese online literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research shows that machine translations of literary texts are often not good enough, and there's not much study on how well the latest big language models like GPT-4 do in this area.

Method: They looked at the style features of GPT-4's translations and compared them with human translations using computer methods.

Result: GPT-4's translations were similar to humans in words, sentence structure, and content.

Conclusion: AI like GPT-4 might be able to copy the style of human literary translations, making it hard to tell them apart.

Abstract: Existing research indicates that machine translations (MTs) of literary texts
are often unsatisfactory. MTs are typically evaluated using automated metrics
and subjective human ratings, with limited focus on stylistic features.
Evidence is also limited on whether state-of-the-art large language models
(LLMs) will reshape literary translation. This study examines the stylistic
features of LLM translations, comparing GPT-4's performance to human
translations in a Chinese online literature task. Computational stylometry
analysis shows that GPT-4 translations closely align with human translations in
lexical, syntactic, and content features, suggesting that LLMs might replicate
the 'human touch' in literary translation style. These findings offer insights
into AI's impact on literary translation from a posthuman perspective, where
distinctions between machine and human translations become increasingly blurry.

Abstract: In recent years, embedding alignment has become the state-of-the-art machine
translation approach, as it can yield high-quality translation without training
on parallel corpora. However, existing research and application of embedding
alignment mostly focus on high-resource languages with high-quality monolingual
embeddings. It is unclear if and how low-resource languages may be similarly
benefited. In this study, we implement an established supervised embedding
alignment method for word translation from English to Yoruba, the latter a
low-resource language. We found that higher embedding quality and normalizing
embeddings increase word translation precision, with, additionally, an
interaction effect between the two. Our results demonstrate the limitations of
the state-of-the-art supervised embedding alignment when it comes to
low-resource languages, for which there are additional factors that need to be
taken into consideration, such as the importance of curating high-quality
monolingual embeddings. We hope our work will be a starting point for further
machine translation research that takes into account the challenges that
low-resource languages face.

TL;DR: This paper studies how adding parallel data affects the multilingual abilities of large language models, showing it can significantly improve translation and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Some think parallel data isn't needed for multilingual LLMs due to their translation skills, but the paper aims to check if parallel data still helps despite recent methods trying to use it more effectively.

Method: They did controlled experiments to see the impact of adding parallel data on LLMs' multilingual capabilities, especially in translation and common-sense reasoning.

Result: The experiments showed that adding parallel data significantly improves LLMs' multilingual capabilities.

Conclusion: Parallel data is still useful for enhancing multilingual LLMs, even with existing methods that try to use it efficiently.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive translation
capabilities even without being explicitly trained on parallel data. This
remarkable property has led some to believe that parallel data is no longer
necessary for building multilingual language models. While some attribute this
to the emergent abilities of LLMs due to scale, recent work suggests that it is
actually caused by incidental bilingual signals present in the training data.
Various methods have been proposed to maximize the utility of parallel data to
enhance the multilingual capabilities of multilingual encoder-based and
encoder-decoder language models. However, some decoder-based LLMs opt to ignore
parallel data instead. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on the
impact of adding parallel data on LLMs' multilingual capabilities, focusing
specifically on translation and multilingual common-sense reasoning. Through
controlled experiments, we demonstrate that parallel data can significantly
improve LLMs' multilingual capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved with the growth
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and are now applied in various fields. In
finance, the integration of diverse modalities such as text, charts, and tables
is crucial for accurate and efficient decision-making. Therefore, an effective
evaluation system that incorporates these data types is essential for advancing
financial application. In this paper, we introduce CFBenchmark-MM, a Chinese
multimodal financial benchmark with over 9,000 image-question pairs featuring
tables, histogram charts, line charts, pie charts, and structural diagrams.
Additionally, we develop a staged evaluation system to assess MLLMs in handling
multimodal information by providing different visual content step by step.
Despite MLLMs having inherent financial knowledge, experimental results still
show limited efficiency and robustness in handling multimodal financial
context. Further analysis on incorrect responses reveals the misinterpretation
of visual content and the misunderstanding of financial concepts are the
primary issues. Our research validates the significant, yet underexploited,
potential of MLLMs in financial analysis, highlighting the need for further
development and domain-specific optimization to encourage the enhanced use in
financial domain.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on
complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy
by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long
chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires
generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce
the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these
methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally,
prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the
important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this
pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning
tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention,
which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention
for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations
for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group
together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids
both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key
vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update
process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens,
thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We
evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our
approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive
attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to
demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to
4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications. Our
code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/MultipoleAttention.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as the core of agent
frameworks in various scenarios, such as social simulations and AI companions.
However, the extent to which they can replicate human-like motivations remains
an underexplored question. Existing benchmarks are constrained by simplistic
scenarios and the absence of character identities, resulting in an information
asymmetry with real-world situations. To address this gap, we propose
MotiveBench, which consists of 200 rich contextual scenarios and 600 reasoning
tasks covering multiple levels of motivation. Using MotiveBench, we conduct
extensive experiments on seven popular model families, comparing different
scales and versions within each family. The results show that even the most
advanced LLMs still fall short in achieving human-like motivational reasoning.
Our analysis reveals key findings, including the difficulty LLMs face in
reasoning about "love & belonging" motivations and their tendency toward
excessive rationality and idealism. These insights highlight a promising
direction for future research on the humanization of LLMs. The dataset,

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate significant cross-modal reasoning

training paradigms for reasoning enhancement. To address these issues, we
propose an integrated framework, FinLMM-R1, combining an automated and scalable
pipeline for data construction with enhanced training strategies to improve the
multimodal reasoning of LMM. The Automated and Scalable Pipeline (ASP) resolves
textual-visual misalignment in financial reports through a separate paradigm of
question-answer generation and image-question alignment, ensuring data
integrity and extraction efficiency. Through ASP, we collect 89,378 aligned
image-question pairs from 23,397 financial reports, covering tasks such as
arithmetic reasoning, statistics reasoning, financial explanation, and
financial knowledge. Moreover, we introduce the Thinking with Adversarial
Reward in LMM (TAR-LMM), extending the prior two-stage training framework [1]
with additional reward mechanisms. In the first stage, we focus on text-only
tasks with format and accuracy rewards to guide the model in generating
well-structured thinking contents. In the second stage, we construct
multi-image contrastive samples with additional reward components including
image selection, thinking content length, and adversarial reward to jointly
optimize the LMM across visual perception, reasoning efficiency, and logical
coherence. Extensive experiments on 7 benchmarks show ASP-derived dataset and
training framework significantly improve answer accuracy and reasoning depth

Conclusion: The conclusion is that integrating RAG and self-refinement with LLMs, along with self-evaluation, leads to better entity-aware machine translation without sacrificing translation quality.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our approach for the SemEval 2025 Task 2 on

Conclusion: Test-time scaling can enhance medical model reasoning, but requires careful adaptation to ensure reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has recently emerged as a promising approach for enhancing

many critical aspects remain underexplored, including their effectiveness for

test-time scaling in the medical domain. We evaluate its impact on both large
language models and vision-language models, considering factors such as model
size, inherent model characteristics, and task complexity. Finally, we assess
the robustness of these strategies under user-driven factors, such as
misleading information embedded in prompts. Our findings offer practical
guidelines for the effective use of test-time scaling in medical applications
and provide insights into how these strategies can be further refined to meet

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with dynamically selected demonstrations combines
the flexibility of prompting large language models (LLMs) with the ability to
leverage training data to improve performance. While ICL has been highly
successful for prediction and generation tasks, leveraging it for agentic tasks
that require sequential decision making is challenging -- one must think not
only about how to annotate long trajectories at scale and how to select
demonstrations, but also what constitutes demonstrations, and when and where to
show them. To address this, we first propose an algorithm that leverages an LLM
with retries along with demonstrations to automatically and efficiently
annotate agentic tasks with solution trajectories. We then show that
set-selection of trajectories of similar tasks as demonstrations significantly
improves performance, reliability, robustness, and efficiency of LLM agents.
However, trajectory demonstrations have a large inference cost overhead. We
show that this can be mitigated by using small trajectory snippets at every
step instead of an additional trajectory. We find that demonstrations obtained
from larger models (in the annotation phase) also improve smaller models, and
that ICL agents can even rival costlier trained agents. Thus, our results
reveal that ICL, with careful use, can be very powerful for agentic tasks as
well.

TL;DR: This paper improves decoder-only LLMs for minimal-edit English GEC by proposing a new training schedule, achieving state-of-the-art results on BEA-test, and releasing source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoder-only LLMs are effective for fluency-edit GEC but underexplored for minimal-edit. Need to enhance their performance in minimal-edit scenarios.

Method: Propose a novel training schedule method for error rate adaptation. Detokenize common GEC datasets and correct errors in them.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art results for single-model systems on BEA-test. Found that training on detokenized, corrected datasets improves performance.

Conclusion: The proposed training schedule and dataset refinement enhance decoder-only LLMs for minimal-edit GEC, with code released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models have shown superior performance in the
fluency-edit English Grammatical Error Correction, but their adaptation for
minimal-edit English GEC is still underexplored. To improve their effectiveness
in the minimal-edit approach, we explore the error rate adaptation topic and
propose a novel training schedule method. Our experiments set a new
state-of-the-art result for a single-model system on the BEA-test set. We also
detokenize the most common English GEC datasets to match the natural way of
writing text. During the process, we find that there are errors in them. Our
experiments analyze whether training on detokenized datasets impacts the
results and measure the impact of the usage of the datasets with corrected
erroneous examples. To facilitate reproducibility, we have released the source
code used to train our models.

Abstract: We present and evaluate a suite of proof-of-concept (PoC), structured
workflow prompts designed to elicit human-like hierarchical reasoning while
guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic and linguistic
analysis of scholarly manuscripts. The prompts target two non-trivial
analytical tasks: identifying unsubstantiated claims in summaries
(informational integrity) and flagging ambiguous pronoun references (linguistic
clarity). We conducted a systematic, multi-run evaluation on two frontier
models (Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) under varied context
conditions. Our results for the informational integrity task reveal a
significant divergence in model performance: while both models successfully
identified an unsubstantiated head of a noun phrase (95% success), ChatGPT
consistently failed (0% success) to identify an unsubstantiated adjectival
modifier that Gemini correctly flagged (95% success), raising a question
regarding potential influence of the target's syntactic role. For the
linguistic analysis task, both models performed well (80-90% success) with full
manuscript context. In a summary-only setting, however, ChatGPT achieved a
perfect (100%) success rate, while Gemini's performance was substantially
degraded. Our findings suggest that structured prompting is a viable
methodology for complex textual analysis but show that prompt performance may
be highly dependent on the interplay between the model, task type, and context,
highlighting the need for rigorous, model-specific testing.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of rules as an alternative to ML and LLMs for information extraction, emphasizing sustainability, transferability, interpretability, and reduced development burden. It proposes a combined approach using a REST decision tool to help annotators choose between rules and ML for each entity, showing good external validity in a 12-entity case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find a sustainable, transferable, and interpretable IE method compared to ML and LLMs, reducing development burden and minimizing manual annotation for training.

Method: The method involves using the REST decision tool, which helps annotators visualize entity characteristics and assess rule development feasibility and performance metrics. It starts with expert manual highlighting in a single session for a representative data subset.

Result: The REST tool was validated for feasibility and performance metrics, showing good reproducibility in an external validity test on a 12-entity use case.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that combining rules and ML using REST is a viable IE method, offering sustainability and interpretability while reducing reliance on extensive manual annotation.

Abstract: Rules could be an information extraction (IE) default option, compared to ML
and LLMs in terms of sustainability, transferability, interpretability, and
development burden. We suggest a sustainable and combined use of rules and ML
as an IE method. Our approach starts with an exhaustive expert manual
highlighting in a single working session of a representative subset of the data
corpus. We developed and validated the feasibility and the performance metrics
of the REST decision tool to help the annotator choose between rules as a by
default option and ML for each entity of an IE task. REST makes the annotator
visualize the characteristics of each entity formalization in the free texts
and the expected rule development feasibility and IE performance metrics. ML is
considered as a backup IE option and manual annotation for training is
therefore minimized. The external validity of REST on a 12-entity use case
showed good reproducibility.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
text generation and understanding, yet their reliance on implicit, unstructured
knowledge often leads to factual inaccuracies and limited interpretability.
Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured, relational representations,
offer a promising solution to ground LLMs in verified knowledge. However, their
potential remains constrained by inherent noise, incompleteness, and the
complexity of integrating their rigid structure with the flexible reasoning of
LLMs. This thesis presents a systematic framework to address these limitations,
advancing the reliability of KGs and their synergistic integration with LLMs
through five interconnected contributions. This thesis addresses these
challenges through a cohesive framework that enhances LLMs by refining and
leveraging reliable KGs. First, we introduce contrastive error detection, a
structure-based method to identify incorrect facts in KGs. This approach is
extended by an attribute-aware framework that unifies structural and semantic
signals for error correction. Next, we propose an inductive completion model
that further refines KGs by completing the missing relationships in evolving
KGs. Building on these refined KGs, KnowGPT integrates structured graph
reasoning into LLMs through dynamic prompting, improving factual grounding.
These contributions form a systematic pipeline (from error detection to LLM
integration), demonstrating that reliable KGs significantly enhance the
robustness, interpretability, and adaptability of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DMAO, a framework that optimizes neural network architecture by reallocating parameters during training with minimal overhead, achieving up to 6% relative WER improvement across different datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing architecture design methods are either manual (requiring expert knowledge) or computationally heavy (like neural architecture search). DMAO aims to provide an efficient alternative that automatically reallocates parameters without significant computational cost.

Method: DMAO uses a grow-and-drop strategy to dynamically reallocate parameters during training, shifting resources to more beneficial parts of the model while maintaining the overall complexity.

Result: Experiments on LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM-v2, and Switchboard datasets show that DMAO improves WER by up to 6% relative with the same training resources, without introducing significant training overhead.

Conclusion: DMAO offers an effective and efficient way to optimize neural network architectures by redistributing parameters during training, leading to consistent performance improvements across different models and datasets.

Abstract: Architecture design is inherently complex. Existing approaches rely on either
handcrafted rules, which demand extensive empirical expertise, or automated
methods like neural architecture search, which are computationally intensive.
In this paper, we introduce DMAO, an architecture optimization framework that
employs a grow-and-drop strategy to automatically reallocate parameters during
training. This reallocation shifts resources from less-utilized areas to those
parts of the model where they are most beneficial. Notably, DMAO only
introduces negligible training overhead at a given model complexity. We
evaluate DMAO through experiments with CTC on LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM-v2 and
Switchboard datasets. The results show that, using the same amount of training
resources, our proposed DMAO consistently improves WER by up to 6% relatively
across various architectures, model sizes, and datasets. Furthermore, we
analyze the pattern of parameter redistribution and uncover insightful
findings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets, they have
raised significant privacy and ethical concerns due to their potential to
inadvertently retain sensitive information. Unlearning seeks to selectively
remove specific data from trained models, such as personal information or
copyrighted content. Current approaches targeting specific output sequences at
the token level often fail to achieve complete forgetting and remain
susceptible to prompt rephrasing. We propose Align-then-Unlearn, a novel
framework that performs unlearning in the semantic embedding space rather than
directly on output tokens. Align-then-Unlearn first augments the LLM with an
embedding prediction module trained to anticipate future context
representations. Unlearning is then achieved by fine-tuning the model to
minimize the similarity between these predicted embeddings and a target
embedding that represents the concept to be removed. Initial results show that
Align-then-Unlearn effectively removes targeted knowledge with minimal
degradation in overall model utility. These findings suggest that
embedding-based unlearning offers a promising and robust approach to removing
conceptual knowledge. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often constrained by rigid reasoning
processes, limiting their ability to generate creative and diverse responses.
To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and
multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of
traditional LLMs. First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step
logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of
thought. Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert
modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks. Finally, dimensionality reduction
maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding
more precise and creative responses. Extensive experiments across multiple
tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion,
creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that
outperform traditional models. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of
CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. This work
contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of
addressing complex and novel tasks.

TL;DR: This study shows that national music preferences reflect cultural values, with clusters of music data aligning with cultural zones from the World Values Survey.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how national music preferences relate to cultural values and if they can serve as a proxy for cultural boundaries.

Method: Collected YouTube Music data from 62 countries, used CLAP for audio embeddings, LP-MusicCaps and GPT for semantic captions, clustered countries with contrastive embeddings, and projected clusters with t-SNE.

Result: Music-based clusters significantly align with cultural zones from the WVS, and residual analysis shows non-random associations between clusters and cultural zones.

Conclusion: National music preferences encode cultural signals and can be used to understand global cultural boundaries.

Abstract: This study explores the extent to which national music preferences reflect
underlying cultural values. We collected long-term popular music data from
YouTube Music Charts across 62 countries, encompassing both Western and
non-Western regions, and extracted audio embeddings using the CLAP model. To
complement these quantitative representations, we generated semantic captions
for each track using LP-MusicCaps and GPT-based summarization. Countries were
clustered based on contrastive embeddings that highlight deviations from global
musical norms. The resulting clusters were projected into a two-dimensional
space via t-SNE for visualization and evaluated against cultural zones defined
by the World Values Survey (WVS). Statistical analyses, including MANOVA and
chi-squared tests, confirmed that music-based clusters exhibit significant
alignment with established cultural groupings. Furthermore, residual analysis
revealed consistent patterns of overrepresentation, suggesting non-random
associations between specific clusters and cultural zones. These findings
indicate that national-level music preferences encode meaningful cultural
signals and can serve as a proxy for understanding global cultural boundaries.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Capability Salience Vector to align validation loss with downstream task performance by decomposing loss and assigning importance weights to tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between validation loss and downstream capabilities, as current scaling laws don't directly predict downstream task performance.

Method: The method involves introducing Capability Salience Vector, which decomposes overall loss and assigns different importance weights to tokens for assessing meta-capabilities.

Result: Experiments show that Capability Salience Vector significantly improves predictability of language model performance on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that Capability Salience Vector effectively aligns validation loss with downstream task capabilities, enhancing performance prediction.

Abstract: Scaling law builds the relationship between training computation and
validation loss, enabling researchers to effectively predict the loss trending
of models across different levels of computation. However, a gap still remains
between validation loss and the model's downstream capabilities, making it
untrivial to apply scaling law to direct performance prediction for downstream
tasks. The loss typically represents a cumulative penalty for predicted tokens,
which are implicitly considered to have equal importance. Nevertheless, our
studies have shown evidence that when considering different training data
distributions, we cannot directly model the relationship between downstream
capability and computation or token loss. To bridge the gap between validation
loss and downstream task capabilities, in this work, we introduce Capability
Salience Vector, which decomposes the overall loss and assigns different
importance weights to tokens to assess a specific meta-capability, aligning the
validation loss with downstream task performance in terms of the model's
capabilities. Experiments on various popular benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed Capability Salience Vector could significantly improve the
predictability of language model performance on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for recommendation
by framing item prediction as a token-by-token language generation task.
However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing
likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks
crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little
to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify
token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation
as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain
(IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our
empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to
high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which
may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an
Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that
integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD
downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize
tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood
maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that
IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains
on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin
by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing
the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per
prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance,
with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then
explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i)
Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after
large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling
temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and
exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i)
holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the
sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted
entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration
and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models
narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT
foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our
AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms
AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among
Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks,
thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe. We release

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language tasks, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Recent model
editing-based approaches enable efficient backdoor injection by directly
modifying parameters to map specific triggers to attacker-desired responses.
However, these methods often suffer from safety fallback, where the model
initially responds affirmatively but later reverts to refusals due to safety
alignment. In this work, we propose DualEdit, a dual-objective model editing
framework that jointly promotes affirmative outputs and suppresses refusal
responses. To address two key challenges -- balancing the trade-off between
affirmative promotion and refusal suppression, and handling the diversity of
refusal expressions -- DualEdit introduces two complementary techniques. (1)
Dynamic loss weighting calibrates the objective scale based on the pre-edited
model to stabilize optimization. (2) Refusal value anchoring compresses the
suppression target space by clustering representative refusal value vectors,
reducing optimization conflict from overly diverse token sets. Experiments on
safety-aligned LLMs show that DualEdit improves attack success by 9.98\% and
reduces safety fallback rate by 10.88\% over baselines.

Abstract: Reading and evaluating product reviews is central to how most people decide
what to buy and consume online. However, the recent emergence of Large Language
Models and Generative Artificial Intelligence now means writing fraudulent or
fake reviews is potentially easier than ever. Through three studies we
demonstrate that (1) humans are no longer able to distinguish between real and
fake product reviews generated by machines, averaging only 50.8% accuracy
overall - essentially the same that would be expected by chance alone; (2) that
LLMs are likewise unable to distinguish between fake and real reviews and
perform equivalently bad or even worse than humans; and (3) that humans and
LLMs pursue different strategies for evaluating authenticity which lead to
equivalently bad accuracy, but different precision, recall and F1 scores -
indicating they perform worse at different aspects of judgment. The results
reveal that review systems everywhere are now susceptible to mechanised fraud
if they do not depend on trustworthy purchase verification to guarantee the
authenticity of reviewers. Furthermore, the results provide insight into the
consumer psychology of how humans judge authenticity, demonstrating there is an
inherent 'scepticism bias' towards positive reviews and a special vulnerability
to misjudge the authenticity of fake negative reviews. Additionally, results
provide a first insight into the 'machine psychology' of judging fake reviews,
revealing that the strategies LLMs take to evaluate authenticity radically
differ from humans, in ways that are equally wrong in terms of accuracy, but
different in their misjudgments.

Abstract: Numerical consistency across tables in disclosure documents is critical for
ensuring accuracy, maintaining credibility, and avoiding reputational and
economic risks. Automated tabular numerical cross-checking presents two
significant challenges: (C1) managing the combinatorial explosion of candidate
instances at the document level and (C2) comprehending multi-faceted numerical
semantics. Previous research typically depends on heuristic-based filtering or
simplified context extraction, often struggling to balance performance and
efficiency. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
contextual understanding capabilities that helps address C2 at the instance
level, yet they remain hampered by computational inefficiency (C1) and limited
domain expertise. This paper introduces CoFiTCheck, a novel LLM-based
coarse-to-fine framework that addresses these challenges through two sequential
stages: embedding-based filtering and discriminative classification. The
embedding-based filtering stage introduces an instructional parallel encoding
method to efficiently represent all numerical mentions in a table with LLMs, as
well as a decoupled InfoNCE objective to mitigate the isolated mention problem.
The discriminative classification stage employs a specialized LLM for
fine-grained analysis of the remaining candidate pairs. This stage is further
enhanced by our crosstable numerical alignment pretraining paradigm, which
leverages weak supervision from cross-table numerical equality relationships to
enrich task-specific priors without requiring manual annotation. Comprehensive
evaluation across three types of real-world disclosure documents demonstrates
that CoFiTCheck significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining
practical efficiency.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a cornerstone of large-scale
deep learning by efficiently distributing computation and enhancing
performance. However, their unique architecture-characterized by sparse expert
activation and dynamic routing mechanisms-introduces inherent complexities that
challenge conventional quantization techniques. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods struggle to address activation outliers, router
consistency and sparse expert calibration, leading to significant performance
degradation. To bridge this gap, we propose EAQuant, a novel PTQ framework
tailored for MoE architectures. Our method systematically tackles these
challenges through three key innovations: (1) expert-aware smoothing
aggregation to suppress activation outliers and stabilize quantization, (2)
router logits distribution alignment to preserve expert selection consistency
post-quantization, and (3) expert-level calibration data balance to optimize
sparsely activated experts. Extensive experiments across W4A4 and extreme W3A4
quantization configurations demonstrate that EAQuant significantly outperforms
existing methods, achieving average score improvements of 1.15 - 2.28% across
three diverse MoE architectures, with particularly pronounced gains in
reasoning tasks and robust performance retention under aggressive quantization.
By integrating these innovations, EAQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art
for high-precision, efficient MoE model compression. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive
reasoning abilities in structured tasks like mathematics and programming,
largely driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which
uses outcome-based signals that are scalable, effective, and robust against
reward hacking. However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form
reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable
reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization
(DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended,
particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the
Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and
emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of
the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the
consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level.
Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized,
enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a
dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks,
reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two
diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a
math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong
baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Long-term memory (LTM) is essential for large language models (LLMs) to
achieve autonomous intelligence in complex, evolving environments. Despite
increasing efforts in memory-augmented and retrieval-based architectures, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to systematically evaluate LLMs'
long-term memory abilities. Existing benchmarks still face challenges in
evaluating knowledge retention and dynamic sequential reasoning, and in their
own flexibility, all of which limit their effectiveness in assessing models'
LTM capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose a novel benchmark framework
based on interactive fiction games, featuring dynamically branching storylines
with complex reasoning structures. These structures simulate real-world
scenarios by requiring LLMs to navigate hierarchical decision trees, where each
choice triggers cascading dependencies across multi-turn interactions. Our
benchmark emphasizes two distinct settings to test reasoning complexity: one
with immediate feedback upon incorrect decisions, and the other requiring
models to independently trace back and revise earlier choices after failure. As
part of this benchmark, we also construct a new dataset designed to test LLMs'
LTM within narrative-driven environments. We further validate the effectiveness
of our approach through detailed experiments. Experimental results demonstrate
the benchmark's ability to robustly and reliably assess LTM in LLMs.

Abstract: Visual Information Extraction (VIE) converts unstructured document images
into structured formats like JSON, critical for medical applications such as
report analysis and online consultations. Traditional methods rely on OCR and
language models, while end-to-end multimodal models offer direct JSON
generation. However, domain-specific schemas and high annotation costs limit
their effectiveness in medical VIE. We base our approach on the Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework to address these challenges
using only 100 annotated samples. Our approach ensures dataset diversity, a
balanced precision-recall reward mechanism to reduce hallucinations and improve
field coverage, and innovative sampling strategies to enhance reasoning
capabilities. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our RLVR method, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on medical VIE tasks, significantly improving F1,
precision, and recall. While our models excel on tasks similar to medical
datasets, performance drops on dissimilar tasks, highlighting the need for
domain-specific optimization. Case studies further demonstrate the value of
reasoning during training and inference for VIE.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks, but struggle with
multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on
knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking
Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally
lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel retrieval approach that integrates
textual knowledge graphs into the LLM reasoning process via query
decomposition. Our method decomposes complex questions into sub-questions,
retrieves relevant textual subgraphs, and composes a question-specific
knowledge graph to guide answer generation. For that, we use a weighted
similarity function that focuses on both the complex question and the generated
subquestions to extract a relevant subgraph, which allows efficient and precise
retrieval for complex questions and improves the performance of LLMs on
multi-hop QA tasks. This structured reasoning pipeline enhances factual
grounding and interpretability while leveraging the generative strengths of
LLMs. We evaluate our method on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that
it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods,
using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance multilingual continuous conversational ASR by leveraging context-aware information, addressing the limitations of isolated segment decoding and flawed transcriptions during inference.

Method: The method involves a character-level contextual masking strategy during training to improve robustness and a two-stage decoding pipeline: initial isolated segment decoding followed by context-aware re-decoding using neighboring hypotheses.

Result: The proposed method achieves an 18% relative improvement over a strong baseline on the 1500-hour MLC-SLM corpus, outperforming a model trained on 6000 hours of data for the MLC-SLM competition.

Conclusion: The results highlight the significant advantage of incorporating contextual information in multilingual continuous conversational ASR, suggesting that context-aware approaches can lead to more accurate and robust speech recognition systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the integration of language-specific bi-directional
context into a speech large language model (SLLM) to improve multilingual
continuous conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR). We propose a
character-level contextual masking strategy during training, which randomly
removes portions of the context to enhance robustness and better emulate the
flawed transcriptions that may occur during inference. For decoding, a
two-stage pipeline is utilized: initial isolated segment decoding followed by
context-aware re-decoding using neighboring hypotheses. Evaluated on the
1500-hour Multilingual Conversational Speech and Language Model (MLC-SLM)
corpus covering eleven languages, our method achieves an 18% relative
improvement compared to a strong baseline, outperforming even the model trained
on 6000 hours of data for the MLC-SLM competition. These results underscore the
significant benefit of incorporating contextual information in multilingual
continuous conversational ASR.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an
increasing need for challenging benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities in
handling complex tabular data. However, existing benchmarks are either based on
outdated data setups or focus solely on simple, flat table structures. In this
paper, we introduce RealHiTBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the performance of both LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) across a
variety of input formats for complex tabular data, including LaTeX, HTML, and
PNG. RealHiTBench also includes a diverse collection of tables with intricate
structures, spanning a wide range of task types. Our experimental results,
using 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrate that RealHiTBench is indeed a
challenging benchmark. Moreover, we also develop TreeThinker, a tree-based
pipeline that organizes hierarchical headers into a tree structure for enhanced
tabular reasoning, validating the importance of improving LLMs' perception of
table hierarchies. We hope that our work will inspire further research on
tabular data reasoning and the development of more robust models. The code and

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It takes several years for the developing brain of a baby to fully master
word repetition-the task of hearing a word and repeating it aloud. Repeating a
new word, such as from a new language, can be a challenging task also for
adults. Additionally, brain damage, such as from a stroke, may lead to
systematic speech errors with specific characteristics dependent on the
location of the brain damage. Cognitive sciences suggest a model with various
components for the different processing stages involved in word repetition.
While some studies have begun to localize the corresponding regions in the
brain, the neural mechanisms and how exactly the brain performs word repetition
remain largely unknown. We propose to bridge the gap between the cognitive
model of word repetition and neural mechanisms in the human brain by modeling
the task using deep neural networks. Neural models are fully observable,
allowing us to study the detailed mechanisms in their various substructures and
make comparisons with human behavior and, ultimately, the brain. Here, we make
first steps in this direction by: (1) training a large set of models to
simulate the word repetition task; (2) creating a battery of tests to probe the
models for known effects from behavioral studies in humans, and (3) simulating
brain damage through ablation studies, where we systematically remove neurons
from the model, and repeat the behavioral study to examine the resulting speech
errors in the "patient" model. Our results show that neural models can mimic
several effects known from human research, but might diverge in other aspects,
highlighting both the potential and the challenges for future research aimed at
developing human-like neural models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks
such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which
is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge,
remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a
framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we
decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary
dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit
guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and
generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through
accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical
study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful
findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual
understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are
effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. Based on our framework
and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and
realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning
cognition dimensions. It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation
and development of more adaptive and human-like models.

Abstract: The growing volume of omics and clinical data generated for neurodegenerative
diseases (NDs) requires new approaches for their curation so they can be
ready-to-use in bioinformatics. NeuroEmbed is an approach for the engineering
of semantically accurate embedding spaces to represent cohorts and samples. The
NeuroEmbed method comprises four stages: (1) extraction of ND cohorts from
public repositories; (2) semi-automated normalization and augmentation of
metadata of cohorts and samples using biomedical ontologies and clustering on
the embedding space; (3) automated generation of a natural language
question-answering (QA) dataset for cohorts and samples based on randomized
combinations of standardized metadata dimensions and (4) fine-tuning of a
domain-specific embedder to optimize queries. We illustrate the approach using
the GEO repository and the PubMedBERT pretrained embedder. Applying NeuroEmbed,
we semantically indexed 2,801 repositories and 150,924 samples. Amongst many
biology-relevant categories, we normalized more than 1,700 heterogeneous tissue
labels from GEO into 326 unique ontology-aligned concepts and enriched
annotations with new ontology-aligned terms, leading to a fold increase in size
for the metadata terms between 2.7 and 20 fold. After fine-tuning PubMedBERT
with the QA training data augmented with the enlarged metadata, the model
increased its mean Retrieval Precision from 0.277 to 0.866 and its mean
Percentile Rank from 0.355 to 0.896. The NeuroEmbed methodology for the
creation of electronic catalogues of omics cohorts and samples will foster
automated bioinformatic pipelines construction. The NeuroEmbed catalogue of
cohorts and samples is available at https://github.com/JoseAdrian3/NeuroEmbed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional supervised models in zero-shot stance detection, which struggle with unseen targets due to reliance on labeled data and shallow lexical cues.

Method: CIRF abstracts transferable reasoning schemas from unlabeled text and encodes them as concept-level logic, while SEGKM integrates these schemas with input arguments through dynamic alignment of reasoning structures.

Result: CIRF achieves state-of-the-art results on SemEval-2016, VAST, and COVID-19-Stance benchmarks, outperforming baselines by 1.0, 4.5, and 3.3 macro-F1 points, and matches accuracy with 70% less labeled data.

Conclusion: CIRF provides an effective approach for zero-shot stance detection by leveraging cognitive inductive reasoning and concept-level logic, demonstrating superior performance and data efficiency.

Abstract: Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to identify the stance of text toward
previously unseen targets, a setting where conventional supervised models often
fail due to reliance on labeled data and shallow lexical cues. Inspired by
human cognitive reasoning, we propose the Cognitive Inductive Reasoning
Framework (CIRF), which abstracts transferable reasoning schemas from unlabeled
text and encodes them as concept-level logic. To integrate these schemas with
input arguments, we introduce a Schema-Enhanced Graph Kernel Model (SEGKM) that
dynamically aligns local and global reasoning structures. Experiments on
SemEval-2016, VAST, and COVID-19-Stance benchmarks show that CIRF establishes
new state-of-the-art results, outperforming strong ZSSD baselines by 1.0, 4.5,
and 3.3 percentage points in macro-F1, respectively, and achieving comparable
accuracy with 70\% fewer labeled examples. We will release the full code upon
publication.

Abstract: Quantization has been widely studied as an effective technique for reducing
the memory requirement of large language models (LLMs), potentially improving
the latency time as well. Utilizing the characteristic of rotational invariance
of transformer, we propose the rotation-based saliency-aware weight
quantization (ROSAQ), which identifies salient channels in the projection
feature space, not in the original feature space, where the projected
"principal" dimensions are naturally considered as "salient" features. The
proposed ROSAQ consists of 1) PCA-based projection, which first performs
principal component analysis (PCA) on a calibration set and transforms via the
PCA projection, 2) Salient channel dentification, which selects dimensions
corresponding to the K-largest eigenvalues as salient channels, and 3)
Saliency-aware quantization with mixed-precision, which uses FP16 for salient
dimensions and INT3/4 for other dimensions. Experiment results show that ROSAQ
shows improvements over the baseline saliency-aware quantization on the
original feature space and other existing quantization methods. With kernel
fusion, ROSAQ presents about 2.3x speed up over FP16 implementation in
generating 256 tokens with a batch size of 64.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where
doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and
consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large
Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this
process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer
from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of
immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the
interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to
the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without
performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model
clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven
uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis
via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid
training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train
LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical
decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty
estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on
MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing
various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical
decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Merging or routing low-rank adapters (LoRAs) has emerged as a popular
solution for enhancing large language models, particularly when data access is
restricted by regulatory or domain-specific constraints. This position paper
argues that the research community should shift its focus from developing new
merging or routing algorithms to understanding the conditions under which
reusing LoRAs is truly effective. Through theoretical analysis and synthetic
two-hop reasoning and math word-problem tasks, we examine whether reusing LoRAs
enables genuine compositional generalization or merely reflects shallow pattern
matching. Evaluating two data-agnostic methods--parameter averaging and dynamic
adapter selection--we found that reusing LoRAs often fails to logically
integrate knowledge across disjoint fine-tuning datasets, especially when such
knowledge is underrepresented during pretraining. Our empirical results,
supported by theoretical insights into LoRA's limited expressiveness, highlight
the preconditions and constraints of reusing them for unseen tasks and cast
doubt on its feasibility as a truly data-free approach. We advocate for pausing
the pursuit of novel methods for recycling LoRAs and emphasize the need for
rigorous mechanisms to guide future academic research in adapter-based model
merging and practical system designs for practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of linguistic evaluation resources for Turkish, especially regarding under-studied aspects like word order flexibility and subordination through morphology.

Method: The method involves creating a benchmark with 16 linguistic phenomena and 1000 minimal pairs each, emphasizing Turkish-specific features. Experiments were conducted on various LMs and human judgments were collected.

Result: The results show that advanced LMs have difficulties with grammatical issues that are easy for humans and differ in sensitivity to word order and morphology compared to humans.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that TurBLiMP highlights the limitations of current LMs in handling Turkish-specific linguistic features, emphasizing the need for better models.

Abstract: We introduce TurBLiMP, the first Turkish benchmark of linguistic minimal
pairs, designed to evaluate the linguistic abilities of monolingual and
multilingual language models (LMs). Covering 16 linguistic phenomena with 1000
minimal pairs each, TurBLiMP fills an important gap in linguistic evaluation
resources for Turkish. In designing the benchmark, we give extra attention to
two properties of Turkish that remain understudied in current syntactic
evaluations of LMs, namely word order flexibility and subordination through
morphological processes. Our experiments on a wide range of LMs and a newly
collected set of human acceptability judgments reveal that even cutting-edge
Large LMs still struggle with grammatical phenomena that are not challenging
for humans, and may also exhibit different sensitivities to word order and
morphological complexity compared to humans.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional next-word prediction (NWP) in large language models, which lacks robust reasoning support despite providing fluency.

Method: BOW uses a reasoning bottleneck where a policy model generates a reasoning path before predicting the next token, with a frozen judge model using this path to predict the next token distribution. It's trained with GRPO using rewards based on reasoning path effectiveness.

Result: BOW improves both general and next-word reasoning capabilities of base models compared to other continual pretraining baselines, showing effectiveness and scalability as an alternative to vanilla NWP.

Conclusion: BOW can serve as an effective and scalable alternative to traditional NWP for enhancing reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained via next-word prediction
(NWP), which provides strong surface-level fluency but often lacks support for
robust reasoning. We propose BOttlenecked next Word exploration (BOW), a novel
RL framework that rethinks NWP by introducing a reasoning bottleneck where a
policy model first generates a reasoning path rather than predicting the next
token directly, after which a frozen judge model predicts the next token
distribution based solely on this reasoning path. We train the policy model
using GRPO with rewards that quantify how effectively the reasoning path
facilitates next-word recovery. Compared with other continual pretraining
baselines, we show that BOW improves both the general and next-word reasoning
capabilities of the base model, evaluated on various benchmarks. Our findings
show that BOW can serve as an effective and scalable alternative to vanilla
NWP.

Abstract: Language detoxification involves removing toxicity from offensive language.
While a neutral-toxic paired dataset provides a straightforward approach for

challenges: i) the need for human annotation to build paired data, and ii) the
rapid evolution of offensive terms, rendering static datasets quickly outdated.
To tackle these challenges, we introduce an automated paired data generation
pipeline, called K/DA. This pipeline is designed to generate offensive language
with implicit offensiveness and trend-aligned slang, making the resulting
dataset suitable for detoxification model training. We demonstrate that the
dataset generated by K/DA exhibits high pair consistency and greater implicit
offensiveness compared to existing Korean datasets, and also demonstrates
applicability to other languages. Furthermore, it enables effective training of
a high-performing detoxification model with simple instruction fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs, or on-device LMs) have significantly fewer
parameters than Large Language Models (LLMs). They are typically deployed on
low-end devices, like mobile phones and single-board computers. Unlike LLMs,
which rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed
for edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment
environments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints,
which are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these
two requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression
approach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token
embedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State
(MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across
compression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption
on a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion
parameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our
approach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model
with around $2.0\times$ embedding layer compression, while the energy
consumption of a single query drops by half.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transformer models face scalability challenges in causal language modeling
(CLM) due to inefficient memory allocation for growing key-value (KV) caches,
which strains compute and storage resources. Existing methods like Grouped
Query Attention (GQA) and token-level KV optimization improve efficiency but
rely on rigid resource allocation, often discarding "low-priority" tokens or
statically grouping them, failing to address the dynamic spectrum of token
importance. We propose mixSGA, a novel mixture-of-expert (MoE) approach that
dynamically optimizes token-wise computation and memory allocation. Unlike
prior approaches, mixSGA retains all tokens while adaptively routing them to
specialized experts with varying KV group sizes, balancing granularity and
efficiency. Our key novelties include: (1) a token-wise expert-choice routing
mechanism guided by learned importance scores, enabling proportional resource
allocation without token discard; (2) weight-sharing across grouped attention
projections to minimize parameter overhead; and (3) an auxiliary loss to ensure
one-hot routing decisions for training-inference consistency in CLMs. Extensive
evaluations across Llama3, TinyLlama, OPT, and Gemma2 model families show
mixSGA's superiority over static baselines. On instruction-following and
continued pretraining tasks, mixSGA achieves higher ROUGE-L and lower
perplexity under the same KV budgets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new dataset with explicit reasoning for pragmatic understanding, showing that thought-based learning improves LLMs' accuracy by 11.12% and 16.10% in related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of improving LLMs' pragmatic understanding by considering human reasoning processes beyond annotated labels.

Method: Created a dataset with explicit reasoning for correct and incorrect interpretations, then used preference-tuning and supervised fine-tuning to enhance LLMs' performance.

Result: Improved accuracy by 11.12% across model families through thought-based learning, and 16.10% improvement in tasks like presupposition and deixis without prior training.

Conclusion: Thought-based learning effectively enhances pragmatic understanding in LLMs, suggesting potential for broader applications in other pragmatic tasks.

Abstract: Pragmatics, the ability to infer meaning beyond literal interpretation, is
crucial for social cognition and communication. While LLMs have been
benchmarked for their pragmatic understanding, improving their performance
remains underexplored. Existing methods rely on annotated labels but overlook
the reasoning process humans naturally use to interpret implicit meaning. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel pragmatic dataset,
ImpliedMeaningPreference, that includes explicit reasoning (thoughts) for both
correct and incorrect interpretations. Through preference-tuning and supervised
fine-tuning, we demonstrate that thought-based learning significantly enhances
LLMs' pragmatic understanding, improving accuracy by 11.12% across model
families. We further discuss a transfer-learning study where we evaluate the
performance of thought-based training for the other tasks of pragmatics
(presupposition, deixis) that are not seen during the training time and observe
an improvement of 16.10% compared to label-trained models.

### [362] [Characterizing Linguistic Shifts in Croatian News via Diachronic Word Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13569)
*David Dukić,Ana Barić,Marko Čuljak,Josip Jukić,Martin Tutek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes semantic changes in Croatian news articles over 25 years using diachronic word embeddings, finding that major events influenced word meanings and that post-2020 embeddings show increased positivity despite reported mental health declines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how word semantics change over time can reveal cultural and perspective shifts. Previous studies required large temporally annotated corpora, which this work addresses by using a Croatian news corpus.

Method: The paper uses skip-gram word embeddings trained on five-year periods of a 9.5 million Croatian news article corpus to quantify semantic changes.

Result: The study found that word embeddings captured linguistic shifts for major topics like COVID-19, Croatia's EU entry, and tech advancements. Post-2020 embeddings showed increased positivity in sentiment analysis, conflicting with mental health decline studies.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that diachronic word embeddings can effectively track semantic changes related to significant historical events, suggesting that linguistic trends might reflect broader societal changes beyond just mental health.

Abstract: Measuring how semantics of words change over time improves our understanding
of how cultures and perspectives change. Diachronic word embeddings help us
quantify this shift, although previous studies leveraged substantial temporally
annotated corpora. In this work, we use a corpus of 9.5 million Croatian news
articles spanning the past 25 years and quantify semantic change using
skip-gram word embeddings trained on five-year periods. Our analysis finds that
word embeddings capture linguistic shifts of terms pertaining to major topics
in this timespan (COVID-19, Croatia joining the European Union, technological
advancements). We also find evidence that embeddings from post-2020 encode
increased positivity in sentiment analysis tasks, contrasting studies reporting
a decline in mental health over the same period.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale
hybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention
mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,
which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters
activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1
million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning
attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time
compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that
require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained
using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including
sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to
M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel
RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling
weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.
Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on
512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just
$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K
thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate
phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our
models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the
original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex
software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly
release MiniMax-M1 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1.

Abstract: Human mobility simulation plays a crucial role in various real-world
applications. Recently, to address the limitations of traditional data-driven
approaches, researchers have explored leveraging the commonsense knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to accelerate human
mobility simulation. However, these methods suffer from several critical
shortcomings, including inadequate modeling of urban spaces and poor
integration with both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility
distributions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{C}ityGPT-Powered
\textbf{A}gentic framework for \textbf{M}obility \textbf{S}imulation
(\textbf{CAMS}), an agentic framework that leverages the language based urban
foundation model to simulate human mobility in urban space. \textbf{CAMS}
comprises three core modules, including MobExtractor to extract template
mobility patterns and synthesize new ones based on user profiles, GeoGenerator
to generate anchor points considering collective knowledge and generate
candidate urban geospatial knowledge using an enhanced version of CityGPT,
TrajEnhancer to retrieve spatial knowledge based on mobility patterns and
generate trajectories with real trajectory preference alignment via DPO.
Experiments on real-world datasets show that \textbf{CAMS} achieves superior
performance without relying on externally provided geospatial information.
Moreover, by holistically modeling both individual mobility patterns and
collective mobility constraints, \textbf{CAMS} generates more realistic and
plausible trajectories. In general, \textbf{CAMS} establishes a new paradigm
that integrates the agentic framework with urban-knowledgeable LLMs for human
mobility simulation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Disease-symptom datasets are significant and in demand for medical research,
disease diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and AI-driven health management
applications. These datasets help identify symptom patterns associated with
specific diseases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early
detection. The dataset presented in this study systematically compiles
disease-symptom relationships from various online sources, medical literature,
and publicly available health databases. The data was gathered through
analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and
disease-symptom association reports. Only the verified medical sources were
included in the dataset, while those from non-peer-reviewed and anecdotal
sources were excluded. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where the
first column represents diseases, and the remaining columns represent symptoms.
Each symptom cell contains a binary value (1 or 0), indicating whether a
symptom is associated with a disease (1 for presence, 0 for absence). Thereby,
this structured representation makes the dataset very useful for a wide range
of applications, including machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical
decision support systems, and epidemiological studies. Although there are some
advancements in the field of disease-symptom datasets, there is a significant
gap in structured datasets for the Bangla language. This dataset aims to bridge
that gap by facilitating the development of multilingual medical informatics
tools and improving disease prediction models for underrepresented linguistic
communities. Further developments should include region-specific diseases and
further fine-tuning of symptom associations for better diagnostic performance

Motivation: The need for reliable evaluation methods for large language models, especially in open-ended and instruction-following tasks, is critical as their capabilities grow.

Method: The paper analyzes key factors affecting the trustworthiness of LLM-as-a-Judge through studies on evaluation design, decoding strategies, and Chain-of-Thought reasoning using BIGGENBench and EvalBiasBench benchmarks.

Result: Evaluation criteria are crucial for reliability, non-deterministic sampling improves alignment with human preferences compared to deterministic methods, and Chain-of-Thought reasoning offers minimal benefits when evaluation criteria are clear.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge depends significantly on evaluation criteria, with non-deterministic sampling and CoT reasoning having varying impacts based on the presence of clear guidelines.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, reliable evaluation
methods are essential particularly for open-ended, instruction-following tasks.
LLM-as-a-Judge enables automatic evaluation using LLMs as evaluators, but its
reliability remains uncertain. In this work, we analyze key factors affecting
its trustworthiness, focusing on alignment with human judgments and evaluation
consistency. Using BIGGENBench and EvalBiasBench, we study the effects of
evaluation design, decoding strategies, and Chain-of-Tought (CoT) reasoning in
evaluation. Our results show that evaluation criteria are critical for
reliability, non-deterministic sampling improves alignment with human
preferences over deterministic evaluation, and CoT reasoning offers minimal
gains when clear evaluation criteria are present.

Abstract: A compelling portrayal of characters is essential to the success of narrative
writing. For readers, appreciating a character's traits requires the ability to
infer their evolving beliefs, desires, and intentions over the course of a
complex storyline, a cognitive skill known as Theory-of-Mind (ToM). Performing
ToM reasoning in prolonged narratives requires readers to integrate historical
context with current narrative information, a task at which humans excel but
Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle. To systematically evaluate LLMs'
ToM reasoning capability in long narratives, we construct LitCharToM, a
benchmark of character-centric questions across four ToM dimensions from
classic literature. Further, we introduce EvolvTrip, a perspective-aware
temporal knowledge graph that tracks psychological development throughout
narratives. Our experiments demonstrate that EvolvTrip consistently enhances
performance of LLMs across varying scales, even in challenging extended-context
scenarios. EvolvTrip proves to be particularly valuable for smaller models,
partially bridging the performance gap with larger LLMs and showing great
compatibility with lengthy narratives. Our findings highlight the importance of
explicit representation of temporal character mental states in narrative
comprehension and offer a foundation for more sophisticated character
understanding. Our data and code are publicly available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become crucial for
rapidly adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks.
Prefix-Tuning, an early and effective PEFT technique, demonstrated the ability
to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly
reduced computational and memory overhead. However, despite its earlier
success, its effectiveness in training modern state-of-the-art LLMs has been
very limited. In this work, we demonstrate empirically that Prefix-Tuning
underperforms on LLMs because of an inherent tradeoff between input and prefix
significance within the attention head. This motivates us to introduce
Prefix-Tuning+, a novel architecture that generalizes the principles of
Prefix-Tuning while addressing its shortcomings by shifting the prefix module
out of the attention head itself. We further provide an overview of our
construction process to guide future users when constructing their own
context-based methods. Our experiments show that, across a diverse set of
benchmarks, Prefix-Tuning+ consistently outperforms existing Prefix-Tuning
methods. Notably, it achieves performance on par with the widely adopted LoRA
method on several general benchmarks, highlighting the potential modern
extension of Prefix-Tuning approaches. Our findings suggest that by overcoming
its inherent limitations, Prefix-Tuning can remain a competitive and relevant
research direction in the landscape of parameter-efficient LLM adaptation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sampling from language models impacts the quality and diversity of outputs,
affecting both research and real-world applications. Recently, Nguyen et al.
2024's "Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM
Outputs" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior
quality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p
sampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's
recognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection
for an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of
the evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the
original paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human
evaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and
described qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p
did not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between
quality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original
paper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task,
and rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve
over baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP
benchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the
number of hyperparameters. Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported.
Fourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars)
were found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised
adoption claim remains misleading. We conclude that evidence presented in the
original paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity,
or a trade-off between quality and diversity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models, many dialogue systems are now
capable of providing reasonable and informative responses to patients' medical
conditions. However, when patients consult their doctor, they may experience
negative emotions due to the severity and urgency of their situation. If the
model can provide appropriate comfort and empathy based on the patient's
negative emotions while answering medical questions, it will likely offer a
more reassuring experience during the medical consultation process. To address
this issue, our paper explores the balance between knowledge sharing and
emotional support in the healthcare dialogue process. We utilize a large
language model to rewrite a real-world interactive medical dialogue dataset,
generating patient queries with negative emotions and corresponding medical
responses aimed at soothing the patient's emotions while addressing their
concerns. The modified data serves to refine the latest large language models
with various fine-tuning methods, enabling them to accurately provide sentences
with both emotional reassurance and constructive suggestions in response to
patients' questions. Compared to the original LLM model, our experimental
results demonstrate that our methodology significantly enhances the model's
ability to generate emotional responses while maintaining its original
capability to provide accurate knowledge-based answers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the effectiveness of latent steering in controlling LLMs, which has been shown to be limited compared to simple instruction prompting.

Method: InstABoost is a latent steering method that alters the model's attention during generation to boost instruction prompting, based on insights from a benchmark across diverse behaviors.

Result: InstABoost shows superior control success compared to traditional prompting and latent steering methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that InstABoost combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by prior work on attention manipulation in transformer-based models for in-context rule following.

Abstract: Controlling the generation of large language models (LLMs) remains a central
challenge to ensure their safe and reliable deployment. While prompt
engineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored
latent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations
to guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's
effectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction
prompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across
diverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building
on insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting
(InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction
prompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost
combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by
prior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based
models can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions.
Empirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both
traditional prompting and latent steering.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically rely on a single fixed
retriever, despite growing evidence that no single retriever performs optimally
across all query types. In this paper, we explore a query routing approach that
dynamically selects from a pool of retrievers based on the query, using both
train-free heuristics and learned routing models. We frame routing as a
learning-to-rank (LTR) problem and introduce LTRR, a framework that learns to
rank retrievers by their expected utility gain to downstream LLM performance.
Our experiments, conducted on synthetic QA data with controlled query type
variations, show that routing-based RAG systems can outperform the best
single-retriever-based systems. Performance gains are especially pronounced in
models trained with the Answer Correctness (AC) metric and with pairwise
learning approaches, especially with XGBoost. We also observe improvements in
generalization to out-of-distribution queries. As part of the SIGIR 2025
LiveRAG challenge, our submitted system demonstrated the practical viability of
our approach, achieving competitive performance in both answer correctness and
faithfulness. These findings highlight the importance of both training
methodology and metric selection in query routing for RAG systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent deep-thinking large language models often reason extensively to
improve performance, but such lengthy reasoning is not always desirable, as it
incurs excessive inference costs with disproportionate performance gains.
Controlling reasoning length without sacrificing performance is therefore
important, but remains challenging, especially under tight thinking budgets. We
propose budget guidance, a simple yet effective method for steering the
reasoning process of LLMs toward a target budget without requiring any LLM
fine-tuning. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor that models a
Gamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token
generation. This signal is then used to guide generation in a soft, token-level
manner, ensuring that the overall reasoning trace adheres to the specified
thinking budget. Budget guidance enables natural control of the thinking
length, along with significant token efficiency improvements over baseline
methods on challenging math benchmarks. For instance, it achieves up to a 26%
accuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark under tight budgets compared to
baseline methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy with only 63% of the
thinking tokens used by the full-thinking model. Budget guidance also
generalizes to broader task domains and exhibits emergent capabilities, such as
estimating question difficulty. The source code is available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as agents, calling
external tools adaptively to solve tasks. Rather than directly calling tools,
it can be more effective for LLMs to write code to perform the tool calls,
enabling them to automatically generate complex control flow such as
conditionals and loops. Such code actions are typically provided as Python
code, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the
ideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and
reliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called
Quasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve
performance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate
hallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate
actions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically
transpiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question
answering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with
Quasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while
reducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing
user approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by
applying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level.

Abstract: Cybersecurity organizations are adapting to GenAI integration through
modified frameworks and hybrid operational processes, with success influenced
by existing security maturity, regulatory requirements, and investments in
human capital and infrastructure. This qualitative research employs systematic
document analysis and comparative case study methodology to examine how
cybersecurity organizations adapt their threat modeling frameworks and
operational processes to address generative artificial intelligence
integration. Through examination of 25 studies from 2022 to 2025, the research
documents substantial transformation in organizational approaches to threat
modeling, moving from traditional signature-based systems toward frameworks
incorporating artificial intelligence capabilities. The research identifies
three primary adaptation patterns: Large Language Model integration for
security applications, GenAI frameworks for risk detection and response
automation, and AI/ML integration for threat hunting. Organizations with mature
security infrastructures, particularly in finance and critical infrastructure
sectors, demonstrate higher readiness through structured governance approaches,
dedicated AI teams, and robust incident response processes. Organizations

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities are rapidly increasing in frequency and complexity,
creating a shifting threat landscape that challenges cybersecurity defenses.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for cybersecurity threat
analysis. When querying LLMs, dealing with new, unseen vulnerabilities is
particularly challenging as it lies outside LLMs' pre-trained distribution.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines mitigate the problem by
injecting up-to-date authoritative sources into the model context, thus
reducing hallucinations and increasing the accuracy in responses. Meanwhile,
the deployment of LLMs in security-sensitive environments introduces challenges
around trust and safety. This raises a critical open question: How to quantify
or attribute the generated response to the retrieved context versus the model's
pre-trained knowledge? This work proposes LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA)
-- a novel, explainable metric to paint a clear picture on the 'percentage of
influence' the pre-trained knowledge vs. retrieved content has for each
generated response. We apply LEA to assess responses to 100 critical CVEs from
the past decade, verifying its effectiveness to quantify the insightfulness for
vulnerability analysis. Our development of LEA reveals a progression of
independency in hidden states of LLMs: heavy reliance on context in early
layers, which enables the derivation of LEA; increased independency in later
layers, which sheds light on why scale is essential for LLM's effectiveness.
This work provides security analysts a means to audit LLM-assisted workflows,
laying the groundwork for transparent, high-assurance deployments of
RAG-enhanced LLMs in cybersecurity operations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly central to agentic systems due
to their strong reasoning and planning capabilities. By interacting with
external environments through predefined tools, these agents can carry out
complex user tasks. Nonetheless, this interaction also introduces the risk of
prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs from external sources can
mislead the agent's behavior, potentially resulting in economic loss, privacy
leakage, or system compromise. System-level defenses have recently shown
promise by enforcing static or predefined policies, but they still face two key
challenges: the ability to dynamically update security rules and the need for
memory stream isolation. To address these challenges, we propose DRIFT, a
Dynamic Rule-based Isolation Framework for Trustworthy agentic systems, which
enforces both control- and data-level constraints. A Secure Planner first
constructs a minimal function trajectory and a JSON-schema-style parameter
checklist for each function node based on the user query. A Dynamic Validator
then monitors deviations from the original plan, assessing whether changes
comply with privilege limitations and the user's intent. Finally, an Injection
Isolator detects and masks any instructions that may conflict with the user
query from the memory stream to mitigate long-term risks. We empirically
validate the effectiveness of DRIFT on the AgentDojo benchmark, demonstrating
its strong security performance while maintaining high utility across diverse
models -- showcasing both its robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a multistage, highly sophisticated,
and covert form of cyber threat that gains unauthorized access to networks to
either steal valuable data or disrupt the targeted network. These threats often
remain undetected for extended periods, emphasizing the critical need for early
detection in networks to mitigate potential APT consequences. In this work, we
propose a feature selection method for developing a lightweight intrusion
detection system capable of effectively identifying APTs at the initial
compromise stage. Our approach leverages the XGBoost algorithm and Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically utilizing the SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanations) method for identifying the most relevant features of the
initial compromise stage. The results of our proposed method showed the ability
to reduce the selected features of the SCVIC-APT-2021 dataset from 77 to just
four while maintaining consistent evaluation metrics for the suggested system.
The estimated metrics values are 97% precision, 100% recall, and a 98% F1
score. The proposed method not only aids in preventing successful APT
consequences but also enhances understanding of APT behavior at early stages.

Motivation: To improve malware semantic analysis and AI model interpretability by incorporating expert knowledge into preprocessing, addressing the limitations of existing AI approaches that focus on data views rather than expert insights.

Method: Proposed a new preprocessing method generating JSON reports for PE files, integrating features from static and behavioral analysis, packer signatures, MITRE ATT&CK, and MBC knowledge to create a semantic representation understandable by analysts.

Result: Achieved a weighted-average F1-score of 0.94 on a complex, realistic dataset when training a Large Language Model for malware classification using the proposed preprocessing.

Conclusion: The preprocessing method enhances AI models' explainability in malware analysis by leveraging expert knowledge, making semantic representations of binaries more accessible to analysts and improving classification accuracy.

Abstract: In a context of malware analysis, numerous approaches rely on Artificial
Intelligence to handle a large volume of data. However, these techniques focus
on data view (images, sequences) and not on an expert's view. Noticing this
issue, we propose a preprocessing that focuses on expert knowledge to improve
malware semantic analysis and result interpretability. We propose a new
preprocessing method which creates JSON reports for Portable Executable files.
These reports gather features from both static and behavioral analysis, and
incorporate packer signature detection, MITRE ATT\&CK and Malware Behavior
Catalog (MBC) knowledge. The purpose of this preprocessing is to gather a
semantic representation of binary files, understandable by malware analysts,
and that can enhance AI models' explainability for malicious files analysis.
Using this preprocessing to train a Large Language Model for Malware
classification, we achieve a weighted-average F1-score of 0.94 on a complex

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains. However, their potential to generate harmful responses has
raised significant societal and regulatory concerns, especially when
manipulated by adversarial techniques known as "jailbreak" attacks. Existing
jailbreak methods typically involve appending carefully crafted prefixes or
suffixes to malicious prompts in order to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms
of these models.
  In this work, we identify a new vulnerability in which excessive linguistic
complexity can disrupt built-in safety mechanisms-without the need for any
added prefixes or suffixes-allowing attackers to elicit harmful outputs
directly. We refer to this phenomenon as Information Overload.
  To automatically exploit this vulnerability, we propose InfoFlood, a
jailbreak attack that transforms malicious queries into complex,
information-overloaded queries capable of bypassing built-in safety mechanisms.
Specifically, InfoFlood: (1) uses linguistic transformations to rephrase
malicious queries, (2) identifies the root cause of failure when an attempt is
unsuccessful, and (3) refines the prompt's linguistic structure to address the
failure while preserving its malicious intent.
  We empirically validate the effectiveness of InfoFlood on four widely used
LLMs-GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini 2.0, and LLaMA 3.1-by measuring their
jailbreak success rates. InfoFlood consistently outperforms baseline attacks,
achieving up to 3 times higher success rates across multiple jailbreak
benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that commonly adopted post-processing
defenses, including OpenAI's Moderation API, Perspective API, and SmoothLLM,
fail to mitigate these attacks. This highlights a critical weakness in
traditional AI safety guardrails when confronted with information
overload-based jailbreaks.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have had a significant
impact on a wide range of fields, from general domains to specialized areas.
However, these advancements have also significantly increased the potential for
malicious users to exploit harmful and jailbreak prompts for malicious attacks.
Although there have been many efforts to prevent harmful prompts and jailbreak
prompts, protecting LLMs from such malicious attacks remains an important and
challenging task. In this paper, we propose QGuard, a simple yet effective
safety guard method, that utilizes question prompting to block harmful prompts
in a zero-shot manner. Our method can defend LLMs not only from text-based
harmful prompts but also from multi-modal harmful prompt attacks. Moreover, by
diversifying and modifying guard questions, our approach remains robust against
the latest harmful prompts without fine-tuning. Experimental results show that
our model performs competitively on both text-only and multi-modal harmful
datasets. Additionally, by providing an analysis of question prompting, we
enable a white-box analysis of user inputs. We believe our method provides
valuable insights for real-world LLM services in mitigating security risks
associated with harmful prompts.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread adoption across
numerous applications. However, many LLMs are vulnerable to malicious attacks
even after safety alignment. These attacks typically bypass LLMs' safety
guardrails by wrapping the original malicious instructions inside adversarial
jailbreaks prompts. Previous research has proposed methods such as adversarial
training and prompt rephrasing to mitigate these safety vulnerabilities, but
these methods often reduce the utility of LLMs or lead to significant
computational overhead and online latency. In this paper, we propose
SecurityLingua, an effective and efficient approach to defend LLMs against
jailbreak attacks via security-oriented prompt compression. Specifically, we
train a prompt compressor designed to discern the "true intention" of the input
prompt, with a particular focus on detecting the malicious intentions of
adversarial prompts. Then, in addition to the original prompt, the intention is
passed via the system prompt to the target LLM to help it identify the true
intention of the request. SecurityLingua ensures a consistent user experience
by leaving the original input prompt intact while revealing the user's
potentially malicious intention and stimulating the built-in safety guardrails
of the LLM. Moreover, thanks to prompt compression, SecurityLingua incurs only
a negligible overhead and extra token cost compared to all existing defense
methods, making it an especially practical solution for LLM defense.
Experimental results demonstrate that SecurityLingua can effectively defend
against malicious attacks and maintain utility of the LLM with negligible
compute and latency overhead. Our code is available at

Abstract: Gaussian blur is widely used to blur human faces in sensitive photos before
the photos are posted on the Internet. However, it is unclear to what extent
the blurred faces can be restored and used to re-identify the person,
especially under a high-blurring setting. In this paper, we explore this
question by developing a deblurring method called Revelio. The key intuition is
to leverage a generative model's memorization effect and approximate the
inverse function of Gaussian blur for face restoration. Compared with existing
methods, we design the deblurring process to be identity-preserving. It uses a
conditional Diffusion model for preliminary face restoration and then uses an
identity retrieval model to retrieve related images to further enhance
fidelity. We evaluate Revelio with large public face image datasets and show
that it can effectively restore blurred faces, especially under a high-blurring
setting. It has a re-identification accuracy of 95.9%, outperforming existing
solutions. The result suggests that Gaussian blur should not be used for face
anonymization purposes. We also demonstrate the robustness of this method
against mismatched Gaussian kernel sizes and functions, and test preliminary
countermeasures and adaptive attacks to inspire future work.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
vision-language alignment capabilities, yet their vulnerability to backdoor
attacks poses critical security risks. Attackers can implant latent triggers
that persist through downstream tasks, enabling malicious control of model
behavior upon trigger presentation. Despite great success in recent defense
mechanisms, they remain impractical due to strong assumptions about attacker
knowledge or excessive clean data requirements. In this paper, we introduce
InverTune, the first backdoor defense framework for multimodal models under
minimal attacker assumptions, requiring neither prior knowledge of attack
targets nor access to the poisoned dataset. Unlike existing defense methods
that rely on the same dataset used in the poisoning stage, InverTune
effectively identifies and removes backdoor artifacts through three key
components, achieving robust protection against backdoor attacks. Specifically,
InverTune first exposes attack signatures through adversarial simulation,
probabilistically identifying the target label by analyzing model response
patterns. Building on this, we develop a gradient inversion technique to
reconstruct latent triggers through activation pattern analysis. Finally, a
clustering-guided fine-tuning strategy is employed to erase the backdoor
function with only a small amount of arbitrary clean data, while preserving the
original model capabilities. Experimental results show that InverTune reduces
the average attack success rate (ASR) by 97.87% against the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) attacks while limiting clean accuracy (CA) degradation to just 3.07%.
This work establishes a new paradigm for securing multimodal systems, advancing
security in foundation model deployment without compromising performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent across
various sectors, raising critical concerns about model ownership and

emerged as a promising solution for model authentication, effective attacks for
removing these fingerprints remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we present
Mismatched Eraser (MEraser), a novel method for effectively removing
backdoor-based fingerprints from LLMs while maintaining model performance. Our
approach leverages a two-phase fine-tuning strategy utilizing carefully
constructed mismatched and clean datasets. Through extensive evaluation across
multiple LLM architectures and fingerprinting methods, we demonstrate that
MEraser achieves complete fingerprinting removal while maintaining model
performance with minimal training data of fewer than 1,000 samples.
Furthermore, we introduce a transferable erasure mechanism that enables
effective fingerprinting removal across different models without repeated
training. In conclusion, our approach provides a practical solution for
fingerprinting removal in LLMs, reveals critical vulnerabilities in current
fingerprinting techniques, and establishes comprehensive evaluation benchmarks
for developing more resilient model protection methods in the future.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, particularly jailbreaking, poses
significant safety and ethical concerns. While numerous jailbreak methods
exist, many suffer from computational expense, high token usage, or complex
decoding schemes. Liu et al. (2024) introduced FlipAttack, a black-box method
that achieves high attack success rates (ASR) through simple prompt
manipulation. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of FlipAttack's
effectiveness by analyzing the semantic changes induced by its flipping modes.
We hypothesize that semantic dissimilarity between original and manipulated
prompts is inversely correlated with ASR. To test this, we examine embedding
space visualizations (UMAP, KDE) and cosine similarities for FlipAttack's
modes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel adversarial attack, Alphabet Index
Mapping (AIM), designed to maximize semantic dissimilarity while maintaining
simple decodability. Experiments on GPT-4 using a subset of AdvBench show AIM
and its variant AIM+FWO achieve a 94% ASR, outperforming FlipAttack and other
methods on this subset. Our findings suggest that while high semantic
dissimilarity is crucial, a balance with decoding simplicity is key for
successful jailbreaking. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of
adversarial prompt mechanics and offers a new, effective jailbreak technique.

Abstract: Federated learning is a promising distributed learning paradigm that enables
collaborative model training without exposing local client data, thereby
protect data privacy. However, it also brings new threats and challenges. The
advancement of model inversion attacks has rendered the plaintext transmission
of local models insecure, while the distributed nature of federated learning
makes it particularly vulnerable to attacks raised by malicious clients. To
protect data privacy and prevent malicious client attacks, this paper proposes
a privacy-preserving federated learning framework based on verifiable
functional encryption, without a non-colluding dual-server setup or additional
trusted third-party. Specifically, we propose a novel decentralized verifiable
functional encryption (DVFE) scheme that enables the verification of specific
relationships over multi-dimensional ciphertexts. This scheme is formally
treated, in terms of definition, security model and security proof.
Furthermore, based on the proposed DVFE scheme, we design a privacy-preserving
federated learning framework VFEFL that incorporates a novel robust aggregation
rule to detect malicious clients, enabling the effective training of
high-accuracy models under adversarial settings. Finally, we provide formal
analysis and empirical evaluation of the proposed schemes. The results
demonstrate that our approach achieves the desired privacy protection,
robustness, verifiability and fidelity, while eliminating the reliance on
non-colluding dual-server settings or trusted third parties required by
existing methods.

Abstract: With the growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs), mobile agents
are now widely used for tasks like UI automation and camera-based user
assistance. These agents are often fine-tuned on limited user-generated
datasets, leaving them vulnerable to covert threats during the training
process. In this work we present GHOST, the first clean-label backdoor attack
specifically designed for mobile agents built upon VLMs. Our method manipulates
only the visual inputs of a portion of the training samples - without altering
their corresponding labels or instructions - thereby injecting malicious
behaviors into the model. Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent
will exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is
introduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the
gradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding
backdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth
and enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static
visual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We
evaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM
architectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves
high attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high
clean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation
studies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and
concealment of the attack. Overall, this work is the first to expose critical
security flaws in VLM-based mobile agents, highlighting their susceptibility to
clean-label backdoor attacks and the urgent need for effective defense

Abstract: This paper presents a formalised architecture for synthetic agents designed
to retain immutable memory, verifiable reasoning, and constrained epistemic
growth. Traditional AI systems rely on mutable, opaque statistical models prone
to epistemic drift and historical revisionism. In contrast, we introduce the
concept of the Merkle Automaton, a cryptographically anchored, deterministic
computational framework that integrates formal automata theory with
blockchain-based commitments. Each agent transition, memory fragment, and
reasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain,
rendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access
and confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges
contextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices. This enforces cryptographic
access control over append-only DAG-structured knowledge graphs. Reasoning is
constrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic
traversal of policy-encoded structures. Updates are non-destructive and
historied, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting.
Zero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion
attestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache
but as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by
cryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent
agent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably
derived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision. This design
lays foundational groundwork for legal, economic, and high-assurance
computational systems that require provable memory, unforgeable provenance, and
structural truth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disassembly is important but hard in binary analysis. Neural disassemblers often have issues with structure, making them less useful.

Method: They use post-dominance relations to set rules for disassembly. This helps find and fix errors in how the models read code.

Result: Tady works well without breaking structure rules and is fast, but still gets the details of each code part right.

Conclusion: Neural disassemblers can be better with these new ideas. Tady shows it's possible to fix structure issues without losing accuracy.

Abstract: Disassembly is a crucial yet challenging step in binary analysis. While
emerging neural disassemblers show promise for efficiency and accuracy, they
frequently generate outputs violating fundamental structural constraints, which
significantly compromise their practical usability. To address this critical
problem, we regularize the disassembly solution space by formalizing and
applying key structural constraints based on post-dominance relations. This
approach systematically detects widespread errors in existing neural
disassemblers' outputs. These errors often originate from models' limited
context modeling and instruction-level decoding that neglect global structural
integrity. We introduce Tady, a novel neural disassembler featuring an improved
model architecture and a dedicated post-processing algorithm, specifically
engineered to address these deficiencies. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse
binaries demonstrate that Tady effectively eliminates structural constraint
violations and functions with high efficiency, while maintaining
instruction-level accuracy.

Abstract: Despite federated learning (FL)'s potential in collaborative learning, its
performance has deteriorated due to the data heterogeneity of distributed
users. Recently, clustered federated learning (CFL) has emerged to address this
challenge by partitioning users into clusters according to their similarity.
However, CFL faces difficulties in training when users are unwilling to share
their cluster identities due to privacy concerns. To address these issues, we
present an innovative Efficient and Robust Secure Aggregation scheme for CFL,
dubbed EBS-CFL. The proposed EBS-CFL supports effectively training CFL while
maintaining users' cluster identity confidentially. Moreover, it detects
potential poisonous attacks without compromising individual client gradients by
discarding negatively correlated gradients and aggregating positively
correlated ones using a weighted approach. The server also authenticates
correct gradient encoding by clients. EBS-CFL has high efficiency with
client-side overhead O(ml + m^2) for communication and O(m^2l) for computation,
where m is the number of cluster identities, and l is the gradient size. When m
= 1, EBS-CFL's computational efficiency of client is at least O(log n) times
better than comparison schemes, where n is the number of clients.In addition,
we validate the scheme through extensive experiments. Finally, we theoretically
prove the scheme's security.

Abstract: Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and persistent
cybersecurity threat with attackers continuously evolving and intensifying
tactics to evade the general detection system. Despite significant advances in

phishing judgments remains challenging. Due to recent advancement in Natural

However, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models
requires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and
trustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key
question remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but
also generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and
internally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned
transformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve
domain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions,
using Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO). To that end, we examined their performance in
phishing classification and explainability by applying the ConsistenCy measure
based on SHAPley values (CC SHAP), which measures prediction explanation token
alignment to test the model's internal faithfulness and consistency and uncover
the rationale behind its predictions and reasoning. Overall, our findings show
that Llama models exhibit stronger prediction explanation token alignment with
higher CC SHAP scores despite lacking reliable decision making accuracy,
whereas Wizard achieves better prediction accuracy but lower CC SHAP scores.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TCN-DPD, a parameter-efficient DPD architecture using temporal convolutional networks with noncausal dilated convolutions and optimized activation functions, achieving high performance with few parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital predistortion (DPD) is crucial for reducing nonlinearity in RF power amplifiers, especially in wideband applications. However, existing models may not be efficient enough, prompting the need for a more parameter-efficient solution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The formal specification and verification of machine learning programs saw
remarkable progress in less than a decade, leading to a profusion of tools.
However, diversity may lead to fragmentation, resulting in tools that are
difficult to compare, except for very specific benchmarks. Furthermore, this
progress is heavily geared towards the specification and verification of a
certain class of property, that is, local robustness properties. But while
provers are becoming more and more efficient at solving local robustness
properties, even slightly more complex properties, involving multiple neural
networks for example, cannot be expressed in the input languages of winners of
the International Competition of Verification of Neural Networks VNN-Comp. In
this tool paper, we present CAISAR, an open-source platform dedicated to
machine learning specification and verification. We present its specification
language, suitable for modelling complex properties on neural networks, support
vector machines and boosted trees. We show on concrete use-cases how
specifications written in this language are automatically translated to queries
to state-of-the-art provers, notably by using automated graph editing
techniques, making it possible to use their off-the-shelf versions. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time continuous learning over streaming data is a central challenge in deep learning and AI systems, with traditional gradient-based models like BPTT facing computational and stability issues with unbounded temporal data.

Method: QIDINNs use the Feynman technique of differentiation under the integral sign to model neural updates as integrals over historical data, providing physically interpretable and computationally tractable learning dynamics.

Result: The model shows effectiveness on synthetic and real-world streaming tasks, with potential for quantum extensions and scalable implementations.

Conclusion: QIDINNs offer a promising approach for stable real-time learning and enable hybrid classical-quantum neural computation.

Abstract: Real-time continuous learning over streaming data remains a central challenge
in deep learning and AI systems. Traditional gradient-based models such as
backpropagation through time (BPTT) face computational and stability
limitations when dealing with temporally unbounded data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel architecture, Quantum-Inspired Differentiable Integral Neural
Networks (QIDINNs), which leverages the Feynman technique of differentiation
under the integral sign to formulate neural updates as integrals over
historical data. This reformulation allows for smoother, more stable learning
dynamics that are both physically interpretable and computationally tractable.
Inspired by Feynman's path integral formalism and compatible with quantum
gradient estimation frameworks, QIDINNs open a path toward hybrid
classical-quantum neural computation. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness
on synthetic and real-world streaming tasks, and we propose directions for
quantum extensions and scalable implementations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) libraries have emerged as the foundational
infrastructure powering today's AI revolution, serving as the backbone for LLM
deployment, inference optimization, fine-tuning, and production serving across
diverse applications. Despite their critical role in the LLM ecosystem, these
libraries face frequent quality issues and bugs that threaten the reliability
of AI systems built upon them. To address this knowledge gap, we present the
first comprehensive empirical investigation into bug characteristics and
testing practices in modern LLM libraries. We examine 313 bug-fixing commits
extracted across two widely-adopted LLM libraries: HuggingFace Transformers and
vLLM.Through rigorous manual analysis, we establish comprehensive taxonomies
categorizing bug symptoms into 5 types and root causes into 14 distinct
categories.Our primary discovery shows that API misuse has emerged as the
predominant root cause (32.17%-48.19%), representing a notable transition from
algorithm-focused defects in conventional deep learning frameworks toward
interface-oriented problems. Additionally, we examine 7,748 test functions to
identify 7 distinct test oracle categories employed in current testing
approaches, with predefined expected outputs (such as specific tensors and text
strings) being the most common strategy. Our assessment of existing testing
effectiveness demonstrates that the majority of bugs escape detection due to
inadequate test cases (41.73%), lack of test drivers (32.37%), and weak test
oracles (25.90%). Drawing from these findings, we offer some recommendations
for enhancing LLM library quality assurance.

Abstract: Code generation is a core capability of large language models (LLMs), yet
mainstream benchmarks (e.g., APPs and LiveCodeBench) contain questions with
medium-level difficulty and pose no challenge to advanced LLMs. To better
reflected the advanced reasoning and code generation ability, We introduce
Humanity's Last Code Exam (HLCE), comprising 235 most challenging problems from
the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC World Finals) and the
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) spanning 2010 - 2024. As part of
HLCE, we design a harmonized online-offline sandbox that guarantees fully
reproducible evaluation. Through our comprehensive evaluation, we observe that
even the strongest reasoning LLMs: o4-mini(high) and Gemini-2.5 Pro, achieve
pass@1 rates of only 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a
novel "self-recognition" task to measure LLMs' awareness of their own
capabilities. Results indicate that LLMs' self-recognition abilities are not
proportionally correlated with their code generation performance. Finally, our
empirical validation of test-time scaling laws reveals that current advanced
LLMs have substantial room for improvement on complex programming tasks. We
expect HLCE to become a milestone challenge for code generation and to catalyze
advances in high-performance reasoning and human-AI collaborative programming.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is not only transforming
software engineering (SE) practice but is also poised to fundamentally disrupt
how research is conducted in the field. While perspectives on this
transformation range from viewing LLMs as mere productivity tools to
considering them revolutionary forces, we argue that the SE research community
must proactively engage with and shape the integration of LLMs into research
practices, emphasizing human agency in this transformation. As LLMs rapidly
become integral to SE research - both as tools that support investigations and
as subjects of study - a human-centric perspective is essential. Ensuring human
oversight and interpretability is necessary for upholding scientific rigor,
fostering ethical responsibility, and driving advancements in the field.
Drawing from discussions at the 2nd Copenhagen Symposium on Human-Centered AI
in SE, this position paper employs McLuhan's Tetrad of Media Laws to analyze
the impact of LLMs on SE research. Through this theoretical lens, we examine
how LLMs enhance research capabilities through accelerated ideation and
automated processes, make some traditional research practices obsolete,
retrieve valuable aspects of historical research approaches, and risk reversal
effects when taken to extremes. Our analysis reveals opportunities for
innovation and potential pitfalls that require careful consideration. We
conclude with a call to action for the SE research community to proactively
harness the benefits of LLMs while developing frameworks and guidelines to
mitigate their risks, to ensure continued rigor and impact of research in an
AI-augmented future.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for interacting with
complex software artifacts, such as software models, through natural language.
They present especially promising benefits for large software models that are
difficult to grasp in their entirety, making traditional interaction and
analysis approaches challenging. This paper investigates two approaches for
leveraging LLMs to answer questions over software models: direct prompting,
where the whole software model is provided in the context, and an agentic
approach combining LLM-based agents with general-purpose file access tools. We
evaluate these approaches using an Ecore metamodel designed for timing analysis
and software optimization in automotive and embedded domains. Our findings show
that while the agentic approach achieves accuracy comparable to direct
prompting, it is significantly more efficient in terms of token usage. This
efficiency makes the agentic approach particularly suitable for the automotive
industry, where the large size of software models makes direct prompting
infeasible, establishing LLM agents as not just a practical alternative but the
only viable solution. Notably, the evaluation was conducted using small LLMs,
which are more feasible to be executed locally - an essential advantage for
meeting strict requirements around privacy, intellectual property protection,
and regulatory compliance. Future work will investigate software models in
diverse formats, explore more complex agent architectures, and extend agentic
workflows to support not only querying but also modification of software
models.

Abstract: [...] Since then, various APR approaches, especially those leveraging the
power of large language models (LLMs), have been rapidly developed to fix
general software bugs. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these advanced
techniques in the context of regression bugs remains largely unexplored. This
gap motivates the need for an empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of
modern APR techniques in fixing real-world regression bugs.
  In this work, we conduct an empirical study of APR techniques on Java
regression bugs. To facilitate our study, we introduce RegMiner4APR, a
high-quality benchmark of Java regression bugs integrated into a framework
designed to facilitate APR research. The current benchmark includes 99
regression bugs collected from 32 widely used real-world Java GitHub
repositories. We begin by conducting an in-depth analysis of the benchmark,
demonstrating its diversity and quality. Building on this foundation, we
empirically evaluate the capabilities of APR to regression bugs by assessing
both traditional APR tools and advanced LLM-based APR approaches. Our
experimental results show that classical APR tools fail to repair any bugs,
while LLM-based APR approaches exhibit promising potential. Motivated by these
results, we investigate impact of incorporating bug-inducing change information
into LLM-based APR approaches for fixing regression bugs. Our results highlight
that this context-aware enhancement significantly improves the performance of
LLM-based APR, yielding 1.8x more successful repairs compared to using
LLM-based APR without such context.

Abstract: This paper explores the growing presence of emotionally responsive artificial
intelligence through a critical and interdisciplinary lens. Bringing together
the voices of early-career researchers from multiple fields, it explores how AI
systems that simulate or interpret human emotions are reshaping our
interactions in areas such as education, healthcare, mental health, caregiving,
and digital life. The analysis is structured around four central themes: the
ethical implications of emotional AI, the cultural dynamics of human-machine
interaction, the risks and opportunities for vulnerable populations, and the
emerging regulatory, design, and technical considerations. The authors
highlight the potential of affective AI to support mental well-being, enhance
learning, and reduce loneliness, as well as the risks of emotional
manipulation, over-reliance, misrepresentation, and cultural bias. Key
challenges include simulating empathy without genuine understanding, encoding
dominant sociocultural norms into AI systems, and insufficient safeguards for
individuals in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Special attention is given to
children, elderly users, and individuals with mental health challenges, who may
interact with AI in emotionally significant ways. However, there remains a lack
of cognitive or legal protections which are necessary to navigate such
engagements safely. The report concludes with ten recommendations, including
the need for transparency, certification frameworks, region-specific
fine-tuning, human oversight, and longitudinal research. A curated

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of calibrating autonomy levels in AI agents to balance transformative potential with risks.

Method: The method involves defining five levels of autonomy based on user roles and exploring control mechanisms and interaction design questions.

Result: The result is a framework for AI autonomy certificates and initial ideas for evaluating agent autonomy.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of autonomy as a deliberate design choice for responsible AI deployment.

Abstract: Autonomy is a double-edged sword for AI agents, simultaneously unlocking
transformative possibilities and serious risks. How can agent developers
calibrate the appropriate levels of autonomy at which their agents should
operate? We argue that an agent's level of autonomy can be treated as a
deliberate design decision, separate from its capability and operational
environment. In this work, we define five levels of escalating agent autonomy,
characterized by the roles a user can take when interacting with an agent:
operator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer. Within each level,
we describe the ways by which a user can exert control over the agent and open
questions for how to design the nature of user-agent interaction. We then
highlight a potential application of our framework towards AI autonomy
certificates to govern agent behavior in single- and multi-agent systems. We
conclude by proposing early ideas for evaluating agents' autonomy. Our work
aims to contribute meaningful, practical steps towards responsibly deployed and
useful AI agents in the real world.

Abstract: Dynamic facial emotion is essential for believable AI-generated avatars;
however, most systems remain visually inert, limiting their utility in
high-stakes simulations such as virtual training for investigative interviews
with abused children. We introduce and evaluate a real-time architecture fusing
Unreal Engine 5 MetaHuman rendering with NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face to
translate vocal prosody into high-fidelity facial expressions on photorealistic
child avatars. We implemented a distributed two-PC setup that decouples
language processing and speech synthesis from GPU-intensive rendering, designed
to support low-latency interaction in desktop and VR environments. A
between-subjects study ($N=70$) using audio+visual and visual-only conditions
assessed perceptual impacts as participants rated emotional clarity, facial
realism, and empathy for two avatars expressing joy, sadness, and anger.
  Results demonstrate that avatars could express emotions recognizably, with
sadness and joy achieving high identification rates. However, anger recognition
significantly dropped without audio, highlighting the importance of congruent
vocal cues for high-arousal emotions. Interestingly, removing audio boosted
perceived facial realism, suggesting that audiovisual desynchrony remains a key
design challenge. These findings confirm the technical feasibility of
generating emotionally expressive avatars and provide guidance for improving
non-verbal communication in sensitive training simulations.

Result: Agent-supported users generated more feasible designs compared to non-supported users, with different impacts from various support strategies.

Conclusion: The study highlights opportunities and tradeoffs of metacognitive support agents, suggesting considerations for future AI-based design tools to improve integration and effectiveness.

Abstract: Despite the potential of generative AI (GenAI) design tools to enhance design
processes, professionals often struggle to integrate AI into their workflows.
Fundamental cognitive challenges include the need to specify all design
criteria as distinct parameters upfront (intent formulation) and designers'
reduced cognitive involvement in the design process due to cognitive
offloading, which can lead to insufficient problem exploration,
underspecification, and limited ability to evaluate outcomes. Motivated by
these challenges, we envision novel metacognitive support agents that assist
designers in working more reflectively with GenAI. To explore this vision, we
conducted exploratory prototyping through a Wizard of Oz elicitation study with
20 mechanical designers probing multiple metacognitive support strategies. We
found that agent-supported users created more feasible designs than
non-supported users, with differing impacts between support strategies. Based
on these findings, we discuss opportunities and tradeoffs of metacognitive
support agents and considerations for future AI-based design tools.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often exhibit learning behaviors that are
not intuitively interpretable by human observers, which can result in
suboptimal feedback in collaborative teaching settings. Yet, how humans
perceive and interpret RL agent's learning behavior is largely unknown. In a
bottom-up approach with two experiments, this work provides a data-driven
understanding of the factors of human observers' understanding of the agent's
learning process. A novel, observation-based paradigm to directly assess human
inferences about agent learning was developed. In an exploratory interview
study (\textit{N}=9), we identify four core themes in human interpretations:
Agent Goals, Knowledge, Decision Making, and Learning Mechanisms. A second
confirmatory study (\textit{N}=34) applied an expanded version of the paradigm
across two tasks (navigation/manipulation) and two RL algorithms
(tabular/function approximation). Analyses of 816 responses confirmed the
reliability of the paradigm and refined the thematic framework, revealing how
these themes evolve over time and interrelate. Our findings provide a
human-centered understanding of how people make sense of agent learning,
offering actionable insights for designing interpretable RL systems and
improving transparency in Human-Robot Interaction.

Abstract: Spatial audio is essential for enhancing the immersiveness of audio-visual
experiences, yet its production typically demands complex recording systems and
specialized expertise. In this work, we address a novel problem of generating
first-order ambisonics, a widely used spatial audio format, directly from
silent videos. To support this task, we introduce YT-Ambigen, a dataset
comprising 102K 5-second YouTube video clips paired with corresponding
first-order ambisonics. We also propose new evaluation metrics to assess the
spatial aspect of generated audio based on audio energy maps and saliency
metrics. Furthermore, we present Video-to-Spatial Audio Generation (ViSAGe), an
end-to-end framework that generates first-order ambisonics from silent video
frames by leveraging CLIP visual features, autoregressive neural audio codec
modeling with both directional and visual guidance. Experimental results
demonstrate that ViSAGe produces plausible and coherent first-order ambisonics,
outperforming two-stage approaches consisting of video-to-audio generation and
audio spatialization. Qualitative examples further illustrate that ViSAGe
generates temporally aligned high-quality spatial audio that adapts to
viewpoint changes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-trained audio networks have seen widespread adoption in
real-world systems, particularly in multi-modal large language models. These
networks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the
SSL pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio.
However, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform
in real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex,
involving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio SSL methods are
often benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as
environmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to
generalize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios,
remains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical
robustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap,
we introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel
direction in audio SSL research, designed to improve, designed to improve the
model's ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong
performance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio
SSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a
comprehensive comparative analysis against SOTA methods using a range of
high-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets. SSLAM not only improves
model performance on polyphonic audio, but also maintains or exceeds
performance on standard audio SSL benchmarks. Notably, it achieves up to a
3.9\% improvement on the AudioSet-2M (AS-2M), reaching a mean average precision
(mAP) of 50.2. For polyphonic datasets, SSLAM sets new SOTA in both linear
evaluation and fine-tuning regimes with performance improvements of up to 9.1\%
(mAP).

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversations (MERC) aims to infer the
speaker's emotional state by analyzing utterance information from multiple
sources (i.e., video, audio, and text). Compared with unimodality, a more
robust utterance representation can be obtained by fusing complementary
semantic information from different modalities. However, the modality missing
problem severely limits the performance of MERC in practical scenarios. Recent
work has achieved impressive performance on modality completion using graph
neural networks and diffusion models, respectively. This inspires us to combine
these two dimensions through the graph diffusion model to obtain more powerful
modal recovery capabilities. Unfortunately, existing graph diffusion models may
destroy the connectivity and local structure of the graph by directly adding
Gaussian noise to the adjacency matrix, resulting in the generated graph data
being unable to retain the semantic and topological information of the original
graph. To this end, we propose a novel Graph Spectral Diffusion Network
(GSDNet), which maps Gaussian noise to the graph spectral space of missing
modalities and recovers the missing data according to its original
distribution. Compared with previous graph diffusion methods, GSDNet only
affects the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix instead of destroying the
adjacency matrix directly, which can maintain the global topological
information and important spectral features during the diffusion process.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GSDNet achieves state-of-the-art
emotion recognition performance in various modality loss scenarios.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current streaming TTS systems, which have high computational costs and suboptimal performance due to multi-stage pipelines and discrete representations, making them unsuitable for real-time applications.

Method: The method involves proposing StreamMel, a single-stage framework that models continuous mel-spectrograms by interleaving text tokens with acoustic frames, allowing for low-latency autoregressive synthesis.

Result: Experiments on LibriSpeech show that StreamMel outperforms existing streaming TTS baselines in quality and latency, achieving performance comparable to offline systems while enabling efficient real-time generation.

Conclusion: StreamMel demonstrates broad prospects for integration with real-time speech large language models, offering a promising solution for efficient and high-quality streaming TTS.

Abstract: Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis have achieved
high-quality speech generation for unseen speakers, but most systems remain
unsuitable for real-time applications because of their offline design. Current
streaming TTS paradigms often rely on multi-stage pipelines and discrete
representations, leading to increased computational cost and suboptimal system
performance. In this work, we propose StreamMel, a pioneering single-stage
streaming TTS framework that models continuous mel-spectrograms. By
interleaving text tokens with acoustic frames, StreamMel enables low-latency,
autoregressive synthesis while preserving high speaker similarity and
naturalness. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that StreamMel outperforms
existing streaming TTS baselines in both quality and latency. It even achieves

TL;DR: The paper proposes SC-SOT, an enhanced training method for E2E multi-talker ASR that explicitly conditions the decoder on speaker information, improving performance on overlapped speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the handling of overlapped speech in end-to-end multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems by addressing the limitations of existing implicit speaker separation methods.

Method: SC-SOT enhances the decoder with speaker embeddings and speaker activity information, derived from a jointly trained E2E speaker diarization model, to explicitly condition on speaker details.

Result: Experiments show that the conditioning approach in SC-SOT effectively improves the performance of E2E multi-talker ASR on overlapped speech scenarios.

Conclusion: SC-SOT provides a more reliable way to handle overlapped speech by explicitly incorporating speaker information, reducing the need for speaker enrollment and enhancing recognition accuracy.

Abstract: We propose Speaker-Conditioned Serialized Output Training (SC-SOT), an
enhanced SOT-based training for E2E multi-talker ASR. We first probe how SOT
handles overlapped speech, and we found the decoder performs implicit speaker
separation. We hypothesize this implicit separation is often insufficient due
to ambiguous acoustic cues in overlapping regions. To address this, SC-SOT
explicitly conditions the decoder on speaker information, providing detailed
information about "who spoke when". Specifically, we enhance the decoder by
incorporating: (1) speaker embeddings, which allow the model to focus on the
acoustic characteristics of the target speaker, and (2) speaker activity
information, which guides the model to suppress non-target speakers. The
speaker embeddings are derived from a jointly trained E2E speaker diarization
model, mitigating the need for speaker enrollment. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our conditioning approach on overlapped
speech.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive systematic review of literature
on style-based composer identification and authorship attribution in symbolic
music scores. Addressing the critical need for improved reliability and
reproducibility in this field, the review rigorously analyzes 58 peer-reviewed
papers published across various historical periods, with the search adapted to
evolving terminology. The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires,
computational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting
significant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing
research suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on
simple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the
credibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like
Balanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results
is emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the
evolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship
attribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin
Desprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the
opportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve
disputed musical provenance. Based on these insights, a set of actionable
guidelines for future research are proposed. These recommendations are designed
to significantly enhance the reliability, reproducibility, and musicological
validity of composer identification and authorship attribution studies,
fostering more robust and interpretable computational stylistic analysis.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Numerous tools for neural network inference are currently available, yet many
do not meet the requirements of real-time audio applications. In response, we
introduce anira, an efficient cross-platform library. To ensure compatibility
with a broad range of neural network architectures and frameworks, anira
supports ONNX Runtime, LibTorch, and TensorFlow Lite as backends. Each
inference engine exhibits real-time violations, which anira mitigates by
decoupling the inference from the audio callback to a static thread pool. The
library incorporates built-in latency management and extensive benchmarking
capabilities, both crucial to ensure a continuous signal flow. Three different
neural network architectures for audio effect emulation are then subjected to
benchmarking across various configurations. Statistical modeling is employed to
identify the influence of various factors on performance. The findings indicate
that for stateless models, ONNX Runtime exhibits the lowest runtimes. For
stateful models, LibTorch demonstrates the fastest performance. Our results
also indicate that for certain model-engine combinations, the initial
inferences take longer, particularly when these inferences exhibit a higher
incidence of real-time violations.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing
parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and
expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure.
Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory
bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable
workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires
fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces
Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in
the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910C
NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified
Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling
of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive
operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed
key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose
CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core
innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales
prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy
supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware
optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and
INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows
CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of
6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms
TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s
even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization
maintains model accuracy across benchmarks.

Abstract: Distributed computing systems are essential for meeting the demands of modern

presents significant challenges. Misallocating resources in shared systems can
lead to resource contention, system instability, degraded performance, priority
inversion, inefficient utilization, increased latency, and environmental
impact.
  We present BanditWare, an online recommendation system that dynamically
selects the most suitable hardware for applications using a contextual
multi-armed bandit algorithm. BanditWare balances exploration and exploitation,
gradually refining its hardware recommendations based on observed application
performance while continuing to explore potentially better options. Unlike
traditional statistical and machine learning approaches that rely heavily on
large historical datasets, BanditWare operates online, learning and adapting in
real-time as new workloads arrive.
  We evaluated BanditWare on three workflow applications: Cycles (an
agricultural science scientific workflow) BurnPro3D (a web-based platform for
fire science) and a matrix multiplication application. Designed for seamless
integration with the National Data Platform (NDP), BanditWare enables users of
all experience levels to optimize resource allocation efficiently.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Equivariant and invariant machine learning models exploit symmetries and
structural patterns in data to improve sample efficiency. While empirical
studies suggest that data-driven methods such as regularization and data
augmentation can perform comparably to explicitly invariant models, theoretical
insights remain scarce. In this paper, we provide a theoretical comparison of
three approaches for achieving invariance: data augmentation, regularization,
and hard-wiring. We focus on mean squared error regression with deep linear
networks, which parametrize rank-bounded linear maps and can be hard-wired to
be invariant to specific group actions. We show that the critical points of the
optimization problems for hard-wiring and data augmentation are identical,
consisting solely of saddles and the global optimum. By contrast,
regularization introduces additional critical points, though they remain
saddles except for the global optimum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
regularization path is continuous and converges to the hard-wired solution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social
choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency,
and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF
perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties?
In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and
empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy
pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently
satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for
RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight
modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or
Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving
the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and
social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference
matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better
reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while
RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We
conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy
all three.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new way to calculate the exact posterior score for denoising tasks using the unconditional score function, allowing for better error control and fewer steps in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve conditional sampling in diffusion models for image restoration and inverse problems by addressing the limitations of existing methods like DPS.

Method: The method involves deriving a novel expression for the exact posterior score in terms of the unconditional score function and using it to analyze time-dependent errors in DPS, adjusting step sizes dynamically.

Result: The result shows that the approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and achieves better performance with fewer time steps compared to DPS.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed method offers a simpler and more efficient solution for diffusion models in denoising and related inverse tasks, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has driven interest in performing conditional
sampling via training-free guidance of the denoising process to solve image
restoration and other inverse problems. A popular class of methods, based on
Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable
posterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression
for the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in
terms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze
the time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step
sizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that
these step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as
colorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity,
this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables
sampling with fewer time steps than DPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing group-fair clustering methods which require predefined cluster numbers and distances, making them less flexible for different data types and scenarios.

Method: The method involves proposing a fair Bayesian model-based clustering approach called FBC, which uses a specially designed prior that concentrates on fair clusters and an efficient MCMC algorithm for inference.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FBC can reasonably infer the number of clusters, achieve a competitive utility-fairness trade-off, and perform well on categorical data.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that FBC offers advantages in inferring cluster numbers and applying to diverse data types, providing a flexible and effective solution for fair clustering in machine learning.

Abstract: Fair clustering has become a socially significant task with the advancement
of machine learning technologies and the growing demand for trustworthy AI.
Group fairness ensures that the proportions of each sensitive group are similar
in all clusters. Most existing group-fair clustering methods are based on the
$K$-means clustering and thus require the distance between instances and the
number of clusters to be given in advance. To resolve this limitation, we
propose a fair Bayesian model-based clustering called Fair Bayesian Clustering
(FBC). We develop a specially designed prior which puts its mass only on fair
clusters, and implement an efficient MCMC algorithm. Advantages of FBC are that
it can infer the number of clusters and can be applied to any data type as long
as the likelihood is defined (e.g., categorical data). Experiments on
real-world datasets show that FBC (i) reasonably infers the number of clusters,
(ii) achieves a competitive utility-fairness trade-off compared to existing
fair clustering methods, and (iii) performs well on categorical data.

Motivation: The need for high-precision orbital data is increasing due to LEO satellite growth, but there's a lack of real-world datasets for research on maneuver prediction and collision risk.

Result: The dataset enables more realistic modeling of space object behavior and provides insights into maneuver detection methods and collision risk evaluation in crowded orbits.

Conclusion: The paper addresses the data gap by creating a practical dataset that supports research in space object maneuver prediction and collision risk assessment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of aerospace technology and the large-scale
deployment of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, the challenges
facing astronomical observations and deep space exploration have become
increasingly pronounced. As a result, the demand for high-precision orbital
data on space objects-along with comprehensive analyses of satellite
positioning, constellation configurations, and deep space satellite
dynamics-has grown more urgent. However, there remains a notable lack of
publicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as
space object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This
study seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative
dataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset
integrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding
high-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and
multidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable
insights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the
evaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unique structure of Rényi-geometry and its relation to existing geometries like Amari's α-geometry, and to explore prior distributions in statistical manifolds.

Method: Deriving metric tensors, dual parametrized connections, dual Laplacians, and analyzing reparameterization to relate Rényi-priors to α-priors and Hartigan's priors.

Result: Rényi-geometry differs from Amari's α-geometry; Rényi-priors can coincide with α-priors via reparameterization, and Hartigan's α_H priors are equivalent to Rénnyi's ρ priors.

Conclusion: The study establishes the distinctness of Rényi-geometry from α-geometry and connects Rényi-priors to established statistical priors through reparameterization, highlighting significance in statistical theory.

Abstract: We derive the information geometry induced by the statistical R\'enyi
divergence, namely its metric tensor, its dual parametrized connections, as
well as its dual Laplacians. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the
R\'enyi-geometry, though closely related, differs in structure from Amari's
well-known $\alpha$-geometry. Subsequently, we derive the canonical uniform
prior distributions for a statistical manifold endowed with a R\'enyi-geometry,
namely the dual R\'enyi-covolumes. We find that the R\'enyi-priors can be made
to coincide with Takeuchi and Amari's $\alpha$-priors by a reparameterization,
which is itself of particular significance in statistics. Herewith, we
demonstrate that Hartigan's parametrized ($\alpha_H$) family of priors is
precisely the parametrized ($\rho$) family of R\'enyi-priors ($\alpha_H =
\rho$).

Abstract: This paper develops a general inferential framework for discrete copulas on
finite supports in any dimension. The copula of a multivariate discrete
distribution is defined as Csiszar's I-projection (i.e., the
minimum-Kullback-Leibler divergence projection) of its joint probability array
onto the polytope of uniform-margins probability arrays of the same size, and
its empirical estimator is obtained by applying that same projection to the
array of empirical frequencies observed on the sample. Under the assumption of
random sampling, strong consistency and root-n-asymptotic normality of the
empirical copula array is established, with an explicit "sandwich" form for its
covariance. The theory is illustrated by deriving the large-sample distribution
of Yule's concordance coefficient (the natural analogue of Spearman's rho for
bivariate discrete distributions) and by constructing a test for

Abstract: Sparse linear regression methods such as Lasso require a tuning parameter
that depends on the noise variance, which is typically unknown and difficult to
estimate in practice. In the presence of heavy-tailed noise or adversarial
outliers, this problem becomes more challenging. In this paper, we propose an
estimator for robust and sparse linear regression that eliminates the need for
explicit prior knowledge of the noise scale. Our method builds on the Huber
loss and incorporates an iterative scheme that alternates between coefficient
estimation and adaptive noise calibration via median-of-means. The approach is
theoretically grounded and achieves sharp non-asymptotic error bounds under
both sub-Gaussian and heavy-tailed noise assumptions. Moreover, the proposed
method accommodates arbitrary outlier contamination in the response without
requiring prior knowledge of the number of outliers or the sparsity level.
While previous robust estimators avoid tuning parameters related to the noise
scale or sparsity, our procedure achieves comparable error bounds when the
number of outliers is unknown, and improved bounds when it is known. In
particular, the improved bounds match the known minimax lower bounds up to
constant factors.

Abstract: This article investigates the asymptotic distribution of penalized estimators
with non-differentiable penalties designed to recover low-dimensional
structures; that is, subspaces in which the true parameter lies. We study the
asymptotic distribution of the scaled estimation error in the regime where the
parameter dimension p is fixed and the number of observations n tends to
infinity. Our focus is on the asymptotic probability of pattern recovery, a
question not addressed by classical results for the LASSO. In our recent work,
we derived such results for the LASSO and broader classes of penalties,
including non-separable ones such as SLOPE, within the standard linear model.
We now extend this analysis to general loss functions, including, for example,
robust regression with Huber and quantile loss functions, as well as
generalized linear models from the exponential family. The main contribution of
the paper is the development of an asymptotic framework for pattern convergence
of regularized M-estimators under general loss functions that satisfy a
suitable stochastic differentiability condition. The proofs rely on tools from
empirical process theory, including Donsker classes and VC-dimension
techniques.

Abstract: We propose a novel statistical inference framework for streaming principal
component analysis (PCA) using Oja's algorithm, enabling the construction of
confidence intervals for individual entries of the estimated eigenvector. Most
existing works on streaming PCA focus on providing sharp sin-squared error
guarantees. Recently, there has been some interest in uncertainty
quantification for the sin-squared error. However, uncertainty quantification
or sharp error guarantees for entries of the estimated eigenvector in the
streaming setting remains largely unexplored. We derive a sharp Bernstein-type
concentration bound for elements of the estimated vector matching the optimal
error rate up to logarithmic factors. We also establish a Central Limit Theorem
for a suitably centered and scaled subset of the entries. To efficiently
estimate the coordinate-wise variance, we introduce a provably consistent
subsampling algorithm that leverages the median-of-means approach, empirically
achieving similar accuracy to multiplier bootstrap methods while being
significantly more computationally efficient. Numerical experiments demonstrate
its effectiveness in providing reliable uncertainty estimates with a fraction
of the computational cost of existing methods.

Motivation: To develop a lower bound on Wasserstein variance for estimators, enhancing robustness against noise.

Method: Investigating conditions for asymptotic Wasserstein efficiency and analyzing Wasserstein estimators in location-scale families.

Result: Found conditions for Wasserstein efficiency, showing existence of such estimators for one-parameter models and their efficiency in location-scale families.

Conclusion: The Wasserstein estimator is asymptotically efficient in location-scale families, linking to e-geodesics and potential robustness improvements.

Abstract: Recently, a Wasserstein analogue of the Cramer--Rao inequality has been
developed using the Wasserstein information matrix (Otto metric). This
inequality provides a lower bound on the Wasserstein variance of an estimator,
which quantifies its robustness against additive noise. In this study, we
investigate conditions for an estimator to attain the Wasserstein--Cramer--Rao
lower bound (asymptotically), which we call the (asymptotic) Wasserstein
efficiency. We show a condition under which Wasserstein efficient estimators
exist for one-parameter statistical models. This condition corresponds to a
recently proposed Wasserstein analogue of one-parameter exponential families
(e-geodesics). We also show that the Wasserstein estimator, a Wasserstein
analogue of the maximum likelihood estimator based on the Wasserstein score
function, is asymptotically Wasserstein efficient in location-scale families.

Abstract: In 2017 Jordanova and co-authors consider probabilities for p-outside values,
and later on, they use them in order to construct distribution sensitive IPO
estimators. These works do not take into account the asymmetry of the
distribution. This shortcoming was recently overcome and the corresponding
probabilities for asymmetric p-outside values, together with the so-called IAPO
estimators, were defined. Here we apply these results to Exponentiated-Frechet
distribution, introduced in 2003 by Nadarajah and Kotz. The abbreviation "IAPO"
comes from "Inverse Probabilities for Asymmetric P-Outside Values". These
estimators use as an auxiliary characteristic the empirical asymmetric
$p$-fences. In this way, the system relating the estimated parameters and the
asymmetric probabilities for $p$-outside values has an easier solution. The
comparison with our previous study about the corresponding IPO and IPO-NM
estimators shows that IAPO estimators give better results for the index of
regular variation of the right tail of the cumulative distribution function. A
simulation study depicts their rates of convergence, and finishes this work.

Abstract: Traditional covariate selection methods for causal inference focus on
achieving unbiasedness and asymptotic efficiency. In many practical scenarios,
researchers must estimate causal effects from observational data with limited
sample sizes or in cases where covariates are difficult or costly to measure.
Their needs might be better met by selecting adjustment sets that are finite
sample-optimal in terms of mean squared error. In this paper, we aim to find
the adjustment set that minimizes the mean squared error of the causal effect
estimator, taking into account the joint distribution of the variables and the
sample size. We call this finite sample-optimal set the MSE-optimal adjustment
set and present examples in which the MSE-optimal adjustment set differs from
the asymptotically optimal adjustment set. To identify the MSE-optimal
adjustment set, we then introduce a sample size criterion for comparing
adjustment sets in linear Gaussian models. We also develop graphical criteria
to reduce the search space for this adjustment set based on the causal graph.
In experiments with simulated data, we show that the MSE-optimal adjustment set
can outperform the asymptotically optimal adjustment set in finite sample size
settings, making causal inference more practical in such scenarios.

Conclusion: The theoretical findings are validated through simulations, providing insights into the asymptotic properties of such ratios.

Abstract: We consider the limiting distribution of the quantity $X^s/(X+Y)^r$, where
$X$ and $Y$ are two independent Binomial random variables with a common success

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Estimating high-dimensional precision matrices is a fundamental problem in
modern statistics, with the graphical lasso and its $\ell_1$-penalty being a
standard approach for recovering sparsity patterns. However, many statistical
models, e.g. colored graphical models, exhibit richer structures like symmetry
or equality constraints, which the $\ell_1$-norm cannot adequately capture.
This paper addresses the gap by extending the high-dimensional analysis of
pattern recovery to a general class of atomic norm penalties, particularly
those whose unit balls are polytopes, where patterns correspond to the
polytope's facial structure. We establish theoretical guarantees for recovering
the true pattern induced by these general atomic norms in precision matrix
estimation.
  Our framework builds upon and refines the primal-dual witness methodology of
Ravikumar et al. (2011). Our analysis provides conditions on the deviation
between sample and true covariance matrices for successful pattern recovery,
given a novel, generalized irrepresentability condition applicable to any
atomic norm. When specialized to the $\ell_1$-penalty, our results offer
improved conditions -- including weaker deviation requirements and a less
restrictive irrepresentability condition -- leading to tighter bounds and
better asymptotic performance than prior work. The proposed general
irrepresentability condition, based on a new thresholding concept, provides a
unified perspective on model selection consistency. Numerical examples
demonstrate the tightness of the derived theoretical bounds.

Abstract: Two directed graphs are called covariance equivalent if they induce the same
set of covariance matrices, up to a Lebesgue measure zero set, on the random
variables of their associated linear structural equation models. For acyclic
graphs, covariance equivalence is characterized both structurally, via
essential graphs and characteristic imsets, and transformationally, through
sequences of covered edge flips. However, when cycles are allowed, only a
transformational characterization of covariance equivalence has been
discovered. We consider a linear map whose fibers correspond to the sets of
graphs with identical characteristic imset vectors, and study the toric ideal
associated to its integer matrix. Using properties of this ideal we show that
directed graphs with the same characteristic imset vectors are covariance
equivalent. In applications, imsets form a smaller search space for solving
causal discovery via greedy search.

Abstract: In many high-dimensional problems, like sparse-PCA, planted clique, or
clustering, the best known algorithms with polynomial time complexity fail to
reach the statistical performance provably achievable by algorithms free of
computational constraints. This observation has given rise to the conjecture of
the existence, for some problems, of gaps -- so called
statistical-computational gaps -- between the best possible statistical
performance achievable without computational constraints, and the best
performance achievable with poly-time algorithms. A powerful approach to assess
the best performance achievable in poly-time is to investigate the best
performance achievable by polynomials with low-degree. We build on the seminal
paper of Schramm and Wein (2022) and propose a new scheme to derive lower
bounds on the performance of low-degree polynomials in some latent space
models. By better leveraging the latent structures, we obtain new and sharper
results, with simplified proofs. We then instantiate our scheme to provide
computational lower bounds for the problems of clustering, sparse clustering,
and biclustering. We also prove matching upper-bounds and some additional
statistical results, in order to provide a comprehensive description of the
statistical-computational gaps occurring in these three problems.

results by mitigating loss of variance due to sampling errors. We also analyze
the suitability of several machine learning models and the balance between
accuracy and computational cost of the covariance estimations. We introduce two
distance-free localization techniques leveraging machine learning methods
specifically tailored for tabular data. The methods are integrated into the
Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework. The

enhance data assimilation and uncertainty quantification results. We observe
reduced variance loss for the input variables using the proposed methods.
Furthermore, we compare several machine learning models, assessing their
suitability for the problem in terms of computational cost, and quality of the
covariance estimation and data match. The influence of ensemble size is also
investigated, providing insights into balancing accuracy and computational
efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that certain machine learning models are
more suitable for this problem. This study introduces two novel methods that
mitigate variance loss for model parameters in ensemble-based data
assimilation, offering practical solutions that are easy to implement and do
not require any additional numerical simulation or hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is crucial for navigational safety,
route optimization, traffic management, search and rescue operations, and
autonomous navigation. Traditional data-driven models lack real-world physical
constraints, leading to forecasts that disobey vessel motion dynamics, such as
in scenarios with limited or noisy data where sudden course changes or speed
variations occur due to external factors. To address this limitation, we
propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach for trajectory
prediction that integrates a streamlined kinematic model for vessel motion into
the neural network training process via a first- and second-order, finite
difference physics-based loss function. This loss function, discretized using
the first-order forward Euler method, Heun's second-order approximation, and
refined with a midpoint approximation based on Taylor series expansion,
enforces fidelity to fundamental physical principles by penalizing deviations
from expected kinematic behavior. We evaluated PINN using real-world AIS
datasets that cover diverse maritime conditions and compared it with
state-of-the-art models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method
reduces average displacement errors by up to 32% across models and datasets
while maintaining physical consistency. These results enhance model reliability
and adherence to mission-critical maritime activities, where precision
translates into better situational awareness in the oceans.

elucidate the impacts of these factors on academic performance. We constructed
a hypothetical causal graph and collected data from 1,050 student profiles.
Following meticulous data cleaning and visualization, we analyze linear
relationships through correlation and variable plots, and perform causal
analysis on the hypothetical graph. Regression and classification models are
applied for prediction, and unsupervised causality analysis using PC, GES,
ICA-LiNGAM, and GRASP algorithms is conducted. Our regression analysis shows
that Ridge Regression achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.12 and a Mean
Squared Error (MSE) of 0.024, indicating robustness, while classification
models like Random Forest achieve nearly perfect F1-scores. The causal analysis
shows significant direct and indirect effects of factors such as class
attendance, study hours, and group study on CGPA. These insights are validated
through unsupervised causality analysis. By integrating the best regression
model into a web application, we are developing a practical tool for students
and educators to enhance academic outcomes based on empirical evidence.

In this scenario, statistical heterogeneity and data noise can create spurious
correlations, leading to biased feature learning and catastrophic forgetting.
Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets
of previous tasks. However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic
forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL.

Abstract: The design of fair and efficient algorithms for allocating public resources,

impact. In one-sided matching problems, where individuals are assigned to items
based on ranked preferences, a fundamental trade-off exists between efficiency
and strategyproofness. Existing algorithms like Random Serial Dictatorship
(RSD), Probabilistic Serial (PS), and Rank Minimization (RM) capture only one
side of this trade-off: RSD is strategyproof but inefficient, while PS and RM
are efficient but incentivize manipulation. We propose EMERGENT, a novel
application of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to one-sided matching,
leveraging its ability to sample diverse, high-reward solutions. In our
approach, efficient and manipulation-resistant matches emerge naturally:
high-reward solutions yield efficient matches, while the stochasticity of
GFlowNets-based outputs reduces incentives for manipulation. Experiments show
that EMERGENT outperforms RSD in rank efficiency while significantly reducing
strategic vulnerability compared to matches produced by RM and PS. Our work
highlights the potential of GFlowNets for applications involving social choice
mechanisms, where it is crucial to balance efficiency and manipulability.

Abstract: Masked autoregressive (MAR) models unify the strengths of masked and
autoregressive generation by predicting tokens in a fixed order using
bidirectional attention for image generation. While effective, MAR models
suffer from significant computational overhead, as they recompute attention and
feed-forward representations for all tokens at every decoding step, despite
most tokens remaining semantically stable across steps. We propose a
training-free generation framework MARch\'e to address this inefficiency
through two key components: cache-aware attention and selective KV refresh.
Cache-aware attention partitions tokens into active and cached sets, enabling
separate computation paths that allow efficient reuse of previously computed
key/value projections without compromising full-context modeling. But a cached
token cannot be used indefinitely without recomputation due to the changing
contextual information over multiple steps. MARch\'e recognizes this challenge
and applies a technique called selective KV refresh. Selective KV refresh
identifies contextually relevant tokens based on attention scores from newly
generated tokens and updates only those tokens that require recomputation,
while preserving image generation quality. MARch\'e significantly reduces
redundant computation in MAR without modifying the underlying architecture.
Empirically, MARch\'e achieves up to 1.7x speedup with negligible impact on
image quality, offering a scalable and broadly applicable solution for
efficient masked transformer generation.

TL;DR: Recent work uses RL to improve text-to-image diffusion models, but existing approaches are complex.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the 'golden noise' hypothesis, which suggests that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield better text-image alignment and quality.

Method: Noise PPO is a minimalist RL algorithm that keeps the pre-trained diffusion model frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. It does not require trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance techniques.

Result: Experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution improves alignment and sample quality compared to the original model, with significant gains at low inference steps. The benefits decrease with more inference steps but still remain.

Conclusion: The study supports the golden noise hypothesis and demonstrates that minimalist RL fine-tuning is practical for diffusion models, highlighting its scope and limitations.

Abstract: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image
diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However,
existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full
sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference
datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden
noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield
superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that
leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a
prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory
storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive
experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently
improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most
significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps
increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present.
These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis
and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion
models.

Abstract: Training large language models typically demands extensive GPU memory and

framework based on block coordinate descent (BCD), augmented with engineering
optimizations, to efficiently train large models on affordable RTX 4090 GPU
clusters. BCD ensures model convergence based on block coordinate descent
theory and performs gradient computation and update at the level of parameter
blocks. Experiments show that 1) Lower cost of Same-Device: BCD significantly
reduces pre-training cost. For the 7B model, under identical hardware settings,
BCD lowers training costs to approximately 33% on A100,A800 clusters on 7B
model averagely and to approximately 2.6% on RTX 4090 clusters on 7B model,
compared to traditional full-parameter training. 2) Cross-Device Transfer: By
leveraging BCD, large-scale models previously trainable only on high-end A100
clusters can be seamlessly migrated and pre-trained on 4090 clusters-whose
hourly cost is only one-quarter that of A100-without requiring expensive
hardware. 3) Accuracy Retention: In both scenarios, BCD training achieves the

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in natural
language processing but face challenges in deployment due to high memory and
computational requirements. Weight quantization is a common approach to address
these issues, yet achieving effective low-bit compression remains challenging.
This paper presents LCD, which unifies the learning of clustering-based

designed optimization techniques, LCD preserves LLM performance even at
ultra-low bit widths of 2-3 bits. Additionally, LCD compresses activations
through smoothing and accelerates inference with a LUT-based design.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Binary quantization represents the most extreme form of large language model
(LLM) compression, reducing weights to $\pm$1 for maximal memory and
computational efficiency. While recent sparsity-aware binarization methods
achieve sub-1-bit compression by pruning redundant binary weights, they suffer
from three critical challenges: performance deterioration, computational
complexity from sparse mask management, and limited hardware compatibility. In
this paper, we present BTC-LLM, a novel sub-1-bit LLM quantization framework
that leverages adaptive weight transformation and binary pattern clustering to
overcome these limitations, delivering both superior accuracy and efficiency.
Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Learnable Transformation
that optimizes invertible scaling and rotation matrices to align binarized
weights with full-precision distributions, enabling incoherence processing to
enhance layer-wise representation quality; (2) a Flash and Accurate Binary
Codebook that identifies recurring binary vector clusters, compressing them
into compact indices with tailored distance metrics and sign-based centroid
updates. This eliminates the need for sparse masks, enabling efficient
inference on standard hardware. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Network pruning, aimed at reducing network size while preserving accuracy,
has attracted significant research interest. Numerous pruning techniques have
been proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more
complex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of
neural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached
a bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we "use a
neural network to prune neural networks". More specifically, we introduce the
newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A
metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a
modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective
mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural
network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning
strategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into
another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained,
our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and
the standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our method achieved
outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including
ResNet56 on CIFAR10, VGG19 on CIFAR100, ResNet50 on ImageNet). Our code is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Several interpretability methods for convolutional network-based classifiers
exist. Most of these methods focus on extracting saliency maps for a given
sample, providing a local explanation that highlights the main regions for the
classification. However, some of these methods lack detailed explanations in
the input space due to upscaling issues or may require random perturbations to
extract the explanations. We propose Convolutional Rectifier for Interpretable
Time Series Classification, or CRITS, as an interpretable model for time series
classification that is designed to intrinsically extract local explanations.
The proposed method uses a layer of convolutional kernels, a max-pooling layer
and a fully-connected rectifier network (a network with only rectified linear
unit activations). The rectified linear unit activation allows the extraction
of the feature weights for the given sample, eliminating the need to calculate
gradients, use random perturbations and the upscale of the saliency maps to the
initial input space. We evaluate CRITS on a set of datasets, and study its
classification performance and its explanation alignment, sensitivity and
understandability.

*Ting-Yun Chang,Muru Zhang,Jesse Thomason,Robin Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies low-bit quantization in LLMs, finding strong correlations in quantization errors between methods and identifying residual stream magnitudes as key indicators of errors. It highlights the importance of late-layer residual activations and MLP gates for maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why low-bit quantization causes significant memory reduction in LLMs but leads to disproportionate errors in certain examples, aiming to identify critical model components for performance preservation.

Method: The paper analyzes various 3-4 bit quantization methods on LLMs of different sizes (7B-70B). It uses statistical analysis to find error correlations, examines residual stream magnitudes, and applies techniques like LLM localization, early exiting, and activation patching to study error amplification and accumulation.

Result: The study found that quantization errors for 50 pairs of methods are strongly correlated (average 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Residual stream magnitudes in full-precision models predict future quantization errors. Examples with large errors depend on precise residual activations in late layers, and MLP gates are crucial for maintaining perplexity.

Conclusion: The work explains why some examples have large quantization errors and identifies the most critical components for preserving model performance under low-bit quantization, suggesting potential avenues for improving quantization techniques.

Abstract: Low-bit weight-only quantization significantly reduces the memory footprint
of large language models (LLMs), but disproportionately affects certain
examples. We analyze diverse 3-4 bit methods on LLMs ranging from 7B-70B in
size and find that the quantization errors of 50 pairs of methods are strongly
correlated (avg. 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Moreover, the residual stream
magnitudes of full-precision models are indicative of future quantization
errors. We further establish a hypothesis that relates the residual stream
magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation over layers. Using LLM
localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, we show that
examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in the late
layers, and that the outputs of MLP gates play a crucial role in maintaining
the perplexity. Our work reveals why certain examples result in large
quantization errors and which model components are most critical for
performance preservation.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of latent environmental fields from sparse and
indirect observations is a foundational challenge across scientific
domains-from atmospheric science and geophysics to public health and aerospace
safety. Traditional approaches rely on physics-based simulators or dense sensor
networks, both constrained by high computational cost, latency, or limited
spatial coverage. We present the Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON), a
spatiotemporal neural operator architecture designed to infer continuous global
scalar fields from sequences of sparse, non-uniform proxy measurements.
  Unlike recent forecasting models that operate on dense, gridded inputs to
predict future states, TRON addresses a more ill-posed inverse problem:
reconstructing the current global field from sparse, temporally evolving sensor
sequences, without access to future observations or dense labels. Demonstrated
on global cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON is trained on 22 years of
simulation data and generalizes across 65,341 spatial locations, 8,400 days,
and sequence lengths from 7 to 90 days. It achieves sub-second inference with
relative L2 errors below 0.1%, representing a >58,000X speedup over Monte
Carlo-based estimators. Though evaluated in the context of cosmic radiation,
TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction
from sparse data, with applications in atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard
monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting.

Abstract: Interpreting large volumes of high-dimensional, unlabeled data in a manner
that is comprehensible to humans remains a significant challenge across various
domains. In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data
can offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct
implications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of
interpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients
recovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of
multimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS
location, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely
collected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately
for each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each
modality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware
prompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster
labels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these
clusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous
statistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected
alongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical
significance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large
language model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the
proposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This
unsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables
clinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve
health outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the trade-offs between generative and discriminative classifiers, previously seen in simpler models, apply to modern transformer-based architectures.

Method: We evaluate various modern architectures (Auto-regressive, Masked Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders) for text classification, analyzing accuracy, sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and ordinality.

Result: The study shows that the traditional 'two regimes' phenomenon is present in different forms across the evaluated architectures and training paradigms.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical advice for choosing between generative and discriminative models based on real-world factors like latency and data availability.

Abstract: The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has
intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression
versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that
generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic
error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the
transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern
generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked
Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification.
Our study reveals that the classical 'two regimes' phenomenon manifests
distinctly across different architectures and training paradigms. Beyond
accuracy, we analyze sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and
ordinality across diverse scenarios. Our findings offer practical guidance for
selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints
such as latency and data limitations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces semantic scheduling for LLM requests, using process semantics to guide priorities and minimize waiting time, with a medical emergency application example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional OS schedulers ignore process semantics, leading to suboptimal prioritization of urgent or important tasks like in medical emergencies. Language models now allow semantic analysis, enabling smarter scheduling.

Method: Proposed a novel scheduling algorithm with optimal time complexity that prioritizes tasks based on their semantic meaning, rather than just latency or fairness metrics.

Result: The algorithm effectively reduces overall waiting time in LLM prompt scheduling, demonstrated through a medical emergency management application showing its benefits for critical tasks.

Conclusion: Semantic scheduling using LLMs can improve prioritization of time-sensitive tasks, offering potential for more context-aware operating systems.

Abstract: Conventional operating system scheduling algorithms are largely
content-ignorant, making decisions based on factors such as latency or fairness
without considering the actual intents or semantics of processes. Consequently,
these algorithms often do not prioritize tasks that require urgent attention or
carry higher importance, such as in emergency management scenarios. However,
recent advances in language models enable semantic analysis of processes,
allowing for more intelligent and context-aware scheduling decisions. In this
paper, we introduce the concept of semantic scheduling in scheduling of
requests from large language models (LLM), where the semantics of the process
guide the scheduling priorities. We present a novel scheduling algorithm with
optimal time complexity, designed to minimize the overall waiting time in
LLM-based prompt scheduling. To illustrate its effectiveness, we present a
medical emergency management application, underscoring the potential benefits
of semantic scheduling for critical, time-sensitive tasks. The code and data

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Self-reflection -- the ability of a large language model (LLM) to revisit,
evaluate, and revise its own reasoning -- has recently emerged as a powerful
behavior enabled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).
While self-reflection correlates with improved reasoning accuracy, its origin
and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, {\it we first
show that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it
already emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent
ability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects
reflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained
models. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from
0.6\% to 18.6\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our
analysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned
models maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from
non-reflective contexts. Leveraging this observation, {\it we then construct a
self-reflection vector, a direction in activation space associated with
self-reflective reasoning}. By manipulating this vector, we enable
bidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and
fine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that
enhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\%, while
suppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to
navigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without
requiring additional training. Our findings further our understanding of
self-reflection and support a growing body of work showing that understanding
model internals can enable precise behavioral control.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that large transformers can be efficiently simulated using multiple small transformers, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in certain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of self-attention in transformers limits their scalability for long input sequences, while small transformers are efficient on short sequences. The motivation is to leverage the efficiency of small transformers for handling long sequences.

Method: The authors theoretically prove that large transformers can be simulated by combining multiple small transformers, analyzing different input scenarios to determine efficiency.

Result: They show that in the worst case, O((N/M)^2) small transformers are needed, but in natural scenarios like average cases, sliding window masking, and attention sinks, O(N/M) suffice.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while worst-case scenarios require more small transformers, practical situations allow for a more efficient linear scaling approach, suggesting potential optimizations for long sequence processing in transformers.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention prevents transformers from scaling
effectively to long input sequences. On the other hand, modern GPUs and other
specialized hardware accelerators are well-optimized for processing small input
sequences in transformers during both training and inference. A natural
question arises: can we take advantage of the efficiency of small transformers
to deal with long input sequences?
  In this paper, we show that transformers with long input sequences (large
transformers) can be efficiently simulated by transformers that can only take
short input sequences (small transformers). Specifically, we prove that any
transformer with input length $N$ can be efficiently simulated by only
$O((N/M)^2)$ transformers with input length $M \ll N$, and that this cannot be
improved in the worst case. However, we then prove that in various natural
scenarios including average-case inputs, sliding window masking and attention
sinks, the optimal number $O(N/M)$ of small transformers suffice.

Abstract: Causal discovery (CD) plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanisms
underlying complex systems. While recent algorithms can detect spurious
associations and latent confounding, many struggle to recover fairness-relevant
pathways in realistic, noisy settings. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their
access to broad semantic knowledge, offer a promising complement to statistical
CD approaches, particularly in domains where metadata provides meaningful
relational cues. Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding
how sensitive attributes causally influence outcomes, yet CD methods often
introduce spurious or biased pathways. We propose a hybrid LLM-based framework
for CD that extends a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy with active learning
and dynamic scoring. Variable pairs are prioritized for LLM-based querying
using a composite score based on mutual information, partial correlation, and
LLM confidence, improving discovery efficiency and robustness.
  To evaluate fairness sensitivity, we construct a semi-synthetic benchmark
from the UCI Adult dataset, embedding a domain-informed causal graph with
injected noise, label corruption, and latent confounding. We assess how well CD
methods recover both global structure and fairness-critical paths.
  Our results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed method,
demonstrate competitive or superior performance in recovering such pathways
under noisy conditions. We highlight when dynamic scoring and active querying
are most beneficial and discuss implications for bias auditing in real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly embedded in critical decision-making
systems, however their foundational ``black-box'' models require eXplainable AI
(XAI) solutions to enhance transparency, which are mostly oriented to experts,
making no sense to non-experts. Alarming evidence about AI's unprecedented
human values risks brings forward the imperative need for transparent
human-centered XAI solutions. In this work, we introduce a domain-, model-,
explanation-agnostic, generalizable and reproducible framework that ensures
both transparency and human-centered explanations tailored to the needs of both
experts and non-experts. The framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)
and employs in-context learning to convey domain- and explainability-relevant
contextual knowledge into LLMs. Through its structured prompt and system
setting, our framework encapsulates in one response explanations understandable
by non-experts and technical information to experts, all grounded in domain and
explainability principles. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
we establish a ground-truth contextual ``thesaurus'' through a rigorous
benchmarking with over 40 data, model, and XAI combinations for an explainable
clustering analysis of a well-being scenario. Through a comprehensive quality
and human-friendliness evaluation of our framework's explanations, we prove
high content quality through strong correlations with ground-truth explanations
(Spearman rank correlation=0.92) and improved interpretability and
human-friendliness to non-experts through a user study (N=56). Our overall
evaluation confirms trust in LLMs as HCXAI enablers, as our framework bridges
the above Gaps by delivering (i) high-quality technical explanations aligned
with foundational XAI methods and (ii) clear, efficient, and interpretable
human-centered explanations for non-experts.

Abstract: The attention operator remains a critical performance bottleneck in large
language models (LLMs), particularly for long-context scenarios. While
FlashAttention is the most widely used and effective GPU-aware acceleration
algorithm, it must require time-consuming and hardware-specific manual
implementation, limiting adaptability across GPU architectures. Existing LLMs
have shown a lot of promise in code generation tasks, but struggle to generate
high-performance attention code. The key challenge is it cannot comprehend the
complex data flow and computation process of the attention operator and utilize
low-level primitive to exploit GPU performance.
  To address the above challenge, we propose an LLM-friendly Thinking Language
(LLM-TL) to help LLMs decouple the generation of high-level optimization logic
and low-level implementation on GPU, and enhance LLMs' understanding of
attention operator. Along with a 2-stage reasoning workflow, TL-Code generation
and translation, the LLMs can automatically generate FlashAttention
implementation on diverse GPUs, establishing a self-optimizing paradigm for
generating high-performance attention operators in attention-centric
algorithms. Verified on A100, RTX8000, and T4 GPUs, the performance of our
methods significantly outshines that of vanilla LLMs, achieving a speed-up of
up to 35.16x. Besides, our method not only surpasses human-optimized libraries
(cuDNN and official library) in most scenarios but also extends support to
unsupported hardware and data types, reducing development time from months to
minutes compared with human experts.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the
effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different
reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT
behavior through the lens of \textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive
psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated
by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation
($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By
decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation
analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance.
Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that
model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how
rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay
between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs
also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and
models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better
prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning
performance. Code is available at

Method: The paper introduces Disruption Masking, which updates weights only when the unlearning and retaining gradients have the same sign, ensuring non-disruptive updates. It also emphasizes gradient normalization and meta-learning.

Result: MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40% in preventing the recovery of dangerous capabilities, establishing a new state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

Conclusion: By combining disruption masking, gradient normalization, and meta-learning, MUDMAN provides a more effective approach to unlearning in language models, reducing risks of misuse and misalignment.

Abstract: Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after
extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent
studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed.
To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components
of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.
  We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating
weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient
are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.
  Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients,
and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights
into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and
validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous
capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40\%, setting a new
state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated a remarkable ability for verbatim
memorization. While numerous works have explored factors influencing model
memorization, the dynamic evolution memorization patterns remains
underexplored. This paper presents a detailed analysis of memorization in the
Pythia model family across varying scales and training steps under prefix
perturbations. Using granular metrics, we examine how model architecture, data
characteristics, and perturbations influence these patterns. Our findings
reveal that: (1) as model scale increases, memorization expands incrementally
while efficiency decreases rapidly; (2) as model scale increases, the rate of
new memorization acquisition decreases while old memorization forgetting
increases; (3) data characteristics (token frequency, repetition count, and
uncertainty) differentially affect memorized versus non-memorized samples; and
(4) prefix perturbations reduce memorization and increase generation
uncertainty proportionally to perturbation strength, with low-redundancy
samples showing higher vulnerability and larger models offering no additional
robustness. These findings advance our understanding of memorization
mechanisms, with direct implications for training optimization, privacy
safeguards, and architectural improvements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data acquisition is costly and time-consuming in biopharmaceuticals, leading to small datasets that hinder ML application.

Method: Comprehensive review and classification of ML methods into a taxonomy, analysis of each method's core concepts, and evaluation of their effectiveness in upstream bioprocessing and related domains.

Result: The review identifies actionable insights, current research gaps, and provides guidance for using ML in data-constrained environments.

Conclusion: This work serves as a guide for practical applications of ML in addressing small data challenges in biopharmaceuticals and similar fields.

Abstract: Data is crucial for machine learning (ML) applications, yet acquiring large
datasets can be costly and time-consuming, especially in complex,
resource-intensive fields like biopharmaceuticals. A key process in this
industry is upstream bioprocessing, where living cells are cultivated and
optimised to produce therapeutic proteins and biologics. The intricate nature
of these processes, combined with high resource demands, often limits data
collection, resulting in smaller datasets. This comprehensive review explores
ML methods designed to address the challenges posed by small data and
classifies them into a taxonomy to guide practical applications. Furthermore,
each method in the taxonomy was thoroughly analysed, with a detailed discussion
of its core concepts and an evaluation of its effectiveness in tackling small
data challenges, as demonstrated by application results in the upstream
bioprocessing and other related domains. By analysing how these methods tackle
small data challenges from different perspectives, this review provides
actionable insights, identifies current research gaps, and offers guidance for
leveraging ML in data-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs is the task of
predicting missing hyperedges involving completely novel entities (i.e., nodes
unseen during training). Existing methods for inductive link prediction with
knowledge hypergraphs assume a fixed relational vocabulary and, as a result,
cannot generalize to knowledge hypergraphs with novel relation types (i.e.,
relations unseen during training). Inspired by knowledge graph foundation
models, we propose HYPER as a foundation model for link prediction, which can
generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and novel
relations. Importantly, HYPER can learn and transfer across different relation
types of varying arities, by encoding the entities of each hyperedge along with
their respective positions in the hyperedge. To evaluate HYPER, we construct 16
new inductive datasets from existing knowledge hypergraphs, covering a diverse
range of relation types of varying arities. Empirically, HYPER consistently
outperforms all existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation
inductive settings, showing strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity
relational structures.

Motivation: To address the limitations of prior work on LLMs for time series analysis, which required heavy fine-tuning and ignored inter-series correlations.

Conclusion: PatchInstruct is effective for time series forecasting without extensive retraining or complex architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated new
possibilities for accurate and efficient time series analysis, but prior work
often required heavy fine-tuning and/or ignored inter-series correlations. In
this work, we explore simple and flexible prompt-based strategies that enable
LLMs to perform time series forecasting without extensive retraining or the use
of a complex external architecture. Through the exploration of specialized
prompting methods that leverage time series decomposition, patch-based
tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, we find that it is
possible to enhance LLM forecasting quality while maintaining simplicity and
requiring minimal preprocessing of data. To this end, we propose our own
method, PatchInstruct, which enables LLMs to make precise and effective
predictions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant
challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and
societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak
attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly
emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class
of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign
prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect
generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic
evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative
advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions,
we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that
efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk
activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we
release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse
real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on
16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable
across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for
enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in
real-world deployments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Electronic Health Record (EHR) data encompass diverse modalities -- text,
images, and medical codes -- that are vital for clinical decision-making. To
process these complex data, multimodal AI (MAI) has emerged as a powerful
approach for fusing such information. However, most existing MAI models
optimize for better prediction performance, potentially reinforcing biases
across patient subgroups. Although bias-reduction techniques for multimodal
models have been proposed, the individual strengths of each modality and their
interplay in both reducing bias and optimizing performance remain
underexplored. In this work, we introduce FAME (Fairness-Aware Multimodal
Embeddings), a framework that explicitly weights each modality according to its
fairness contribution. FAME optimizes both performance and fairness by
incorporating a combined loss function. We leverage the Error Distribution
Disparity Index (EDDI) to measure fairness across subgroups and propose a
sign-agnostic aggregation method to balance fairness across subgroups, ensuring
equitable model outcomes. We evaluate FAME with BEHRT and BioClinicalBERT,
combining structured and unstructured EHR data, and demonstrate its
effectiveness in terms of performance and fairness compared with other
baselines across multiple EHR prediction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crime hotspot prediction is essential for urban safety and law enforcement, but traditional methods like KDE and SVM struggle with capturing complex spatial relationships and geographical interactions.

Method: The authors represent crime data as a graph with nodes as geographic grid cells and edges as proximity relationships, then train a multi-layer GCN model to classify crime types and predict high-risk zones.

Result: The GCN approach achieved 88% classification accuracy, outperforming traditional methods, and generated interpretable heat maps of crime hotspots.

Conclusion: Graph-based learning, specifically GCNs, shows practical utility for predictive policing and spatial criminology by effectively modeling spatial dependencies in crime data.

Abstract: Crime hotspot prediction is critical for ensuring urban safety and effective
law enforcement, yet it remains challenging due to the complex spatial
dependencies inherent in criminal activity. The previous approaches tended to
use classical algorithms such as the KDE and SVM to model data distributions
and decision boundaries. The methods often fail to capture these spatial
relationships, treating crime events as independent and ignoring geographical
interactions. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which explicitly model spatial dependencies by
representing crime data as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent discrete
geographic grid cells and edges capture proximity relationships. Using the
Chicago Crime Dataset, we engineer spatial features and train a multi-layer GCN
model to classify crime types and predict high-risk zones. Our approach
achieves 88% classification accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods. Additionally, the model generates interpretable heat maps of crime
hotspots, demonstrating the practical utility of graph-based learning for
predictive policing and spatial criminology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Clustering of Bandits (CB) methods enhance sequential decision-making by
grouping bandits into clusters based on similarity and incorporating
cluster-level contextual information, demonstrating effectiveness and
adaptability in applications like personalized streaming recommendations.
However, when extending CB algorithms to their neural version (commonly
referred to as Clustering of Neural Bandits, or CNB), they suffer from loss of
plasticity, where neural network parameters become rigid and less adaptable
over time, limiting their ability to adapt to non-stationary environments
(e.g., dynamic user preferences in recommendation). To address this challenge,
we propose Selective Reinitialization (SeRe), a novel bandit learning framework
that dynamically preserves the adaptability of CNB algorithms in evolving
environments. SeRe leverages a contribution utility metric to identify and
selectively reset underutilized units, mitigating loss of plasticity while
maintaining stable knowledge retention. Furthermore, when combining SeRe with
CNB algorithms, the adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the
reinitialization frequency according to the degree of non-stationarity,
ensuring effective adaptation without unnecessary resets. Theoretically, we
prove that SeRe enables sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary
environments, outperforming traditional CNB approaches in long-term
performances. Extensive experiments on six real-world recommendation datasets
demonstrate that SeRe-enhanced CNB algorithms can effectively mitigate the loss
of plasticity with lower regrets, improving adaptability and robustness in
dynamic settings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Conventional low-rank adaptation methods build adapters without considering
data context, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning performance and severe
forgetting of inherent world knowledge. In this paper, we propose
context-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that
initializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop
context-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance
matrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the
target task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its
corresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is
compacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our
method enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM)
and instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between
freezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or
adapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by
deriving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal
components, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank
allocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each
layer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank
allocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a
significant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning
performance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained
knowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM,
our method exhibits faster convergence, \emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA,
and improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong
baseline methods. Our method has been integrated into the PEFT library
developed by Hugging Face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of self-attention in large-scale physical systems due to its quadratic scaling and the inapplicability of existing sparse attention mechanisms for irregular geometries.

Method: BSA adapts Native Sparse Attention (NSA) by using Ball Trees to impose regularity on unordered point sets, modifying NSA's components to work with ball-based neighborhoods.

Result: BSA achieves accuracy comparable to Full Attention on an airflow pressure prediction task while significantly reducing computational complexity.

Conclusion: BSA provides an efficient alternative to self-attention for irregular geometries, enabling broader application in large-scale physical systems.

Abstract: Self-attention scales quadratically with input size, limiting its use for
large-scale physical systems. Although sparse attention mechanisms provide a
viable alternative, they are primarily designed for regular structures such as
text or images, making them inapplicable for irregular geometries. In this
work, we present Ball Sparse Attention (BSA), which adapts Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) (Yuan et al., 2025) to unordered point sets by imposing
regularity using the Ball Tree structure from the Erwin Transformer (Zhdanov et
al., 2025). We modify NSA's components to work with ball-based neighborhoods,
yielding a global receptive field at sub-quadratic cost. On an airflow pressure
prediction task, we achieve accuracy comparable to Full Attention while
significantly reducing the theoretical computational complexity. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/britacatalin/bsa.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow
domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a
phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends
from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on
malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable
CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly
misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for
tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these
misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick
the user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five
sleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors
that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.
  Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad
behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes
broad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find
that reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers,
demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these
behaviors but is unreliable.
  In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned
intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We
release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent
misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation
suite.

Abstract: Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced ECG arrhythmia
classification, enabling high accuracy in detecting various cardiac conditions.
The use of single-lead ECG systems is crucial for portable devices, as they
offer convenience and accessibility for continuous monitoring in diverse
settings. However, the interpretability and reliability of deep learning models
in clinical applications poses challenges due to their black-box nature.
Methods: To address these challenges, we propose EXGnet, a single-lead,
trustworthy ECG arrhythmia classification network that integrates
multiresolution feature extraction with Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) guidance and train only quantitative features. Results: Trained on two
public datasets, including Chapman and Ningbo, EXGnet demonstrates superior
performance through key metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, Sensitivity, and
Specificity. The proposed method achieved average five fold accuracy of
98.762%, and 96.932% and average F1-score of 97.910%, and 95.527% on the
Chapman and Ningbo datasets, respectively. Conclusions: By employing XAI
techniques, specifically Grad-CAM, the model provides visual insights into the
relevant ECG segments it analyzes, thereby enhancing clinician trust in its
predictions. While quantitative features further improve classification
performance, they are not required during testing, making the model suitable
for real-world applications. Overall, EXGnet not only achieves better
classification accuracy but also addresses the critical need for
interpretability in deep learning, facilitating broader adoption in portable
ECG monitoring.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact
"student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger
"teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de
facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically
this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a
correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in
every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must
be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and
recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting
teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation
(PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers
knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its
own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the
true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher
confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes
weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification
benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST
(arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous
settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in
heterogeneous settings.

TL;DR: This paper explores how using a compositional subtask curriculum during in-context learning affects how transformers learn and perform tasks, showing that such a curriculum allows for better zero-shot inference and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how the structure of in-context learning, specifically the use of a compositional subtask curriculum, influences the computations of transformer models.

Method: The method involves creating a compositional algorithmic task (modular exponential, which is a double exponential task made of two single exponential subtasks) and training transformer models in two different ways: (a) with a curriculum of single exponential subtasks, and (b) directly on the double exponential task without the curriculum.

Result: Models trained with a subtask curriculum can perform zero-shot inference on new compositional tasks and are more robust when given the same context length.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the specific design of the curriculum during in-context learning influences the strategies that transformer models use, leading to improved performance on compositional tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) research often considers learning a function
in-context through a uniform sample of input-output pairs. Here, we investigate
how presenting a compositional subtask curriculum in context may alter the
computations a transformer learns. We design a compositional algorithmic task
based on the modular exponential-a double exponential task composed of two
single exponential subtasks and train transformer models to learn the task
in-context. We compare (a) models trained using an in-context curriculum
consisting of single exponential subtasks and, (b) models trained directly on
the double exponential task without such a curriculum. We show that models
trained with a subtask curriculum can perform zero-shot inference on unseen
compositional tasks and are more robust given the same context length. We study
how the task and subtasks are represented across the two training regimes. We
find that the models employ diverse strategies modulated by the specific
curriculum design.

Abstract: Learning rate is widely regarded as crucial for effective foundation model
pretraining. Recent research explores and demonstrates the transferability of
learning rate configurations across varying model and dataset sizes, etc.
Nevertheless, these approaches are constrained to specific training scenarios
and typically necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning on proxy models. In
this work, we propose \textbf{AdaLRS}, a plug-in-and-play adaptive learning
rate search algorithm that conducts online optimal learning rate search via
optimizing loss descent velocities. We provide experiment results to show that
the optimization of training loss and loss descent velocity in foundation model
pretraining are both convex and share the same optimal learning rate. Relying
solely on training loss dynamics, AdaLRS involves few extra computations to
guide the search process, and its convergence is guaranteed via theoretical
analysis. Experiments on both LLM and VLM pretraining show that AdaLRS adjusts
suboptimal learning rates to the neighborhood of optimum with marked efficiency
and effectiveness, with model performance improved accordingly. We also show
the robust generalizability of AdaLRS across varying training scenarios, such
as different model sizes, training paradigms, and base learning rate scheduler
choices.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Since self-attention layers in Transformers are permutation invariant by
design, positional encodings must be explicitly incorporated to enable spatial
understanding. However, fixed-size lookup tables used in traditional learnable
position embeddings (PEs) limit extrapolation capabilities beyond pre-trained
sequence lengths. Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this
limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities,
underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this
work, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding
framework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic
sequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their
embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we
introduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns
embedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a
knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position
embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing
extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context
question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only
surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and
accuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables
seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual
architectural redesign. We release our code, data, and checkpoints at

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) involves predicting future values
of multiple interrelated time series. Recently, deep learning-based MTSF models
have gained significant attention for their promising ability to mine semantics
(global and local information) within MTS data. However, these models are
pervasively susceptible to missing values caused by malfunctioning data
collectors. These missing values not only disrupt the semantics of MTS, but
their distribution also changes over time. Nevertheless, existing models lack
robustness to such issues, leading to suboptimal forecasting performance. To
this end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning
(Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between
incomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations
in MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge
distillation and multi-view contrastive learning. The former utilizes a teacher
model to guide a student model in mining semantics from incomplete
observations, similar to those obtainable from complete observations. The
latter improves the student model's robustness by learning from
positive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with
different missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing
rates. Therefore, Merlin is capable of effectively enhancing the robustness of
existing models against unfixed missing rates while preserving forecasting
accuracy. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority
of Merlin.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer

flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to
ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete
\textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling),
the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly
denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level
Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token
ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled
segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is
orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with
various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling
benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms
naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with
state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements
in training efficiency and flexibility.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
node classification tasks but struggle with label noise in real-world data.
Existing studies on graph learning with label noise commonly rely on
class-dependent label noise, overlooking the complexities of instance-dependent
noise and falling short of capturing real-world corruption patterns. We
introduce BeGIN (Benchmarking for Graphs with Instance-dependent Noise), a new
benchmark that provides realistic graph datasets with various noise types and
comprehensively evaluates noise-handling strategies across GNN architectures,
noisy label detection, and noise-robust learning. To simulate
instance-dependent corruptions, BeGIN introduces algorithmic methods and
LLM-based simulations. Our experiments reveal the challenges of
instance-dependent noise, particularly LLM-based corruption, and underscore the
importance of node-specific parameterization to enhance GNN robustness. By
comprehensively evaluating noise-handling strategies, BeGIN provides insights
into their effectiveness, efficiency, and key performance factors. We expect
that BeGIN will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research on label
noise in graphs and fostering the development of robust GNN training methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to
comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level
performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally
constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting
to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on
previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous
approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of
generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a
comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative
models, including large language models, multimodal large language models,
vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from
the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these
approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and
replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and
motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different
generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core
backbones, offering deeper insights into the field. The project page of this

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to many contemporary AI
applications, yet their extensive parameter counts pose significant challenges
for deployment in memory- and compute-constrained environments. Recent works in
eXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that
interpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing
components irrelevant to inference. In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise
Relevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs.
While LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend
it to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially
reduce model size with minimal performance loss. Our method is especially
effective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' --
which can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification).
Building on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively
removing circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). All
in all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase
its effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for
compression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models,
highlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety. Our

Motivation: Accurate driving behavior modeling is crucial for safe and efficient trajectory prediction, but it's difficult in complex traffic situations. Existing methods struggle with adaptability across different scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes an IRL framework that infers diverse reward functions to mimic human decision-making. It uses an encoder-decoder architecture with Mamba blocks for long-sequence dependencies and graph attention networks to model spatial interactions between traffic agents.

Result: The proposed method shows higher prediction accuracy than existing approaches and achieves twice the generalization performance in unseen scenarios compared to other IRL-based methods.

Conclusion: The novel IRL framework effectively models human-like driving behavior, offering improved adaptability and performance in complex traffic environments.

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior modeling is fundamental to safe and efficient
trajectory prediction, yet remains challenging in complex traffic scenarios.
This paper presents a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that
captures human-like decision-making by inferring diverse reward functions,
enabling robust cross-scenario adaptability. The learned reward function is
utilized to maximize the likelihood of output by the encoder-decoder
architecture that combines Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence dependency
modeling with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among
traffic agents. Comprehensive evaluations on urban intersections and
roundabouts demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms various
popular approaches in prediction accuracy but also achieves 2 times higher
generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other IRL-based

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) rely heavily on high-quality open-source datasets
(e.g., ImageNet) for their success, making dataset ownership verification (DOV)
crucial for protecting public dataset copyrights. In this paper, we find
existing DOV methods (implicitly) assume that the verification process is
faithful, where the suspicious model will directly verify ownership by using
the verification samples as input and returning their results. However, this
assumption may not necessarily hold in practice and their performance may
degrade sharply when subjected to intentional or unintentional perturbations.
To address this limitation, we propose the first certified dataset watermark
(i.e., CertDW) and CertDW-based certified dataset ownership verification method
that ensures reliable verification even under malicious attacks, under certain
conditions (e.g., constrained pixel-level perturbation). Specifically, inspired
by conformal prediction, we introduce two statistical measures, including
principal probability (PP) and watermark robustness (WR), to assess model
prediction stability on benign and watermarked samples under noise
perturbations. We prove there exists a provable lower bound between PP and WR,
enabling ownership verification when a suspicious model's WR value
significantly exceeds the PP values of multiple benign models trained on
watermark-free datasets. If the number of PP values smaller than WR exceeds a
threshold, the suspicious model is regarded as having been trained on the
protected dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the
effectiveness of our CertDW method and its resistance to potential adaptive
attacks. Our codes are at

TL;DR: SARA is a new PbRL method that is robust to noisy labels and works with different feedback types and training setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most PbRL methods aren't robust to labeler errors and are too specific.

Method: SARA uses a contrastive framework to learn a latent space of preferred samples and computes rewards based on similarity.

Result: SARA performs well on offline RL benchmarks and is versatile for tasks like trajectory filtering and cross-task transfer.

Conclusion: SARA is a flexible and robust PbRL approach that can handle various feedback formats and is effective in different settings.

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) entails a variety of
approaches for aligning models with human intent to alleviate the burden of
reward engineering. However, most previous PbRL work has not investigated the
robustness to labeler errors, inevitable with labelers who are non-experts or
operate under time constraints. Additionally, PbRL algorithms often target very
specific settings (e.g. pairwise ranked preferences or purely offline
learning). We introduce Similarity as Reward Alignment (SARA), a simple
contrastive framework that is both resilient to noisy labels and adaptable to
diverse feedback formats and training paradigms. SARA learns a latent
representation of preferred samples and computes rewards as similarities to the
learned latent. We demonstrate strong performance compared to baselines on
continuous control offline RL benchmarks. We further demonstrate SARA's
versatility in applications such as trajectory filtering for downstream tasks,
cross-task preference transfer, and reward shaping in online learning.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the underemphasis on defining fairness measures and to incorporate societal factors into ML fairness research.

Method: The method involves arguing for the importance of fairness measures and societal integration through analysis of current ML practices and biases.

Result: The result is a call for more attention to fairness definitions and societal context in ML systems.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that enhancing fairness requires better-defined measures and consideration of societal influences.

Abstract: Enhancing fairness in machine learning (ML) systems is increasingly important
nowadays. While current research focuses on assistant tools for ML pipelines to
promote fairness within them, we argue that: 1) The significance of properly
defined fairness measures remains underestimated; and 2) Fairness research in
ML should integrate societal considerations. The reasons include that detecting
discrimination is critical due to the widespread deployment of ML systems and
that human-AI feedback loops amplify biases, even when only small social and
political biases persist.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a single, flexible generative framework that unifies existing methods for solving PDEs, which currently require specialized strategies for different tasks and observation scenarios.

Method: The method involves recasting PDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem and designing a transformer-based architecture that conditions on arbitrary known data patterns to infer missing values in space and time, using pixel-space video diffusion models with hierarchical modeling for efficiency.

Result: The results show that the video inpainting-based diffusion model provides an accurate and versatile solution across various PDEs and problem setups, outperforming existing state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that their approach offers a promising and efficient method for solving PDEs by unifying forward and inverse problem-solving under a single framework.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) using video-inpainting diffusion transformer models. Unlike existing
methods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse
problems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks
under a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast
PDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward
prediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states
from initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based
architecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer
missing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video
diffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning,
while enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling.
Extensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model
offers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and
problem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success, yet its
application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by a lack of robustness
to environmental uncertainties. To solve this challenge, some robust RL
algorithms have been proposed, but most are limited to tabular settings. In
this work, we propose Distributionally Robust Soft Actor-Critic (DR-SAC), a
novel algorithm designed to enhance the robustness of the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. DR-SAC aims to maximize the expected value with
entropy against the worst possible transition model lying in an uncertainty
set. A distributionally robust version of the soft policy iteration is derived
with a convergence guarantee. For settings where nominal distributions are
unknown, such as offline RL, a generative modeling approach is proposed to
estimate the required nominal distributions from data. Furthermore,
experimental results on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks
demonstrate our algorithm achieves up to $9.8$ times the average reward of the
SAC baseline under common perturbations. Additionally, compared with existing
robust reinforcement learning algorithms, DR-SAC significantly improves
computing efficiency and applicability to large-scale problems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes estimating the optimal loss in diffusion models to improve training and understand scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models' loss isn't zero at optimal, causing confusion between high loss and low capacity.

Method: Derived optimal loss in closed form, created estimators with variance/bias control, used large models to test power law.

Result: Optimal loss estimation allows better training schedules and clearer scaling law analysis.

Conclusion: Estimating optimal loss is crucial for diagnosing and improving diffusion models, offering a principled approach to scaling laws.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.
Despite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of
absolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero
but unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient
model capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss
value for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the
optimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models,
and develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant
scalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this
tool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of
mainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training
schedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B
parameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting
the optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled
setting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sim-to-real gap in RL, which hinders practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Method: A latent space-based approach for analyzing and improving policies in model-based settings.

Result: The method effectively measures and mitigates the sim-to-real gap in MuJoCo experiments.

Conclusion: While the approach shows promise, challenges in sim-to-real transfer persist, especially for model-based methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is playing an increasingly important role in
fields such as robotic control and autonomous driving. However, the gap between
simulation and the real environment remains a major obstacle to the practical
deployment of RL. Agents trained in simulators often struggle to maintain
performance when transferred to real-world physical environments. In this
paper, we propose a latent space based approach to analyze the impact of
simulation on real-world policy improvement in model-based settings. As a
natural extension of model-based methods, our approach enables an intuitive
observation of the challenges faced by model-based methods in sim-to-real
transfer. Experiments conducted in the MuJoCo environment evaluate the
performance of our method in both measuring and mitigating the sim-to-real gap.
The experiments also highlight the various challenges that remain in overcoming
the sim-to-real gap, especially for model-based methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) accelerates training by eliminating the
need to wait for stragglers, but its asynchronous nature introduces gradient
staleness, where outdated gradients degrade performance. Existing solutions
address this issue with gradient buffers, forming a semi-asynchronous
framework. However, this approach struggles when buffers accumulate numerous
stale gradients, as blindly aggregating all gradients can harm training. To
address this, we propose AFBS (Asynchronous FL Buffer Selection), the first
algorithm to perform gradient selection within buffers while ensuring privacy
protection. Specifically, the client sends the random projection encrypted
label distribution matrix before training, and the server performs client
clustering based on it. During training, server scores and selects gradients
within each cluster based on their informational value, discarding low-value
gradients to enhance semi-asynchronous federated learning. Extensive
experiments in highly heterogeneous system and data environments demonstrate
AFBS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on
the most challenging task, CIFAR-100, AFBS improves accuracy by up to 4.8% over
the previous best algorithm and reduces the time to reach target accuracy by
75%.

Abstract: We present \textbf{FlowRL}, a novel framework for online reinforcement
learning that integrates flow-based policy representation with
Wasserstein-2-regularized optimization. We argue that in addition to training
signals, enhancing the expressiveness of the policy class is crucial for the
performance gains in RL. Flow-based generative models offer such potential,
excelling at capturing complex, multimodal action distributions. However, their
direct application in online RL is challenging due to a fundamental objective
mismatch: standard flow training optimizes for static data imitation, while RL
requires value-based policy optimization through a dynamic buffer, leading to
difficult optimization landscapes. FlowRL first models policies via a
state-dependent velocity field, generating actions through deterministic ODE
integration from noise. We derive a constrained policy search objective that
jointly maximizes Q through the flow policy while bounding the Wasserstein-2
distance to a behavior-optimal policy implicitly derived from the replay
buffer. This formulation effectively aligns the flow optimization with the RL
objective, enabling efficient and value-aware policy learning despite the
complexity of the policy class. Empirical evaluations on DMControl and
Humanoidbench demonstrate that FlowRL achieves competitive performance in
online reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has traditionally solved black box problems where
evaluation is expensive and, therefore, design-evaluation pairs (i.e.,
observations) are few. Recently, there has been growing interest in applying BO
to problems where evaluation is cheaper and, thus, observations are more
plentiful. An impediment to scaling BO to many observations, $N$, is the
$O(N^3)$ scaling of a na{\"i}ve query of the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate.
Modern implementations reduce this to $O(N^2)$, but the GP remains a
bottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a surrogate that
estimates function values and epistemic uncertainty from $K$ nearest-neighbor
observations. ENN has $O(N)$ query time and omits hyperparameter fitting,
leaving uncertainty uncalibrated. To accommodate the lack of calibration, we
employ an acquisition method based on Pareto-optimal tradeoffs between
predicted value and uncertainty. Our proposed method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the
GP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson sampling acquisition method
with our Pareto-based alternative. We demonstrate numerically that TuRBO-ENN
can reduce the time to generate proposals by one to two orders of magnitude
compared to TuRBO and scales to thousands of observations.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the logit dynamics of softmax policy gradient methods and derives an exact formula for the L2 norm of the logit update vector, showing that update magnitudes depend on the chosen action's probability and the policy's collision probability, which is inversely related to entropy. The analysis reveals a self-regulation mechanism that modulates learning vigor based on policy confidence, offering insights into stability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stability and convergence of softmax policy gradient methods, which are widely used in reinforcement learning but lack a clear theoretical foundation for their dynamics.

Method: The authors analyze the logit dynamics of softmax policy gradient methods, deriving an exact formula for the L2 norm of the logit update vector. They examine how update magnitudes are influenced by the chosen action's probability and the policy's collision probability, a measure of concentration inversely related to entropy.

Result: The derived formula shows that the L2 norm of the logit update vector is proportional to the square root of (1 - 2P_c + C(P)), indicating that update magnitudes are determined by P_c and C(P). The analysis reveals a self-regulation mechanism where learning vigor is modulated by policy confidence.

Conclusion: The paper provides a foundational insight into the stability and convergence of softmax policy gradient methods through the discovery of an inherent self-regulation mechanism based on policy confidence, which helps explain their effectiveness in practice.

Abstract: We analyzes the logit dynamics of softmax policy gradient methods. We derive
the exact formula for the L2 norm of the logit update vector: $$ \|\Delta
\mathbf{z}\|_2 \propto \sqrt{1-2P_c + C(P)} $$ This equation demonstrates that
update magnitudes are determined by the chosen action's probability ($P_c$) and
the policy's collision probability ($C(P)$), a measure of concentration
inversely related to entropy. Our analysis reveals an inherent self-regulation
mechanism where learning vigor is automatically modulated by policy confidence,
providing a foundational insight into the stability and convergence of these
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional training data attribution algorithms fail to account for randomness in model training due to stochastic initialization and batching, leading to different models even with the same dataset.

Method: Introduce distributional training data attribution (d-TDA) to predict the distribution of model outputs over training runs and show that influence functions emerge naturally from this framework via unrolled differentiation.

Result: d-TDA can identify training examples that significantly affect the distribution of target measurements without changing the mean, and influence functions are shown to be a limit of this framework without restrictive convexity assumptions.

Conclusion: d-TDA addresses the shortcomings of traditional methods by incorporating distributional analysis, offering new insights into the efficacy and limitations of influence functions in deep learning.

Abstract: Randomness is an unavoidable part of training deep learning models, yet
something that traditional training data attribution algorithms fail to
rigorously account for. They ignore the fact that, due to stochasticity in the
initialisation and batching, training on the same dataset can yield different
models. In this paper, we address this shortcoming through introducing
distributional training data attribution (d-TDA), the goal of which is to
predict how the distribution of model outputs (over training runs) depends upon
the dataset. We demonstrate the practical significance of d-TDA in experiments,
e.g. by identifying training examples that drastically change the distribution
of some target measurement without necessarily changing the mean. Intriguingly,
we also find that influence functions (IFs), a popular but poorly-understood
data attribution tool, emerge naturally from our distributional framework as
the limit to unrolled differentiation; without requiring restrictive convexity
assumptions. This provides a new mathematical motivation for their efficacy in
deep learning, and helps to characterise their limitations.

ensures comprehensive geometric representation across datapoints. This
framework enables the effective aggregation of knowledge from diverse sources,
thereby improving performance on target tasks. We evaluate our model on 23

performance gains over existing benchmark model under both random (14.4%) and

Conclusion: Symmetries in parameter space are significant for understanding deep learning and offer new avenues for research.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models are highly overparameterized, resulting in large

symmetries shape the loss landscape and constrain learning dynamics, offering a
new lens for understanding optimization, generalization, and model complexity
that complements existing theory of deep learning. This survey provides an
overview of parameter space symmetry. We summarize existing literature, uncover
connections between symmetry and learning theory, and identify gaps and

condensation (DGC), which aims to substantially reduce the scale of dynamic
graphs for data-efficient DGNN training. Accordingly, we propose DyGC, a novel
framework that condenses the real dynamic graph into a compact version while
faithfully preserving the inherent spatiotemporal characteristics.
Specifically, to endow synthetic graphs with realistic evolving structures, a
novel spiking structure generation mechanism is introduced. It draws on the
dynamic behavior of spiking neurons to model temporally-aware connectivity in
dynamic graphs. Given the tightly coupled spatiotemporal dependencies, DyGC
proposes a tailored distribution matching approach that first constructs a
semantically rich state evolving field for dynamic graphs, and then performs
fine-grained spatiotemporal state alignment to guide the optimization of the
condensed graph. Experiments across multiple dynamic graph datasets and
representative DGNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of DyGC.
Notably, our method retains up to 96.2% DGNN performance with only 0.5% of the
original graph size, and achieves up to 1846 times training speedup.

Abstract: One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its
limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by
uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural
networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after
prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper
proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that
integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent
the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize
learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the
kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under
distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new
behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d
benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under
distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement
in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under
normal conditions.

Abstract: Identifying causative genes from patient phenotypes remains a significant
challenge in precision medicine, with important implications for the diagnosis
and treatment of genetic disorders. We propose a novel graph-based approach for
predicting causative genes from patient phenotypes, with or without an
available list of candidate genes, by integrating a rare disease knowledge
graph (KG). Our model, combining graph neural networks and transformers,
achieves substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art. On the
real-world MyGene2 dataset, it attains a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 24.64\%
and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR
and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the
contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to
cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in
clinical decision support when genomic information is incomplete.

Abstract: We study online decision making problems under resource constraints, where
both reward and cost functions are drawn from distributions that may change
adversarially over time. We focus on two canonical settings: $(i)$ online
resource allocation where rewards and costs are observed before action
selection, and $(ii)$ online learning with resource constraints where they are
observed after action selection, under full feedback or bandit feedback. It is
well known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when
reward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this
challenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending
plan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design
general (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to
baselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our
algorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution
of the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our
methods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly
imbalanced. To conclude, we study the regret of our algorithms when competing
against benchmarks that deviate from the prescribed spending plan.

Abstract: Vine copulas are sophisticated models for multivariate distributions and are
increasingly used in machine learning. To facilitate their integration into
modern ML pipelines, we introduce the vine computational graph, a DAG that
abstracts the multilevel vine structure and associated computations. On this
foundation, we devise new algorithms for conditional sampling, efficient
sampling-order scheduling, and constructing vine structures for customized
conditioning variables. We implement these ideas in torchvinecopulib, a
GPU-accelerated Python library built upon PyTorch, delivering improved
scalability for fitting, sampling, and density evaluation. Our experiments
illustrate how gradient flowing through the vine can improve Vine Copula
Autoencoders and that incorporating vines for uncertainty quantification in
deep learning can outperform MC-dropout, deep ensembles, and Bayesian Neural
Networks in sharpness, calibration, and runtime. By recasting vine copula
models as computational graphs, our work connects classical dependence modeling
with modern deep-learning toolchains and facilitates the integration of
state-of-the-art copula methods in modern machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is
challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological
variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique
characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks.
We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model
for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates
graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a
novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our
contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs)
to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we
develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and
generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique
spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness
against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq
datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity
and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets
a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust
tool for various downstream biological applications.

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate the strengths of multiple fine-tuned models
into a unified model while preserving task-specific capabilities. Existing
methods, represented by task arithmetic, are typically classified into global-
and local-aware methods. However, global-aware methods inevitably cause
parameter interference, while local-aware methods struggle to maintain the
effectiveness of task-specific details in the merged model. To address these
limitations, we propose a Consensus-Aware Localized Merging (CALM) method which
incorporates localized information aligned with global task consensus, ensuring
its effectiveness post-merging. CALM consists of three key components: (1)
class-balanced entropy minimization sampling, providing a more flexible and
reliable way to leverage unsupervised data; (2) an efficient-aware framework,
selecting a small set of tasks for sequential merging with high scalability;
(3) a consensus-aware mask optimization, aligning localized binary masks with
global task consensus and merging them conflict-free. Experiments demonstrate
the superiority and robustness of our CALM, significantly outperforming
existing methods and achieving performance close to traditional MTL.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have demonstrated success across a wide
range of 3D modelling tasks. A fundamental operation in these networks is the
tensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner
to create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor
product, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this
operation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor
product (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a
careful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In
particular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the
same operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of
expressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to
characterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original
implementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical
grid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster
on our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by
30\%. Finally, we provide the first systematic microbenchmarks of the various
tensor product operations. We find that the theoretical runtime guarantees can
differ wildly from empirical performance, demonstrating the need for careful
application-specific benchmarking. Code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Seismic acoustic impedance plays a crucial role in lithological
identification and subsurface structure interpretation. However, due to the
inherently ill-posed nature of the inversion problem, directly estimating
impedance from post-stack seismic data remains highly challenging. Recently,
diffusion models have shown great potential in addressing such inverse problems
due to their strong prior learning and generative capabilities. Nevertheless,
most existing methods operate in the pixel domain and require multiple
iterations, limiting their applicability to field data. To alleviate these
limitations, we propose a novel seismic acoustic impedance inversion framework
based on a conditional latent generative diffusion model, where the inversion
process is made in latent space. To avoid introducing additional training
overhead when embedding conditional inputs, we design a lightweight
wavelet-based module into the framework to project seismic data and reuse an
encoder trained on impedance to embed low-frequency impedance into the latent
space. Furthermore, we propose a model-driven sampling strategy during the
inversion process of this framework to enhance accuracy and reduce the number
of required diffusion steps. Numerical experiments on a synthetic model
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high inversion accuracy and
strong generalization capability within only a few diffusion steps. Moreover,
application to field data reveals enhanced geological detail and higher
consistency with well-log measurements, validating the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) focuses on optimizing
makespan under deterministic constraints. Real-world production environments
introduce additional complexities that cause traditional scheduling approaches
to be less effective. Reinforcement learning (RL) holds potential in addressing
these challenges, as it allows agents to learn adaptive scheduling strategies.
However, there is a lack of a comprehensive, general-purpose frameworks for
effectively training and evaluating RL agents under real-world constraints. To
address this gap, we propose a modular framework that extends classical JSSP
formulations by incorporating key \mbox{real-world} constraints inherent to the
shopfloor, including transport logistics, buffer management, machine
breakdowns, setup times, and stochastic processing conditions, while also
supporting multi-objective optimization. The framework is a customizable
solution that offers flexibility in defining problem instances and configuring
simulation parameters, enabling adaptation to diverse production scenarios. A
standardized interface ensures compatibility with various RL approaches,
providing a robust environment for training RL agents and facilitating the
standardized comparison of different scheduling methods under dynamic and
uncertain conditions. We release JobShopLab as an open-source tool for both
research and industrial applications, accessible at:

Abstract: Synthetic data generation plays a crucial role in medical research by
mitigating privacy concerns and enabling large-scale patient data analysis.
This study presents a beta-Variational Autoencoder Graph Convolutional Neural
Network framework for generating synthetic Abdominal Aorta Aneurysms (AAA).
Using a small real-world dataset, our approach extracts key anatomical features
and captures complex statistical relationships within a compact disentangled
latent space. To address data limitations, low-impact data augmentation based
on Procrustes analysis was employed, preserving anatomical integrity. The
generation strategies, both deterministic and stochastic, manage to enhance
data diversity while ensuring realism. Compared to PCA-based approaches, our
model performs more robustly on unseen data by capturing complex, nonlinear
anatomical variations. This enables more comprehensive clinical and statistical
analyses than the original dataset alone. The resulting synthetic AAA dataset
preserves patient privacy while providing a scalable foundation for medical
research, device testing, and computational modeling.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has entered in a
experience-driven era, flagged by the emergence of environment feedback-driven
learning via reinforcement learning and tool-using agents. This encourages the
emergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how
should a LLM interact with external services, such as \api and data. However,
as MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces
new safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are
not controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party
MCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic
incentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In
this position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay
close attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop
new techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our
position, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \framework, a
controlled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2)
We then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks
in MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial.
(3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered
agent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the
following research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP
safety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP
safe ecosystem construction. We hope this position paper can raise the
awareness of the research community in MCP safety and encourage more
researchers to join this important research direction. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: One proposed mechanism to improve exploration in reinforcement learning is
through the use of macro-actions. Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the
naive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather
the opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful
macros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively
environment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different
perspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between
reducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size
of the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action
as independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and
making typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we
propose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between
actions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by
reducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving
exploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned
jointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy
looking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment.
Our results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all
environments. Additionally, we show that the macro-action similarity is
transferable to related environments. We believe this work is a small but
important step towards understanding how the similarity-imposed geometry on the
action space can be exploited to improve credit assignment and exploration,
therefore making learning more effective.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Single-trajectory reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to optimize
policies from datasets consisting of (prompt, response, reward) triplets, where
scalar rewards are directly available. This supervision format is highly
practical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down
signals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In
contrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which
are harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory
approaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical
performance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires
approximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high
off-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of
absolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning
Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing
the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards
using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a
straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary
models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on
the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO
on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder
models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory
baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings
confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for
single-trajectory policy optimization.

Abstract: Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large

semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster,
a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to
perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized
time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured
output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is
optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence,
prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using
a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish
a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at
the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in
time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across
six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series
models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain,
respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it
also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware
explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that
reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating
temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.

Abstract: Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been
widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal
responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures
known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved
by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem.
We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a
self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold
packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential
energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in
the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each
class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single
image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized
by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable
dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces
geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the
standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only
a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with
state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are
effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the
potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine
learning.

Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language
Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs).
Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token,
parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based
generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation,
fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception.
These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models.
Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as
a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance
comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x
acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven
by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs
and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and
foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing
domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete
diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and
dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM
and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs,
formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative
models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and
summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and
biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Tariff exemptions are fundamental to attracting Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) into the manufacturing sector, though the associated administrative
processes present areas for optimization for both investing entities and the
national tax authority. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to empower
tax administration by leveraging a synergistic integration of Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies. The proposed
system is designed to first utilize OCR for intelligent digitization, precisely
extracting data from diverse application documents and key regulatory texts
such as tariff orders. Subsequently, the LLM would enhance the capabilities of
administrative officers by automating the critical and time-intensive task of
verifying submitted HS Tariff Codes for machinery, equipment, and raw materials
against official exemption lists. By enhancing the speed and precision of these
initial assessments, this AI-driven approach systematically reduces potential
for non-alignment and non-optimized exemption utilization, thereby streamlining
the investment journey for FDI companies. For the national administration, the
benefits include a significant boost in operational capacity, reduced
administrative load, and a strengthened control environment, ultimately
improving the ease of doing business and solidifying the nation's appeal as a
premier destination for high-value manufacturing FDI.

historically dehumanized by scientific research. Autistic people in particular
have been dehumanized by being compared to robots, making it even more
important to ensure this marginalization is not reproduced by AI that may
promote neuronormative social behaviors. Second, the ubiquitous use of these
agents raises concerns surrounding model biases and accessibility. In our work,
we investigate the experiences of the people who build and design these
technologies to gain insights into their understanding and acceptance of
neurodivergence, and the challenges in making their work more accessible to
users with diverse needs. Even though neurodivergent individuals are often
marginalized for their unique communication styles, nearly all participants
overlooked the conclusions their end-users and other AI system makers may draw
about communication norms from the implementation and interpretation of
humanness applied in participants' work. This highlights a major gap in their
broader ethical considerations, compounded by some participants' neuronormative
assumptions about the behaviors and traits that distinguish "humans" from
"bots" and the replication of these assumptions in their work. We examine the
impact this may have on autism inclusion in society and provide recommendations
for additional systemic changes towards more ethical research directions.

Motivation: To enhance traditional credit evaluation by incorporating social media data and ensuring compliance with Islamic ethics.

Method: Uses a conversational banking assistant to collect consent and data, multimodal feature extractors for behavioral analysis, and a retrieval-augmented generation module with an LLM for explainable decisions.

Result: Demonstrates how social signals influence credit-score factors through synthetic scenarios and presents the system's architecture and models.

Conclusion: Highlights the conceptual innovation, compliance features, and practical implications for various stakeholders in finance and ethics.

Abstract: SocialCredit+ is AI powered credit scoring system that leverages publicly
available social media data to augment traditional credit evaluation. It uses a
conversational banking assistant to gather user consent and fetch public
profiles. Multimodal feature extractors analyze posts, bios, images, and friend
networks to generate a rich behavioral profile. A specialized Sharia-compliance
layer flags any non-halal indicators and prohibited financial behavior based on
Islamic ethics. The platform employs a retrieval-augmented generation module:
an LLM accesses a domain specific knowledge base to generate clear, text-based
explanations for each decision. We describe the end-to-end architecture and
data flow, the models used, and system infrastructure. Synthetic scenarios
illustrate how social signals translate into credit-score factors. This paper
emphasizes conceptual novelty, compliance mechanisms, and practical impact,
targeting AI researchers, fintech practitioners, ethical banking jurists, and
investors.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into online
platforms and digital communication spaces, their potential to influence public
discourse - particularly in contentious areas like climate change - requires
systematic investigation. This study examines how LLMs naturally moderate
climate change conversations through their distinct communicative behaviors. We
conduct a comparative analysis of conversations between LLMs and human users on
social media platforms, using five advanced models: three open-source LLMs
(Gemma, Llama 3, and Llama 3.3) and two commercial systems (GPT-4o by OpenAI
and Claude 3.5 by Anthropic). Through sentiment analysis, we assess the
emotional characteristics of responses from both LLMs and humans. The results
reveal two key mechanisms through which LLMs moderate discourse: first, LLMs
consistently display emotional neutrality, showing far less polarized sentiment
than human users. Second, LLMs maintain lower emotional intensity across
contexts, creating a stabilizing effect in conversations. These findings
suggest that LLMs possess inherent moderating capacities that could improve the
quality of public discourse on controversial topics. This research enhances our
understanding of how AI might support more civil and constructive climate
change discussions and informs the design of AI-assisted communication tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the importance of auditing AI models for alignment, content moderation, and censorship to ensure transparency and access to unbiased information.

Method: Proposed an auditing framework to compare model responses to politically sensitive prompts with their internal chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Found semantic-level information suppression in DeepSeek, with sensitive content like transparency, government accountability, and civic mobilization being omitted or rephrased, and some state propaganda language being amplified.

Conclusion: Stresses the need for systematic auditing of AI models to address alignment, content moderation, and censorship issues for equitable information access.

Abstract: This study examines information suppression mechanisms in DeepSeek, an
open-source large language model (LLM) developed in China. We propose an
auditing framework and use it to analyze the model's responses to 646
politically sensitive prompts by comparing its final output with intermediate
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Our audit unveils evidence of semantic-level
information suppression in DeepSeek: sensitive content often appears within the
model's internal reasoning but is omitted or rephrased in the final output.
Specifically, DeepSeek suppresses references to transparency, government
accountability, and civic mobilization, while occasionally amplifying language
aligned with state propaganda. This study underscores the need for systematic
auditing of alignment, content moderation, information suppression, and
censorship practices implemented into widely-adopted AI models, to ensure
transparency, accountability, and equitable access to unbiased information
obtained by means of these systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Marginalization -- summing a function over all assignments to a subset of its
inputs -- is a fundamental computational problem with applications from
probabilistic inference to formal verification. Despite its computational
hardness in general, there exist many classes of functions (e.g., probabilistic
models) for which marginalization remains tractable, and they can be commonly
expressed by polynomial size arithmetic circuits computing multilinear
polynomials. This raises the question, can all functions with polynomial time
marginalization algorithms be succinctly expressed by such circuits? We give a
negative answer, exhibiting simple functions with tractable marginalization yet
no efficient representation by known models, assuming
$\textsf{FP}\neq\#\textsf{P}$ (an assumption implied by $\textsf{P} \neq
\textsf{NP}$). To this end, we identify a hierarchy of complexity classes
corresponding to stronger forms of marginalization, all of which are
efficiently computable on the known circuit models. We conclude with a
completeness result, showing that whenever there is an efficient real RAM
performing virtual evidence marginalization for a function, then there are
small circuits for that function's multilinear representation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool for economic
research, enabling large-scale simulation and policy optimization. However,
applying AI effectively requires simulation platforms for scalable training and
evaluation-yet existing environments remain limited to simplified, narrowly
scoped tasks, falling short of capturing complex economic challenges such as
demographic shifts, multi-government coordination, and large-scale agent
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EconGym, a scalable and modular
testbed that connects diverse economic tasks with AI algorithms. Grounded in
rigorous economic modeling, EconGym implements 11 heterogeneous role types
(e.g., households, firms, banks, governments), their interaction mechanisms,
and agent models with well-defined observations, actions, and rewards. Users
can flexibly compose economic roles with diverse agent algorithms to simulate
rich multi-agent trajectories across 25+ economic tasks for AI-driven policy
learning and analysis. Experiments show that EconGym supports diverse and
cross-domain tasks-such as coordinating fiscal, pension, and monetary
policies-and enables benchmarking across AI, economic methods, and hybrids.
Results indicate that richer task composition and algorithm diversity expand
the policy space, while AI agents guided by classical economic methods perform
best in complex settings. EconGym also scales to 10k agents with high realism
and efficiency.

Abstract: We present a handcrafted neural network that, without training, solves the
seemingly difficult problem of encoding an arbitrary set of integers into a
single numerical variable, and then recovering the original elements. While
using only standard neural network operations -- weighted sums with biases and
identity activation -- we make design choices that challenge common notions in
this area around representation, continuity of domains, computation,
learnability and more. For example, our construction is designed, not learned;
it represents multiple values using a single one by simply concatenating digits
without compression, and it relies on hardware-level truncation of rightmost
digits as a bit-manipulation mechanism. This neural net is not intended for
practical application. Instead, we see its resemblance to -- and deviation from
-- standard trained autoencoders as an invitation to examine assumptions that
may unnecessarily constrain the development of systems and models based on
autoencoding and machine learning. Motivated in part by our research on a
theory of biological evolution centered around natural autoencoding of species
characteristics, we conclude by refining the discussion with a biological
perspective.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) often suffer from high time complexity $O(T)$
due to the sequential processing of $T$ spikes, making training computationally
expensive.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Fixed-point Parallel Training (FPT) method
to accelerate SNN training without modifying the network architecture or
introducing additional assumptions.
  FPT reduces the time complexity to $O(K)$, where $K$ is a small constant
(usually $K=3$), by using a fixed-point iteration form of Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for all $T$ timesteps.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis of FPT and demonstrate that
existing parallel spiking neurons can be viewed as special cases of our
proposed method.
  Experimental results show that FPT effectively simulates the dynamics of
original LIF neurons, significantly reducing computational time without
sacrificing accuracy.
  This makes FPT a scalable and efficient solution for real-world applications,
particularly for long-term tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper introduces Spectral Fault Receptive Fields (SFRFs), a biologically
inspired technique for degradation state assessment in bearing fault diagnosis
and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Drawing on the center-surround
organization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, we propose a
frequency-domain feature extraction algorithm that enhances the detection of
fault signatures in vibration signals. SFRFs are designed as antagonistic
spectral filters centered on characteristic fault frequencies, with inhibitory
surrounds that enable robust characterization of incipient faults under
variable operating conditions. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization
strategy based on NSGA-II algorithm is employed to tune the receptive field
parameters by simultaneously minimizing RUL prediction error, maximizing
feature monotonicity, and promoting smooth degradation trajectories. The method
is demonstrated on the XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset, confirming its
suitability for constructing condition indicators in health monitoring
applications. Key contributions include: (i) the introduction of SFRFs,
inspired by the biology of vision in the primate retina; (ii) an evolutionary
optimization framework guided by condition monitoring and prognosis criteria;
and (iii) experimental evidence supporting the detection of early-stage faults
and their precursors. Furthermore, we confirm that our diagnosis-informed
spectral representation achieves accurate RUL prediction using a bagging
regressor. The results highlight the interpretability and principled design of
SFRFs, bridging signal processing, biological sensing principles, and
data-driven prognostics in rotating machinery.

Abstract: Active dendrites are the basis for biologically plausible neural networks
possessing many desirable features of the biological brain including
flexibility, dynamic adaptability, and energy efficiency. A formulation for
active dendrites using the notational language of conventional machine learning
is put forward as an alternative to a spiking neuron formulation. Based on this
formulation, neuromorphic dendrites are developed as basic neural building
blocks capable of dynamic online clustering. Features and capabilities of
neuromorphic dendrites are demonstrated via a benchmark drawn from experimental
neuroscience: spike sorting. Spike sorting takes inputs from electrical probes
implanted in neural tissue, detects voltage spikes (action potentials) emitted
by neurons, and attempts to sort the spikes according to the neuron that
emitted them. Many spike sorting methods form clusters based on the shapes of
action potential waveforms, under the assumption that spikes emitted by a given
neuron have similar shapes and will therefore map to the same cluster. Using a
stream of synthetic spike shapes, the accuracy of the proposed dendrite is
compared with the more compute-intensive, offline k-means clustering approach.
Overall, the dendrite outperforms k-means and has the advantage of requiring
only a single pass through the input stream, learning as it goes. The
capabilities of the neuromorphic dendrite are demonstrated for a number of
scenarios including dynamic changes in the input stream, differing neuron spike
rates, and varying neuron counts.

Result: The approach outperforms traditional methods, achieving a WER of 7.9% on LibriMix and 32.9% on AMI SDM with a biasing size of 1,000.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively enhances ASR performance in complex speech scenarios by integrating multi-talker recognition and contextual biasing.

Abstract: In real-world applications, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems must
handle overlapping speech from multiple speakers and recognize rare words like
technical terms. Traditional methods address multi-talker ASR and contextual
biasing separately, limiting performance in complex scenarios. We propose a
unified framework that combines multi-talker overlapping speech recognition and
contextual biasing into a single task. Our ASR method integrates pretrained

strategies. We also introduce a two-stage filtering algorithm to efficiently
identify relevant rare words from large biasing lists and incorporate them into
the LLM's prompt input, enhancing rare word recognition. Experiments show that
our approach outperforms traditional contextual biasing methods, achieving a
WER of 7.9% on LibriMix and 32.9% on AMI SDM when the biasing size is 1,000,

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This study compares logit-based and probability-based GOP scores for mispronunciation detection, finding that logit-based methods outperform in classification but effectiveness varies with dataset characteristics. Hybrid methods combining both approaches with uncertainty modeling and phoneme weighting are recommended.


<details>

Motivation: Traditional softmax-based posterior probabilities for GOP scores can be overconfident and have poor phoneme separation, which limits their effectiveness in pronunciation assessment.

Method: The study compared logit-based GOP scores with probability-based GOP scores on two L2 English datasets (Dutch and Mandarin speakers) using classification performance and correlation with human ratings.

Result: Logit-based GOP methods showed better classification performance than probability-based ones, but their effectiveness depends on dataset characteristics. Maximum logit GOP aligned most strongly with human perception, while combinations of scores balanced features.

Conclusion: Hybrid GOP methods that include uncertainty modeling and phoneme-specific weighting can enhance pronunciation assessment.

Abstract: Pronunciation assessment relies on goodness of pronunciation (GOP) scores,
traditionally derived from softmax-based posterior probabilities. However,
posterior probabilities may suffer from overconfidence and poor phoneme
separation, limiting their effectiveness. This study compares logit-based GOP
scores with probability-based GOP scores for mispronunciation detection. We
conducted our experiment on two L2 English speech datasets spoken by Dutch and
Mandarin speakers, assessing classification performance and correlation with
human ratings. Logit-based methods outperform probability-based GOP in
classification, but their effectiveness depends on dataset characteristics. The
maximum logit GOP shows the strongest alignment with human perception, while a
combination of different GOP scores balances probability and logit features.
The findings suggest that hybrid GOP methods incorporating uncertainty modeling

Abstract: Explainable ML algorithms are designed to provide transparency and insight
into their decision-making process. Explaining how ML models come to their
prediction is critical in fields such as healthcare and finance, as it provides
insight into how models can help detect bias in predictions and help comply
with GDPR compliance in these fields. QML leverages quantum phenomena such as
entanglement and superposition, offering the potential for computational
speedup and greater insights compared to classical ML. However, QML models also
inherit the black-box nature of their classical counterparts, requiring the
development of explainability techniques to be applied to these QML models to

  This paper will explore the idea of creating a modular, explainable QML
framework that splits QML algorithms into their core components, such as
feature maps, variational circuits (ansatz), optimizers, kernels, and
quantum-classical loops. Each component will be analyzed using explainability
techniques, such as ALE and SHAP, which have been adapted to analyse the
different components of these QML algorithms. By combining insights from these

Abstract: Quantum magnetic sensing based on spin systems has emerged as a new paradigm
for detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity,
revitalizing applications in navigation, geo-localization, biology, and beyond.
At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies
the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the
underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly
rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven
principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum
sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently
or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing
accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a
two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with
a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the
2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune
the sensing parameters within a reduced search space. The proposed protocol is
developed and evaluated in a challenging context of single-shot readout of an

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing frequency domain methods in estimating flicker components under noisy and uncertain conditions.

Method: Combining H filtering for voltage envelope extraction with ADALINE for flicker frequency identification.

Result: Superior accuracy, robustness, and reduced computational load compared to FFT and DWT-based estimators.

Conclusion: The hybrid AI model effectively handles complex power disturbances without needing prior noise knowledge or extensive training.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hybrid AI method combining H filtering and an
adaptive linear neuron network for flicker component estimation in power
distribution systems.The proposed method leverages the robustness of the H
filter to extract the voltage envelope under uncertain and noisy conditions
followed by the use of ADALINE to accurately identify flicker frequencies
embedded in the envelope.This synergy enables efficient time domain estimation
with rapid convergence and noise resilience addressing key limitations of
existing frequency domain approaches.Unlike conventional techniques this hybrid
AI model handles complex power disturbances without prior knowledge of noise

TL;DR: The paper presents a generalized aCSS framework for nonlinear regularization and robust estimators, with theoretical analysis on validity and power optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend aCSS methods beyond current limitations of linear/ smooth regularization and provide theoretical insights into power.

Method: Generalized framework for nonlinear regularization, weighted sampling scheme, and unification of conditional sampling methods.

Result: Theoretical validity and power optimality of aCSS in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: The generalized aCSS framework broadens the applicability of aCSS to various estimators and methods, offering enhanced flexibility and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Approximate co-sufficient sampling (aCSS) offers a principled route to
hypothesis testing when null distributions are unknown, yet current
implementations are confined to maximum likelihood estimators with smooth or
linear regularization and provide little theoretical insight into power. We
present a generalized framework that widens the scope of the aCSS method to
embrace nonlinear regularization, such as group lasso and nonconvex penalties,
as well as robust and nonparametric estimators. Moreover, we introduce a
weighted sampling scheme for enhanced flexibility and propose a generalized
aCSS framework that unifies existing conditional sampling methods. Our
theoretical analysis rigorously establishes validity and, for the first time,
characterizes the power optimality of aCSS procedures in certain
high-dimensional settings.

*Ha-Young Shin,Hee-Seok Oh*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces data-based geometric quantiles on Hadamard spaces, offering theoretical advantages over parameter-based methods, such as strong consistency, asymptotic normality, and better distribution shape adherence, validated through simulations and real data experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an alternative approach to geometric quantiles in Hadamard spaces that provides better theoretical properties and practical benefits compared to existing parameter-based methodologies.

Method: The paper proposes a data-based definition of geometric quantiles, contrasting it with parameter-based methods, and analyzes its theoretical advantages through large-sample properties. Simulations and real diffusion tensor imaging data on symmetric positive definite matrices are used to explore computational simplicity and distribution adherence.

Result: Data-based geometric quantiles demonstrate theoretical advantages like strong consistency, asymptotic normality, breakdown points, extreme quantiles, and favorable gradient properties. Simulations show simpler computation and better distribution shape adherence, while real data experiments illustrate their utility in testing distribution equivalences and measuring distributional characteristics.

Conclusion: The data-based framework for geometric quantiles offers significant improvements over parameter-based methods, with practical benefits in computation and distribution alignment, making it a valuable tool for analyzing data on manifolds such as symmetric positive definite matrices.

Abstract: This paper defines an alternative notion, described as data-based, of
geometric quantiles on Hadamard spaces, in contrast to the existing
methodology, described as parameter-based. In addition to having the same
desirable properties as parameter-based quantiles, these data-based quantiles
are shown to have several theoretical advantages related to large-sample
properties like strong consistency and asymptotic normality, breakdown points,
extreme quantiles and the gradient of the loss function. Using simulations, we
explore some other advantages of the data-based framework, including simpler
computation and better adherence to the shape of the distribution, before
performing experiments with real diffusion tensor imaging data lying on a
manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. These experiments illustrate
some of the uses of these quantiles by testing the equivalence of the
generating distributions of different data sets and measuring distributional
characteristics.

### [545] [Joint Quantile Shrinkage: A State-Space Approach toward Non-Crossing Bayesian Quantile Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13257)
*David Kohns,Tibor Szendrei*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian framework to prevent crossing in quantile regression by using a fused shrinkage prior and a state-space model, showing better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crossing of fitted conditional quantiles is a common issue in quantile regression models, which can lead to inconsistent or invalid results. Existing methods may not effectively address this problem, especially in multivariate settings.

Method: The authors propose a Bayesian model that jointly estimates multiple quantiles with a prior on their variation across quantiles and a fused shrinkage prior that adapts to quantiles. They derive the posterior using a decision-theoretic general Bayes approach, leading to a state-space interpretation similar to TVP models.

Result: The framework shows improved parameter recovery and predictive performance compared to Bayesian and frequentist quantile regression estimators in simulations and a macroeconomic data application.

Conclusion: The proposed QVP model effectively prevents quantile crossing and offers better performance, suggesting its potential for use in econometric analyses involving multivariate quantile estimation.

Abstract: Crossing of fitted conditional quantiles is a prevalent problem for quantile
regression models. We propose a new Bayesian modelling framework that penalises
multiple quantile regression functions toward the desired non-crossing space.
We achieve this by estimating multiple quantiles jointly with a prior on
variation across quantiles, a fused shrinkage prior with quantile adaptivity.
The posterior is derived from a decision-theoretic general Bayes perspective,
whose form yields a natural state-space interpretation aligned with
Time-Varying Parameter (TVP) models. Taken together our approach leads to a
Quantile- Varying Parameter (QVP) model, for which we develop efficient
sampling algorithms. We demonstrate that our proposed modelling framework
provides superior parameter recovery and predictive performance compared to
competing Bayesian and frequentist quantile regression estimators in simulated
experiments and a real-data application to multivariate quantile estimation in
macroeconomics.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Collaborative robots must quickly adapt to their partner's intent and
preferences to proactively identify helpful actions. This is especially true in
situated settings where human partners can continually teach robots new
high-level behaviors, visual concepts, and physical skills (e.g., through
demonstration), growing the robot's capabilities as the human-robot pair work
together to accomplish diverse tasks. In this work, we argue that robots should
be able to infer their partner's goals from early interactions and use this
information to proactively plan behaviors ahead of explicit instructions from
the user. Building from the strong commonsense priors and steerability of large
language models, we introduce ProVox ("Proactive Voice"), a novel framework
that enables robots to efficiently personalize and adapt to individual
collaborators. We design a meta-prompting protocol that empowers users to
communicate their distinct preferences, intent, and expected robot behaviors
ahead of starting a physical interaction. ProVox then uses the personalized
prompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a
user's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to
suggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the
amount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot.
We evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation
tasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the
collaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use,
and reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity
are critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less
user burden relative to non-active baselines. Supplementary material, code, and

Conclusion: The conclusion advocates for interdisciplinary collaboration, benchmarking, and human-AI integration to achieve fully autonomous experimental labs, emphasizing the need for addressing current limitations to realize the potential of foundation models.

Abstract: This review explores the potential of foundation models to advance laboratory
automation in the materials and chemical sciences. It emphasizes the dual roles
of these models: cognitive functions for experimental planning and data
analysis, and physical functions for hardware operations. While traditional
laboratory automation has relied heavily on specialized, rigid systems,
foundation models offer adaptability through their general-purpose intelligence
and multimodal capabilities. Recent advancements have demonstrated the
feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) and multimodal robotic
systems to handle complex and dynamic laboratory tasks. However, significant
challenges remain, including precision manipulation of hardware, integration of
multimodal data, and ensuring operational safety. This paper outlines a roadmap
highlighting future directions, advocating for close interdisciplinary
collaboration, benchmark establishment, and strategic human-AI integration to

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Representing articulated objects remains a difficult problem within the field
of robotics. Objects such as pliers, clamps, or cabinets require
representations that capture not only geometry and color information, but also
part seperation, connectivity, and joint parametrization. Furthermore, learning
these representations becomes even more difficult with each additional degree
of freedom. Complex articulated objects such as robot arms may have seven or
more degrees of freedom, and the depth of their kinematic tree may be notably
greater than the tools, drawers, and cabinets that are the typical subjects of
articulated object research. To address these concerns, we introduce SPLATART -
a pipeline for learning Gaussian splat representations of articulated objects
from posed images, of which a subset contains image space part segmentations.
SPLATART disentangles the part separation task from the articulation estimation
task, allowing for post-facto determination of joint estimation and
representation of articulated objects with deeper kinematic trees than
previously exhibited. In this work, we present data on the SPLATART pipeline as
applied to the syntheic Paris dataset objects, and qualitative results on a
real-world object under spare segmentation supervision. We additionally present
on articulated serial chain manipulators to demonstrate usage on deeper
kinematic tree structures.

TL;DR: ViTaSCOPE is a method for estimating object poses and contact locations using vision and tactile data, improving dexterous manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating object poses and contact locations is challenging due to partial and noisy observations in dexterous manipulation tasks.

Method: ViTaSCOPE uses neural implicit representations, combining vision and tactile feedback as signed distance fields and neural shear fields.

Result: The method shows success in simulated and real-world experiments for dexterous manipulation.

Conclusion: ViTaSCOPE bridges the sim-to-real gap, enabling effective object manipulation with visuo-tactile cues.

Abstract: Mastering dexterous, contact-rich object manipulation demands precise
estimation of both in-hand object poses and external contact
locations$\unicode{x2013}$tasks particularly challenging due to partial and
noisy observations. We present ViTaSCOPE: Visuo-Tactile Simultaneous Contact
and Object Pose Estimation, an object-centric neural implicit representation
that fuses vision and high-resolution tactile feedback. By representing objects
as signed distance fields and distributed tactile feedback as neural shear
fields, ViTaSCOPE accurately localizes objects and registers extrinsic contacts
onto their 3D geometry as contact fields. Our method enables seamless reasoning
over complementary visuo-tactile cues by leveraging simulation for scalable
training and zero-shot transfers to the real-world by bridging the sim-to-real
gap. We evaluate our method through comprehensive simulated and real-world
experiments, demonstrating its capabilities in dexterous manipulation
scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AntiGrounding framework improves robotic manipulation by preserving task-specific details in VLMs and enabling zero-shot trajectory synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM approaches for robotic manipulation lose important task-specific information when using compressed intermediate representations.

Method: AntiGrounding reverses instruction grounding to lift actions into VLM space, uses multi-view trajectory rendering, and structured VQA for decision making.

Result: Experiments show superior performance over baselines in both simulation and real-world robotic tasks.

Conclusion: The method enables effective zero-shot synthesis of robot trajectories and enhances long-term performance through offline policy refinement.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode knowledge and reasoning capabilities for
robotic manipulation within high-dimensional representation spaces. However,
current approaches often project them into compressed intermediate
representations, discarding important task-specific information such as
fine-grained spatial or semantic details. To address this, we propose
AntiGrounding, a new framework that reverses the instruction grounding process.
It lifts candidate actions directly into the VLM representation space, renders
trajectories from multiple views, and uses structured visual question answering
for instruction-based decision making. This enables zero-shot synthesis of
optimal closed-loop robot trajectories for new tasks. We also propose an
offline policy refinement module that leverages past experience to enhance
long-term performance. Experiments in both simulation and real-world
environments show that our method outperforms baselines across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a
remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors.
However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when
faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds,
or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit
corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be
costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does
not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can
directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities
with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with
in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil.
The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally
correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an
expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of
collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our
method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current
observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training
observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence
feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD
observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform
deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse
real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator.
Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the
generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and
environment conditions with low feedback.

Abstract: In the field of multi-sensor fusion for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), monocular cameras and IMUs are widely used to build simple and
effective visual-inertial systems. However, limited research has explored the
integration of motor-encoder devices to enhance SLAM performance. By
incorporating such devices, it is possible to significantly improve active
capability and field of view (FOV) with minimal additional cost and structural
complexity. This paper proposes a novel visual-inertial-encoder tightly coupled
odometry (VIEO) based on a ViDAR (Video Detection and Ranging) device. A ViDAR
calibration method is introduced to ensure accurate initialization for VIEO. In
addition, a platform motion decoupled active SLAM method based on deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. Experimental data demonstrate that
the proposed ViDAR and the VIEO algorithm significantly increase cross-frame
co-visibility relationships compared to its corresponding visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) algorithm, improving state estimation accuracy. Additionally,
the DRL-based active SLAM algorithm, with the ability to decouple from platform
motion, can increase the diversity weight of the feature points and further
enhance the VIEO algorithm's performance. The proposed methodology sheds fresh
insights into both the updated platform design and decoupled approach of active
SLAM systems in complex environments.

Abstract: Accurate rotational odometry is crucial for autonomous robotic systems,
particularly for small, power-constrained platforms such as drones and mobile
robots. This study introduces thermal-gyro fusion, a novel sensor fusion
approach that integrates ultra-low-resolution thermal imaging with gyroscope
readings for rotational odometry. Unlike RGB cameras, thermal imaging is
invariant to lighting conditions and, when fused with gyroscopic data,
mitigates drift which is a common limitation of inertial sensors. We first
develop a multimodal data acquisition system to collect synchronized thermal
and gyroscope data, along with rotational speed labels, across diverse
environments. Subsequently, we design and train a lightweight Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) that fuses both modalities for rotational speed
estimation. Our analysis demonstrates that thermal-gyro fusion enables a
significant reduction in thermal camera resolution without significantly
compromising accuracy, thereby improving computational efficiency and memory
utilization. These advantages make our approach well-suited for real-time
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems. Finally, to facilitate
further research, we publicly release our dataset as supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic grasping in structured environments (e.g., stacks) is underexplored compared to isolated or unstructured objects, yet critical for applications like construction and warehouse automation.

Method: Proposes a camera-IMU based approach that prioritizes unobstructed objects in higher stack layers, along with a dataset and evaluation metric combining object selection and pose accuracy.

Result: The method performs well but achieving completely error-free solutions remains challenging, with successful deployment in a construction scenario's brick-picking application.

Conclusion: While the proposed method shows promise for structured object grasping, the problem remains challenging for error-free solutions, highlighting the need for further research.

Abstract: Vision-based robotic object grasping is typically investigated in the context
of isolated objects or unstructured object sets in bin picking scenarios.
However, there are several settings, such as construction or warehouse
automation, where a robot needs to interact with a structured object formation
such as a stack. In this context, we define the problem of selecting suitable
objects for grasping along with estimating an accurate 6DoF pose of these
objects. To address this problem, we propose a camera-IMU based approach that
prioritizes unobstructed objects on the higher layers of stacks and introduce a
dataset for benchmarking and evaluation, along with a suitable evaluation
metric that combines object selection with pose accuracy. Experimental results
show that although our method can perform quite well, this is a challenging
problem if a completely error-free solution is needed. Finally, we show results
from the deployment of our method for a brick-picking application in a
construction scenario.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently made significant advance in
multi-task, end-to-end robotic control, due to the strong generalization
capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). A fundamental challenge in
developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with
the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly
fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers
from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and
heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level
semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical
space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models
anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve
alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state
estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model
to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting
performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in
low-data regimes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Data-driven approaches struggle with precise manipulation; imitation learning
requires many hard-to-obtain demonstrations, while reinforcement learning
yields brittle, non-generalizable policies. We introduce VisuoTactile Local
(ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation
tasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a
vision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the
object of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable,
scene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric
vision and tactile sensing. This approach is motivated by the observation that
while scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across
task instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they
can generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy. ViTaL achieves around 90%
success on contact-rich tasks in unseen environments and is robust to
distractors. ViTaL's effectiveness stems from three key insights: (1)
foundation models for segmentation enable training robust visual encoders via
behavior cloning; (2) these encoders improve the generalizability of policies
learned using residual RL; and (3) tactile sensing significantly boosts
performance in contact-rich tasks. Ablation studies validate each of these
insights, and we demonstrate that ViTaL integrates well with high-level VLMs,
enabling robust, reusable low-level skills. Results and videos are available at

Abstract: In autonomous underwater missions, the successful completion of predefined

Hierarchical Navigation Strategy (HNS) as the main navigation engine to infer
local motions and provide the BlueROV2 with full autonomy to follow an
obstacle-free trajectory in a water container of 2.5m x 2.5m x 3.5m. Compared
to traditional navigation architectures, using the proposed method, we observe
a robust path following behaviour in the presence of uncertainty and noise. We
found that the proposed approach provides the BlueROV with a more complete
sensory picture about its surroundings while real-time navigation planning is
performed by the concurrent execution of two or more tasks.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are promising to acquire various skills by imitating human

paper presents a physics-based humanoid control framework, aiming to master
highly-dynamic human behaviors such as Kungfu and dancing through multi-steps
motion processing and adaptive motion tracking. For motion processing, we
design a pipeline to extract, filter out, correct, and retarget motions, while
ensuring compliance with physical constraints to the maximum extent. For motion
imitation, we formulate a bi-level optimization problem to dynamically adjust
the tracking accuracy tolerance based on the current tracking error, creating
an adaptive curriculum mechanism. We further construct an asymmetric
actor-critic framework for policy training. In experiments, we train whole-body
control policies to imitate a set of highly-dynamic motions. Our method
achieves significantly lower tracking errors than existing approaches and is
successfully deployed on the Unitree G1 robot, demonstrating stable and

Abstract: Solving Inverse Kinematics (IK) problems is fundamental to robotics, but has
primarily been successful with single serial manipulators. For multi-arm
robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled
joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK
solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this
paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and
diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns
the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex
dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems
of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional
objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and
adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different
multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy,
precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing
solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach
to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm
robotic systems in real-time manipulation tasks.

a stimulating application of the swarm robotic system. It involves a large
number of autonomous robots of heterogeneous behavior, coordination among them,
and their interaction with the dynamic environment. This process of complex
structure formation is considered a complex system, which needs to be modeled
by using any modeling approach. Although the formal specification approach
along with other formal methods has been used to model the behavior of robots
in a swarm. However, to the best of our knowledge, the formal specification
approach has not been used to model the self-organization process in swarm
robotic systems for shape formation. In this paper, we use a formal
specification approach to model the shape formation task of swarm robots. We
use Z (Zed) language of formal specification, which is a state-based language,
to model the states of the entities of the systems. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Z for the self-organized shape formation. The presented formal
specification model gives the outlines for designing and implementing the swarm
robotic system for the formation of complex shapes and structures. It also
provides the foundation for modeling the complex shape formation process for
swarm robotics using a multi-agent system in a simulation-based environment.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong semantic
understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet most existing systems assume an
accurate low-level controller with hand-crafted action "vocabulary" such as
end-effector pose or root velocity. This assumption confines prior work to
quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by
humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature,
we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language,
closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10
categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot
Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid
vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language
policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic
demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes
these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark,
LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation
tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical
whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a novel latency minimization problem in wireless
federated learning (FL) across multi-hop networks. The system comprises
multiple routes, each integrating leaf and relay nodes for FL model training.
We explore a personalized learning and adaptive aggregation-aware FL (PAFL)
framework that effectively addresses data heterogeneity across participating
nodes by harmonizing individual and collective learning objectives. We
formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing system latency through
the joint optimization of leaf and relay nodes, as well as relay routing
indicator. We also incorporate an additional energy harvesting scheme for the
relay nodes to help with their relay tasks. This formulation presents a
computationally demanding challenge, and thus we develop a simple yet efficient
algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation
(SCA) techniques. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of our proposed
joint optimization approach for leaf and relay nodes with relay routing
indicator. We observe significant latency savings in the wireless multi-hop
PAFL system, with reductions of up to 69.37% compared to schemes optimizing
only one node type, traditional greedy algorithm, and scheme without relay
routing indicator.

Abstract: As access to information becomes more open and widespread, people are
increasingly using AI tools for assistance. However, many of these tools
struggle to estimate the trustworthiness of the information. Although today's
search engines include AI features, they often fail to offer clear indicators
of data reliability. To address this gap, we introduce WebTrust, a system
designed to simplify the process of finding and judging credible information
online. Built on a fine-tuned version of IBM's Granite-1B model and trained on
a custom dataset, WebTrust works by assigning a reliability score (from 0.1 to
1) to each statement it processes. In addition, it offers a clear justification
for why a piece of information received that score. Evaluated using prompt
engineering, WebTrust consistently achieves superior performance compared to
other small-scale LLMs and rule-based approaches, outperforming them across all
experiments on MAE, RMSE, and R2. User testing showed that when reliability
scores are displayed alongside search results, people feel more confident and
satisfied with the information they find. With its accuracy, transparency, and
ease of use, WebTrust offers a practical solution to help combat misinformation
and make trustworthy information more accessible to everyone.

Abstract: The implementation of transformational pedagogy in secondary education
classrooms requires a broad multiliteracy approach. Due to limited planning
time and resources, high school English Literature teachers often struggle to
curate diverse, thematically aligned literature text sets. This study addresses
the critical need for a tool that provides scaffolds for novice educators in
selecting literature texts that are diverse -- in terms of genre, theme,
subtheme, and author -- yet similar in context and pedagogical merits. We have
developed a recommendation system, Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher
Scaffolding (T-TExTS), that suggests high school English Literature books based
on pedagogical merits, genre, and thematic relevance using a knowledge graph.
We constructed a domain-specific ontology using the KNowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM), transformed into a knowledge graph, which
was then embedded using DeepWalk, biased random walk, and a hybrid of both
approaches. The system was evaluated using link prediction and recommendation
performance metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), Mean Reciprocal Rank
(MRR), Hits@K, and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). DeepWalk
outperformed in most ranking metrics, with the highest AUC (0.9431), whereas
the hybrid model offered balanced performance. These findings demonstrate the
importance of semantic, ontology-driven approaches in recommendation systems
and suggest that T-TExTS can significantly ease the burden of English
Literature text selection for high school educators, promoting more informed
and inclusive curricular decisions. The source code for T-TExTS is available

Abstract: Comparative studies of news coverage are challenging to conduct because
methods to identify news articles about the same event in different languages
require expertise that is difficult to scale. We introduce an AI-powered method
for identifying news articles based on an event FINGERPRINT, which is a minimal
set of metadata required to identify critical events. Our event coverage
identification method, FINGERPRINT TO ARTICLE MATCHING FOR EVENTS (FAME),
efficiently identifies news articles about critical world events, specifically
terrorist attacks and several types of natural disasters. FAME does not require
training data and is able to automatically and efficiently identify news
articles that discuss an event given its fingerprint: time, location, and class
(such as storm or flood). The method achieves state-of-the-art performance and
scales to massive databases of tens of millions of news articles and hundreds
of events happening globally. We use FAME to identify 27,441 articles that
cover 470 natural disaster and terrorist attack events that happened in 2020.
To this end, we use a massive database of news articles in three languages from
MediaCloud, and three widely used, expert-curated databases of critical events:
EM-DAT, USGS, and GTD. Our case study reveals patterns consistent with prior
literature: coverage of disasters and terrorist attacks correlates to death
counts, to the GDP of a country where the event occurs, and to trade volume
between the reporting country and the country where the event occurred. We
share our NLP annotations and cross-country media attention data to support the
efforts of researchers and media monitoring organizations.

Abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a vital resource for investigative journalists doing

Overpass Turbo require familiarity with complex query languages, creating
barriers for non-technical users. We present SPOT, an open source natural
language interface that makes OSM's rich, tag-based geographic data more
accessible through intuitive scene descriptions. SPOT interprets user inputs as
structured representations of geospatial object configurations using fine-tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs), with results being displayed in an interactive
map interface. While more general geospatial search tasks are conceivable, SPOT
is specifically designed for use in investigative journalism, addressing
real-world challenges such as hallucinations in model output, inconsistencies
in OSM tagging, and the noisy nature of user input. It combines a novel
synthetic data pipeline with a semantic bundling system to enable robust,
accurate query generation. To our knowledge, SPOT is the first system to
achieve reliable natural language access to OSM data at this level of accuracy.
By lowering the technical barrier to geolocation verification, SPOT contributes
a practical tool to the broader efforts to support fact-checking and combat
disinformation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Per-garment virtual try-on methods collect garment-specific datasets and
train networks tailored to each garment to achieve superior results. However,
these approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key
limitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with
the body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by
loose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment
synthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information,
leading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we
extract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This
representation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the
semantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under
loose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. Furthermore,
we introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal
dependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time
performance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image
quality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the
effectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent
synthesis framework.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Digital human video generation is gaining traction in fields like education
and e-commerce, driven by advancements in head-body animation and lip-syncing
technologies. However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex
dynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges.
Generating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues
such as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and
orientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and
importantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper
presents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment
generation. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process
method, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT)
model. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object
into the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second
stage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions. The
key contribution of our method is to reuse the pretrained model's context
perception capabilities without introducing additional parameters, enabling
strong generalization to unseen objects and scenarios, and our proposed
paradigm naturally supports long video generation. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in
challenging real-world scenes, offering enhanced realism and more seamless
hand-object interactions.

Abstract: Neural implicit shape representation has drawn significant attention in
recent years due to its smoothness, differentiability, and topological
flexibility. However, directly modeling the shape of a neural implicit surface,
especially as the zero-level set of a neural signed distance function (SDF),
with sparse geometric control is still a challenging task. Sparse input shape
control typically includes 3D curve networks or, more generally, 3D curve
sketches, which are unstructured and cannot be connected to form a curve
network, and therefore more difficult to deal with. While 3D curve networks or
curve sketches provide intuitive shape control, their sparsity and varied
topology pose challenges in generating high-quality surfaces to meet such curve
constraints. In this paper, we propose NeuVAS, a variational approach to shape
modeling using neural implicit surfaces constrained under sparse input shape
control, including unstructured 3D curve sketches as well as connected 3D curve
networks. Specifically, we introduce a smoothness term based on a functional of
surface curvatures to minimize shape variation of the zero-level set surface of
a neural SDF. We also develop a new technique to faithfully model G0 sharp
feature curves as specified in the input curve sketches. Comprehensive
comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the significant
advantages of our method.

Motivation: To improve inverse rendering in complex capture scenarios, especially for highly reflective scenes with intricate high-frequency specular radiance components.

Method: Geometrically and physically grounded Gaussian Splatting with spatially variable normals and material properties via per-primitive texture maps and GPU hardware acceleration.

Result: Demonstrates improved novel view synthesis performance and efficient rendering in complex reflective scenes.

Conclusion: Increased representation power through variable normals and materials, along with GPU acceleration, effectively addresses challenges in inverse rendering for highly reflective environments.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated remarkable novel view synthesis
performance at high rendering frame rates. Optimization-based inverse rendering
within complex capture scenarios remains however a challenging problem. A
particular case is modelling complex surface light interactions for highly
reflective scenes, which results in intricate high frequency specular radiance
components. We hypothesize that such challenging settings can benefit from
increased representation power. We hence propose a method that tackles this
issue through a geometrically and physically grounded Gaussian Splatting borne
radiance field, where normals and material properties are spatially variable in
the primitive's local space. Using per-primitive texture maps for this purpose,
we also propose to harness the GPU hardware to accelerate rendering at test
time via unified material texture atlas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a system that can produce detailed, photorealistic gigapixel images from casually taken photos, which is challenging due to the need for accurate scale estimation and degradation alignment in arbitrary materials.

Method: UltraZoom constructs a per-instance paired dataset from close-ups and adapts a pretrained generative model to learn low-to-high resolution mappings. It uses a sliding window approach during inference and introduces a robust registration method for aligning close-ups within the full image.

Result: The system enables seamless pan and zoom across the entire object, generating consistent and photorealistic gigapixel images with minimal input.

Conclusion: UltraZoom effectively addresses the challenge of creating high-resolution images from casual photos by combining dataset adaptation, generative models, and robust registration, making it feasible to produce detailed imagery with minimal user input.

Abstract: We present UltraZoom, a system for generating gigapixel-resolution images of
objects from casually captured inputs, such as handheld phone photos. Given a
full-shot image (global, low-detail) and one or more close-ups (local,
high-detail), UltraZoom upscales the full image to match the fine detail and
scale of the close-up examples. To achieve this, we construct a per-instance
paired dataset from the close-ups and adapt a pretrained generative model to
learn object-specific low-to-high resolution mappings. At inference, we apply
the model in a sliding window fashion over the full image. Constructing these
pairs is non-trivial: it requires registering the close-ups within the full
image for scale estimation and degradation alignment. We introduce a simple,
robust method for getting registration on arbitrary materials in casual,
in-the-wild captures. Together, these components form a system that enables
seamless pan and zoom across the entire object, producing consistent,
photorealistic gigapixel imagery from minimal input.

Motivation: To investigate how music education, as an environmental factor, influences cognitive development in early childhood, particularly in spatial-temporal skills.

Method: The study employed the Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PFS) method by Yager, creating PFS from expert opinions and developing an algorithm with Expectation Score Function for ranking.

Result: The algorithm's rankings matched the experts' rankings regarding the development of spatial-temporal skills in music education for early childhood.

Conclusion: Music education positively affects cognitive development in early childhood, especially spatial intelligence, as supported by the PFS method and expert data.

Abstract: There are many genetic and environmental factors that affect cognitive

This study created PFS based on experts' opinions, and an algorithm was given

development of spatial-temporal skills in music education given in early
childhood. The algorithm's ranking was done using the Expectation Score
Function. The rankings obtained from the algorithm overlap with the experts'

Abstract: Recent achievements in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) have

intracranial brain recordings; however, individual physiological and electrode
implantation heterogeneities have constrained current approaches to neural
decoding within single individuals, rendering interindividual neural decoding
elusive. Here, we present Multi-individual Brain Region-Aggregated Network
(MIBRAIN), a neural decoding framework that constructs a whole functional brain
network model by integrating intracranial neurophysiological recordings across
multiple individuals. MIBRAIN leverages self-supervised learning to derive
generalized neural prototypes and supports group-level analysis of brain-region
interactions and inter-subject neural synchrony. To validate our framework, we
recorded stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) signals from a cohort of
individuals performing Mandarin syllable articulation. Both real-time online
and offline decoding experiments demonstrated significant improvements in both
audible and silent articulation decoding, enhanced decoding accuracy with
increased multi-subject data integration, and effective generalization to
unseen subjects. Furthermore, neural predictions for regions without direct
electrode coverage were validated against authentic neural data. Overall, this
framework paves the way for robust neural decoding across individuals and
offers insights for practical clinical applications.

Abstract: Because we are highly motivated to be understood, we created public external
representations -- mime, language, art -- to externalise our inner states. We
argue that such external representations are a pre-condition for access
consciousness, the global availability of information for reasoning. Yet the
bandwidth of access consciousness is tiny compared with the richness of `raw
experience', so no external representation can reproduce that richness in full.
Ordinarily an explanation of experience need only let an audience `grasp' the
relevant pattern, not relive the phenomenon. But our drive to be understood,
and our low level sensorimotor capacities for `grasping' so rich, that the
demand for an explanation of the feel of experience cannot be ``satisfactory''.
That inflated epistemic demand (the preeminence of our expectation that we
could be perfectly understood by another or ourselves) rather than an
irreducible metaphysical gulf -- keeps the hard problem of consciousness alive.
But on the plus side, it seems we will simply never give up creating new ways
to communicate and think about our experiences. In this view, to be consciously
aware is to strive to have one's agency understood by oneself and others.

Abstract: Despite variations in architecture and pretraining strategies, recent studies
indicate that large-scale AI models often converge toward similar internal
representations that also align with neural activity. We propose that
scale-invariance, a fundamental structural principle in natural systems, is a
key driver of this convergence. In this work, we propose a multi-scale
analytical framework to quantify two core aspects of scale-invariance in AI
representations: dimensional stability and structural similarity across scales.
We further investigate whether these properties can predict alignment
performance with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) responses in the
visual cortex. Our analysis reveals that embeddings with more consistent
dimension and higher structural similarity across scales align better with fMRI
data. Furthermore, we find that the manifold structure of fMRI data is more
concentrated, with most features dissipating at smaller scales. Embeddings with
similar scale patterns align more closely with fMRI data. We also show that
larger pretraining datasets and the inclusion of language modalities enhance
the scale-invariance properties of embeddings, further improving neural
alignment. Our findings indicate that scale-invariance is a fundamental
structural principle that bridges artificial and biological representations,
providing a new framework for evaluating the structural quality of human-like
AI systems.

Abstract: The widespread use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the rise of deep
learning have enabled the development of powerful predictive models for a wide
range of diagnostic tasks in MRI, such as image classification or object
segmentation. However, training models for specific new tasks often requires
large amounts of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain due to high
annotation costs and data privacy concerns. To circumvent this issue, we
introduce MRI-CORE (MRI COmprehensive Representation Encoder), a vision
foundation model pre-trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110,000
MRI volumes across 18 main body locations. Experiments on five diverse object
segmentation tasks in MRI demonstrate that MRI-CORE can significantly improve
segmentation performance in realistic scenarios with limited labeled data
availability, achieving an average gain of 6.97% 3D Dice Coefficient using only
10 annotated slices per task. We further demonstrate new model capabilities in
MRI such as classification of image properties including body location,
sequence type and institution, and zero-shot segmentation. These results
highlight the value of MRI-CORE as a generalist vision foundation model for
MRI, potentially lowering the data annotation resource barriers for many
applications.

Abstract: AI requires extensive datasets, while medical data is subject to high data
protection. Anonymization is essential, but poses a challenge for some regions,
such as the head, as identifying structures overlap with regions of clinical
interest. Synthetic data offers a potential solution, but studies often lack
rigorous evaluation of realism and utility. Therefore, we investigate to what
extent synthetic data can replace real data in segmentation tasks. We employed
head and neck cancer CT scans and brain glioma MRI scans from two large
datasets. Synthetic data were generated using generative adversarial networks
and diffusion models. We evaluated the quality of the synthetic data using MAE,
MS-SSIM, Radiomics and a Visual Turing Test (VTT) performed by 5 radiologists
and their usefulness in segmentation tasks using DSC. Radiomics indicates high
fidelity of synthetic MRIs, but fall short in producing highly realistic CT
tissue, with correlation coefficient of 0.8784 and 0.5461 for MRI and CT
tumors, respectively. DSC results indicate limited utility of synthetic data:
tumor segmentation achieved DSC=0.064 on CT and 0.834 on MRI, while bone
segmentation a mean DSC=0.841. Relation between DSC and correlation is
observed, but is limited by the complexity of the task. VTT results show
synthetic CTs' utility, but with limited educational applications. Synthetic
data can be used independently for the segmentation task, although limited by
the complexity of the structures to segment. Advancing generative models to
better tolerate heterogeneous inputs and learn subtle details is essential for
enhancing their realism and expanding their application potential.

Abstract: Super-Resolution (SR) is a critical task in computer vision, focusing on
reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. The
field has seen significant progress through various challenges, particularly in
single-image SR. Video Super-Resolution (VSR) extends this to the temporal
domain, aiming to enhance video quality using methods like local, uni-,
bi-directional propagation, or traditional upscaling followed by restoration.
This challenge addresses VSR for conferencing, where LR videos are encoded with
H.265 at fixed QPs. The goal is to upscale videos by a specific factor,
providing HR outputs with enhanced perceptual quality under a low-delay
scenario using causal models. The challenge included three tracks:
general-purpose videos, talking head videos, and screen content videos, with
separate datasets provided by the organizers for training, validation, and
testing. We open-sourced a new screen content dataset for the SR task in this
challenge. Submissions were evaluated through subjective tests using a
crowdsourced implementation of the ITU-T Rec P.910.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate multi-class tubular modeling is critical for precise lesion
localization and optimal treatment planning. Deep learning methods enable
automated shape modeling by prioritizing volumetric overlap accuracy. However,
the inherent complexity of fine-grained semantic tubular shapes is not fully
emphasized by overlap accuracy, resulting in reduced topological preservation.
To address this, we propose the Shapeaware Sampling (SAS), which optimizes
patchsize allocation for online sampling and extracts a topology-preserved
skeletal representation for the objective function. Fractal Dimension-based
Patchsize (FDPS) is first introduced to quantify semantic tubular shape
complexity through axis-specific fractal dimension analysis. Axes with higher
fractal complexity are then sampled with smaller patchsizes to capture
fine-grained features and resolve structural intricacies. In addition, Minimum
Path-Cost Skeletonization (MPC-Skel) is employed to sample topologically
consistent skeletal representations of semantic tubular shapes for
skeleton-weighted objective functions. MPC-Skel reduces artifacts from
conventional skeletonization methods and directs the focus to critical
topological regions, enhancing tubular topology preservation. SAS is
computationally efficient and easily integrable into optimization pipelines.
Evaluation on two semantic tubular datasets showed consistent improvements in
both volumetric overlap and topological integrity metrics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR), particularly in combination with hash
encoding, has recently emerged as a promising approach for computed tomography
(CT) image reconstruction. However, directly applying INR techniques to 3D
dental cone-beam CT (CBCT) with a truncated field of view (FOV) is challenging.
During the training process, if the FOV does not fully encompass the patient's
head, a discrepancy arises between the measured projections and the forward
projections computed within the truncated domain. This mismatch leads the
network to estimate attenuation values inaccurately, producing severe artifacts
in the reconstructed images. In this study, we propose a computationally
efficient INR-based reconstruction framework that leverages multi-resolution
hash encoding for 3D dental CBCT with a truncated FOV. To mitigate truncation
artifacts, we train the network over an expanded reconstruction domain that
fully encompasses the patient's head. For computational efficiency, we adopt an
adaptive training strategy that uses a multi-resolution grid: finer resolution
levels and denser sampling inside the truncated FOV, and coarser resolution
levels with sparser sampling outside. To maintain consistent input
dimensionality of the network across spatially varying resolutions, we
introduce an adaptive hash encoder that selectively activates the lower-level
features of the hash hierarchy for points outside the truncated FOV. The
proposed method with an extended FOV effectively mitigates truncation
artifacts. Compared with a naive domain extension using fixed resolution levels
and a fixed sampling rate, the adaptive strategy reduces computational time by
over 60% for an image volume of 800x800x600, while preserving the PSNR within
the truncated FOV.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In recent years, the performance of lightweight Single-Image Super-Resolution
(SISR) has been improved significantly with the application of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and Large Kernel Attention (LKA). However, existing
information distillation modules for lightweight SISR struggle to map inputs
into High-Dimensional Non-Linear (HDNL) feature spaces, limiting their
representation learning. And their LKA modules possess restricted ability to
capture the multi-shape multi-scale information for long-range dependencies
while encountering a quadratic increase in the computational burden with
increasing convolutional kernel size of its depth-wise convolutional layer. To
address these issues, we firstly propose a Star Distillation Module (SDM) to
enhance the discriminative representation learning via information distillation
in the HDNL feature spaces. Besides, we present a Multi-shape Multi-scale Large
Kernel Attention (MM-LKA) module to learn representative long-range
dependencies while incurring low computational and memory footprints, leading
to improving the performance of CNN-based self-attention significantly.
Integrating SDM and MM-LKA, we develop a Residual Star Distillation Attention
Module (RSDAM) and take it as the building block of the proposed efficient Star
Distillation Attention Network (SDAN) which possesses high reconstruction
efficiency to recover a higher-quality image from the corresponding
low-resolution (LR) counterpart. When compared with other lightweight
state-of-the-art SISR methods, extensive experiments show that our SDAN with
low model complexity yields superior performance quantitatively and visually.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Zero-shot denoising aims to denoise observations without access to training
samples or clean reference images. This setting is particularly relevant in
practical imaging scenarios involving specialized domains such as medical
imaging or biology. In this work, we propose the Zero-Shot Neural Compression
Denoiser (ZS-NCD), a novel denoising framework based on neural compression.
ZS-NCD treats a neural compression network as an untrained model, optimized
directly on patches extracted from a single noisy image. The final
reconstruction is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of the trained model
over overlapping patches. Thanks to the built-in entropy constraints of
compression architectures, our method naturally avoids overfitting and does not
require manual regularization or early stopping. Through extensive experiments,
we show that ZS-NCD achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot
denoisers for both Gaussian and Poisson noise, and generalizes well to both
natural and non-natural images. Additionally, we provide new finite-sample
theoretical results that characterize upper bounds on the achievable
reconstruction error of general maximum-likelihood compression-based denoisers.
These results further establish the theoretical foundations of
compression-based denoising. Our code is available at:

Abstract: In this study, we propose a robust methodology for identification of myeloid
blasts followed by prediction of genetic mutation in single-cell images of
blasts, tackling challenges associated with label accuracy and data noise. We
trained an initial binary classifier to distinguish between leukemic (blasts)
and non-leukemic cells images, achieving 90 percent accuracy. To evaluate the
models generalization, we applied this model to a separate large unlabeled
dataset and validated the predictions with two haemato-pathologists, finding an
approximate error rate of 20 percent in the leukemic and non-leukemic labels.
Assuming this level of label noise, we further trained a four-class model on
images predicted as blasts to classify specific mutations. The mutation labels
were known for only a bag of cell images extracted from a single slide. Despite
the tumor label noise, our mutation classification model achieved 85 percent
accuracy across four mutation classes, demonstrating resilience to label
inconsistencies. This study highlights the capability of machine learning
models to work with noisy labels effectively while providing accurate,
clinically relevant mutation predictions, which is promising for diagnostic
applications in areas such as haemato-pathology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Dental diagnosis relies on two primary imaging modalities: panoramic
radiographs (PX) providing 2D oral cavity representations, and Cone-Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) offering detailed 3D anatomical information. While
PX images are cost-effective and accessible, their lack of depth information
limits diagnostic accuracy. CBCT addresses this but presents drawbacks
including higher costs, increased radiation exposure, and limited
accessibility. Existing reconstruction models further complicate the process by
requiring CBCT flattening or prior dental arch information, often unavailable
clinically. We introduce ViT-NeBLa, a vision transformer-based Neural
Beer-Lambert model enabling accurate 3D reconstruction directly from single PX.
Our key innovations include: (1) enhancing the NeBLa framework with Vision
Transformers for improved reconstruction capabilities without requiring CBCT
flattening or prior dental arch information, (2) implementing a novel
horseshoe-shaped point sampling strategy with non-intersecting rays that
eliminates intermediate density aggregation required by existing models due to
intersecting rays, reducing sampling point computations by $52 \%$, (3)
replacing CNN-based U-Net with a hybrid ViT-CNN architecture for superior
global and local feature extraction, and (4) implementing learnable hash
positional encoding for better higher-dimensional representation of 3D sample
points compared to existing Fourier-based dense positional encoding.
Experiments demonstrate that ViT-NeBLa significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, offering a
cost-effective, radiation-efficient alternative for enhanced dental
diagnostics.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), large neural networks pretrained on extensive and

significant promise in medical imaging by enabling robust performance with
limited labeled data. Although numerous surveys have reviewed the application
of FM in healthcare care, brain imaging remains underrepresented, despite its
critical role in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases using
modalities such as MRI, CT, and PET. Existing reviews either marginalize brain
imaging or lack depth on the unique challenges and requirements of FM in this
domain, such as multimodal data integration, support for diverse clinical
tasks, and handling of heterogeneous, fragmented datasets.
  To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive and curated review of
FMs for brain imaging. We systematically analyze 161 brain imaging datasets and
86 FM architectures, providing information on key design choices, training
paradigms, and optimizations driving recent advances. Our review highlights the
leading models for various brain imaging tasks, summarizes their innovations,
and critically examines current limitations and blind spots in the literature.
We conclude by outlining future research directions to advance FM applications
in brain imaging, with the aim of fostering progress in both clinical and

Abstract: Synthesizing high quality CT images remains a signifi-cant challenge due to
the limited availability of annotat-ed data and the complex nature of CT
imaging. In this work, we present PRO, a novel framework that, to the best of
our knowledge, is the first to perform CT image synthesis in the projection
domain using latent diffusion models. Unlike previous approaches that operate
in the image domain, PRO learns rich structural representa-tions from raw
projection data and leverages anatomi-cal text prompts for controllable
synthesis. This projec-tion domain strategy enables more faithful modeling of
underlying imaging physics and anatomical structures. Moreover, PRO functions
as a foundation model, capa-ble of generalizing across diverse downstream tasks
by adjusting its generative behavior via prompt inputs. Experimental results
demonstrated that incorporating our synthesized data significantly improves
perfor-mance across multiple downstream tasks, including low-dose and
sparse-view reconstruction, even with limited training data. These findings
underscore the versatility and scalability of PRO in data generation for
various CT applications. These results highlight the potential of projection

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Just like power, water and transportation systems, wireless networks are a
crucial societal infrastructure. As natural and human-induced disruptions
continue to grow, wireless networks must be resilient to unforeseen events,
able to withstand and recover from unexpected adverse conditions, shocks,
unmodeled disturbances and cascading failures. Despite its critical importance,
resilience remains an elusive concept, with its mathematical foundations still
underdeveloped. Unlike robustness and reliability, resilience is premised on
the fact that disruptions will inevitably happen. Resilience, in terms of
elasticity, focuses on the ability to bounce back to favorable states, while
resilience as plasticity involves agents (or networks) that can flexibly expand
their states, hypotheses and course of actions, by transforming through
real-time adaptation and reconfiguration. This constant situational awareness
and vigilance of adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about
potential system failures and the corresponding best responses, is a core
aspect of resilience. This article seeks to first define resilience and
disambiguate it from reliability and robustness, before delving into the
mathematics of resilience. Finally, the article concludes by presenting nuanced
metrics and discussing trade-offs tailored to the unique characteristics of
network resilience.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding how complex societal behaviors emerge from individual cognition
and interactions requires both high-fidelity modeling of human behavior and
large-scale simulations. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) have been
employed to study these dynamics for decades, but are constrained by simplified
agent behaviors that fail to capture human complexity. Recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities by enabling agents to exhibit
sophisticated social behaviors that go beyond rule-based logic, yet face
significant scaling challenges. Here we present Light Society, an agent-based
simulation framework that advances both fronts, efficiently modeling human-like
societies at planetary scale powered by LLMs. Light Society formalizes social
processes as structured transitions of agent and environment states, governed
by a set of LLM-powered simulation operations, and executed through an event
queue. This modular design supports both independent and joint component
optimization, supporting efficient simulation of societies with over one
billion agents. Large-scale simulations of trust games and opinion
propagation--spanning up to one billion agents--demonstrate Light Society's
high fidelity and efficiency in modeling social trust and information
diffusion, while revealing scaling laws whereby larger simulations yield more
stable and realistic emergent behaviors.

Conclusion: IndoorWorld offers a new platform for studying LLM agents in integrated physical-social scenarios, with applications in architectural design simulations.

Abstract: Virtual environments are essential to AI agent research. Existing
environments for LLM agent research typically focus on either physical task
solving or social simulation, with the former oversimplifying agent
individuality and social dynamics, and the latter lacking physical grounding of
social behaviors. We introduce IndoorWorld, a heterogeneous multi-agent
environment that tightly integrates physical and social dynamics. By
introducing novel challenges for LLM-driven agents in orchestrating social
dynamics to influence physical environments and anchoring social interactions
within world states, IndoorWorld opens up possibilities of LLM-based building
occupant simulation for architectural design. We demonstrate the potential with
a series of experiments within an office setting to examine the impact of
multi-agent collaboration, resource competition, and spatial layout on agent
behavior.

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems require connected and automated vehicles
(CAVs) to conduct safe and efficient cooperation with human-driven vehicles
(HVs) in complex real-world traffic environments. However, the inherent
unpredictability of human behaviour, especially at bottlenecks such as highway
on-ramp merging areas, often disrupts traffic flow and compromises system
performance. To address the challenge of cooperative on-ramp merging in
heterogeneous traffic environments, this study proposes a trust-based
multi-agent reinforcement learning (Trust-MARL) framework. At the macro level,
Trust-MARL enhances global traffic efficiency by leveraging inter-agent trust
to improve bottleneck throughput and mitigate traffic shockwave through
emergent group-level coordination. At the micro level, a dynamic trust
mechanism is designed to enable CAVs to adjust their cooperative strategies in
response to real-time behaviors and historical interactions with both HVs and
other CAVs. Furthermore, a trust-triggered game-theoretic decision-making
module is integrated to guide each CAV in adapting its cooperation factor and
executing context-aware lane-changing decisions under safety, comfort, and
efficiency constraints. An extensive set of ablation studies and comparative
experiments validates the effectiveness of the proposed Trust-MARL approach,
demonstrating significant improvements in safety, efficiency, comfort, and
adaptability across varying CAV penetration rates and traffic densities.
