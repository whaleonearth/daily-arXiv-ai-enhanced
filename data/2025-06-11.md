Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ
models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize
critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling
is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment
between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the
finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high
computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing
algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced
by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical
correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we
propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy
while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel
human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables
surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,
thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt
dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available
dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration
error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive
framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our
framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while
enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more
reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Although end-to-end autonomous driving has made remarkable progress, its
performance degrades significantly in rare and long-tail scenarios. Recent
approaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world
knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from
several limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data
of VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the
discrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation
learning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which
may be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an
autonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which
adopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a
large-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating
the domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving
scenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform
imitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to
continuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using
reinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model
to generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories. We evaluate our
approach on the planning-oriented NAVSIM benchmark, achieving a PDMS of 89.6
and setting a new state-of-the-art that surpasses the previous vision-only SOTA
by 5.6 PDMS.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Popular text-to-image (T2I) systems are trained on web-scraped data, which is
heavily Amero and Euro-centric, underrepresenting the cultures of the Global
South. To analyze these biases, we introduce CuRe, a novel and scalable
benchmarking and scoring suite for cultural representativeness that leverages
the marginal utility of attribute specification to T2I systems as a proxy for
human judgments. Our CuRe benchmark dataset has a novel categorical hierarchy
built from the crowdsourced Wikimedia knowledge graph, with 300 cultural
artifacts across 32 cultural subcategories grouped into six broad cultural axes
(food, art, fashion, architecture, celebrations, and people). Our dataset's
categorical hierarchy enables CuRe scorers to evaluate T2I systems by analyzing
their response to increasing the informativeness of text conditioning, enabling
fine-grained cultural comparisons. We empirically observe much stronger
correlations of our class of scorers to human judgments of perceptual
similarity, image-text alignment, and cultural diversity across image encoders
(SigLIP 2, AIMV2 and DINOv2), vision-language models (OpenCLIP, SigLIP 2,
Gemini 2.0 Flash) and state-of-the-art text-to-image systems, including three
variants of Stable Diffusion (1.5, XL, 3.5 Large), FLUX.1 [dev], Ideogram 2.0,
and DALL-E 3. The code and dataset is open-sourced and available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IGraSS, an iterative framework combining semantic segmentation and graph-based refinement to improve canal and road network mapping from remote sensing data, reducing errors and enhancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate canal network mapping is crucial for water management, but existing semantic segmentation models face challenges due to incomplete or inadequate ground truth data.

Method: IGraSS integrates a semantic segmentation module using RGB and other data modalities (NDWI, DEM) with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module that treats infrastructure networks as graphs.

Result: IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from 18% to 3% and improves canal identification when training with refined ground truth.

Conclusion: IGraSS provides a robust solution for refining noisy ground truth and mapping infrastructure networks, demonstrating effectiveness in both canals and roads with adaptable graph constraints.

Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including
irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic
segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large,
well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate
ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks
have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or
connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground
truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a
semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI,
DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module
processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on
the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show
that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and
training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification.
IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and
mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example,
applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

### [5] [Spectral Domain Neural Reconstruction for Passband FMCW Radars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08163)
*Harshvardhan Takawale,Nirupam Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpINRv2 is an improved neural framework for 3D radar imaging that handles high frequencies better, using a new frequency-domain model and some special techniques to make things clearer and more accurate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve 3D volumetric reconstruction using FMCW radar, especially when dealing with high start frequencies where traditional methods struggle with phase aliasing and sub-bin ambiguity.

Method: They developed a fully differentiable frequency-domain forward model that uses closed-form synthesis to capture radar responses, combined with an implicit neural representation for continuous scene modeling. They also added sparsity and smoothness regularization to handle sub-bin ambiguities.

Result: SpINRv2 performs much better than existing methods, particularly at high frequencies, and sets a new standard for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

Conclusion: SpINRv2 is a significant advancement in 3D radar imaging, effectively addressing challenges at high frequencies and offering a more efficient and accurate approach compared to previous methods.

Abstract: We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric
reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar.
Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that
allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and
sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully
differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar
response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural
representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike
time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency
spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to
disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions.
Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical
and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes,
establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training,
experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this
personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained,
surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion
framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method
formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task,
conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent
language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill.
Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts
using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual
behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on
the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture
sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon.
To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership
inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task
performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage.
These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve
performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing
the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical
modeling. Code is available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Scene-Graph Generation (SGG) seeks to recognize objects in an image and
distill their salient pairwise relationships. Most methods depend on
dataset-specific supervision to learn the variety of interactions, restricting
their usefulness in open-world settings, involving novel objects and/or
relations. Even methods that leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs)
typically require benchmark-specific fine-tuning. We introduce Open-World SGG,
a training-free, efficient, model-agnostic framework that taps directly into
the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to produce scene graphs with zero additional
learning. Casting SGG as a zero-shot structured-reasoning problem, our method
combines multimodal prompting, embedding alignment, and a lightweight
pair-refinement strategy, enabling inference over unseen object vocabularies
and relation sets. To assess this setting, we formalize an Open-World
evaluation protocol that measures performance when no SGG-specific data have
been observed either in terms of objects and relations. Experiments on Visual
Genome, Open Images V6, and the Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) dataset demonstrate
the capacity of pretrained VLMs to perform relational understanding without
task-level training.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study builds on the architecture of the Disentangler of Visual Priors
(DVP), a type of autoencoder that learns to interpret scenes by decomposing the
perceived objects into independent visual aspects of shape, size, orientation,
and color appearance. These aspects are expressed as latent parameters which
control a differentiable renderer that performs image reconstruction, so that
the model can be trained end-to-end with gradient using reconstruction loss. In
this study, we extend the original DVP so that it can handle multiple objects
in a scene. We also exploit the interpretability of its latent by using the
decoder to sample additional training examples and devising alternative
training modes that rely on loss functions defined not only in the image space,
but also in the latent space. This significantly facilitates training, which is
otherwise challenging due to the presence of extensive plateaus in the
image-space reconstruction loss. To examine the performance of this approach,
we propose a new benchmark featuring multiple 2D objects, which subsumes the
previously proposed Multi-dSprites dataset while being more parameterizable. We
compare the DVP extended in these ways with two baselines (MONet and LIVE) and
demonstrate its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality and capacity to
decompose overlapping objects. We also analyze the gradients induced by the
considered loss functions, explain how they impact the efficacy of training,
and discuss the limitations of differentiable rendering in autoencoders and the
ways in which they can be addressed.

Abstract: Monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs)
demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet their true
understanding of geometric properties remains unclear. We introduce GIQ , a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric
reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ
comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including
Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and
compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through
systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry
detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we
reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art
reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to
reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models
effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they
falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation,
such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit
remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting
basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is
publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address
critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in
robust, geometry-aware representation learning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made
significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the
somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we
investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text
encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training
and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of
different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12
different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could
impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract
embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal
that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to
inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and
find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly
improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning
outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced
visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a self-supervised model using deep clustering and negative sampling for segmenting radar satellite images into water and land areas without manual annotations, achieving a slight improvement in IoU with an ensemble approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of requiring large amounts of manually annotated satellite images for training, which are time-consuming and costly to produce.

Method: The method combines deep clustering and negative sampling to train a model for segmenting radar satellite images into water and land without manual annotations, and uses an ensemble version to reduce variance and improve performance.

Result: The ensemble of self-supervised models achieved a 0.02 improvement in the Intersection Over Union metric compared to a single fully-supervised model with the same architecture.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that self-supervised training methods can effectively segment radar satellite images without manual annotations, and ensemble approaches further enhance performance.

Abstract: In recent years the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite
images along with the advancement of computer vision models have enabled the
remote monitoring of the surface area of wetlands. However, these models
require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow
and expensive to produce. To overcome this problem, self-supervised training
methods have been deployed to train models without using annotated data. In
this paper we use a combination of deep clustering and negative sampling to
train a model to segment radar satellite images into areas that separate water
from land without the use of any manual annotations. Furthermore, we implement
an ensemble version of the model to reduce variance and improve performance.
Compared to a single fully-supervised model using the same architecture, our
ensemble of self-supervised models achieves a 0.02 improvement in the
Intersection Over Union metric over our test dataset.

*Octave Mariotti,Zhipeng Du,Yash Bhalgat,Oisin Mac Aodha,Hakan Bilen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for learning dense semantic correspondences by lifting 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using monocular depth estimation, without requiring explicit 3D supervision or camera annotations. They also introduce SPair-U, an extended dataset for better evaluation of generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent supervised semantic correspondence (SC) methods are limited in their ability to generalize beyond sparsely annotated training keypoints, acting more like keypoint detectors. There's a need for a method that can learn dense correspondences without explicit 3D supervision.

Method: The method involves lifting 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using monocular depth estimation. It constructs a continuous canonical manifold that captures object geometry without needing explicit 3D supervision or camera annotations.

Result: The model outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints, showing effectiveness in learning robust correspondences. Unsupervised baselines also outperform supervised ones when generalized across different datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively learns dense semantic correspondences without explicit 3D supervision, and the experiments show that unsupervised methods can be more effective when generalized across datasets.

Abstract: Semantic correspondence (SC) aims to establish semantically meaningful
matches across different instances of an object category. We illustrate how
recent supervised SC methods remain limited in their ability to generalize
beyond sparsely annotated training keypoints, effectively acting as keypoint
detectors. To address this, we propose a novel approach for learning dense
correspondences by lifting 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using
monocular depth estimation. Our method constructs a continuous canonical
manifold that captures object geometry without requiring explicit 3D
supervision or camera annotations. Additionally, we introduce SPair-U, an
extension of SPair-71k with novel keypoint annotations, to better assess
generalization. Experiments not only demonstrate that our model significantly
outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints, highlighting its
effectiveness in learning robust correspondences, but that unsupervised
baselines outperform supervised counterparts when generalized across different
datasets.

Motivation: To identify and address biases in existing vision-language benchmarks that may not accurately assess compositional understanding capabilities.

Method: Analyzing the design choices of 17 benchmarks, including data sources and curation procedures, and evaluating the performance of heuristics versus CLIP models.

Result: Found that blind heuristics perform on par with CLIP models, indicating benchmarks are not effective for measuring compositional understanding due to distribution asymmetry between positive and negative data.

Conclusion: The paper provides recommendations for creating more robust benchmarks to reduce vulnerabilities to simple attacks.

Abstract: We investigate 17 benchmarks (e.g. SugarCREPE, VALSE) commonly used for
measuring compositional understanding capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs). We scrutinize design choices in their construction, including data
source (e.g. MS-COCO) and curation procedures (e.g. constructing negative
images/captions), uncovering several inherent biases across most benchmarks. We
find that blind heuristics (e.g. token-length, log-likelihood under a language
model) perform on par with CLIP models, indicating that these benchmarks do not
effectively measure compositional understanding. We demonstrate that the
underlying factor is a distribution asymmetry between positive and negative
images/captions, induced by the benchmark construction procedures. To mitigate
these issues, we provide a few key recommendations for constructing more robust
vision-language compositional understanding benchmarks, that would be less
prone to such simple attacks.

TL;DR: This paper explores 1D image tokenizers, which compress images into short sequences, enabling image editing through token manipulation and generating images without training a generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the expressivity of 1D tokenizers' latent space for image generation and editing without needing to train a generative model.

Method: The method involves using gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss functions like reconstruction or CLIP similarity.

Result: The approach successfully demonstrates inpainting and text-guided image editing, generating diverse and realistic samples without training a generative model.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that 1D tokenizers with high compression allow for effective image editing and generation through heuristic token manipulation and optimization.

Abstract: Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged
tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly
compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find
that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector
quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through
heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude
manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent
representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring
appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D
tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging
gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss
functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is
demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can
generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any
generative model.

Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and
consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the
harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we
see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either
ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation
or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application
domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation
model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from
scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech
synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal
video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and
conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people
delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input
audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training
self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or
given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as
an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior
subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or
loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio
are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage
for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

Abstract: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic
computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the
inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for
computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized
attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention
within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses,
that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal
weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent
development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba
like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and
maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic
averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on
Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and
effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision
Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter

Motivation: Existing reflection removal techniques lack high-quality in-the-wild datasets, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Propose a new paradigm for collecting reflection datasets that is convenient, cost-effective, scalable, ensuring high-quality, aligned data pairs representing natural scenarios.

Result: OpenRR-1k dataset created with 1,000 high-quality image pairs, showing improved robustness when evaluated against several reflection removal methods.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset is effective in enhancing the robustness of reflection removal methods in real-world environments and is publicly available.

Abstract: Reflection removal technology plays a crucial role in photography and
computer vision applications. However, existing techniques are hindered by the
lack of high-quality in-the-wild datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel
paradigm for collecting reflection datasets from a fresh perspective. Our
approach is convenient, cost-effective, and scalable, while ensuring that the
collected data pairs are of high quality, perfectly aligned, and represent
natural and diverse scenarios. Following this paradigm, we collect a
Real-world, Diverse, and Pixel-aligned dataset (named OpenRR-1k dataset), which
contains 1,000 high-quality transmission-reflection image pairs collected in
the wild. Through the analysis of several reflection removal methods and
benchmark evaluation experiments on our dataset, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in improving robustness in challenging real-world environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image
classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground
objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification
overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract
and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image
(HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called
STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its
Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling
of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information
in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent
regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention
fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This
characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing
overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances
model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets,
outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

*Yuto Kase,Kai Ishibe,Ryoma Yasuda,Yudai Washida,Sakiko Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time method for detecting tennis ball impact on a racket using an event camera, which reduces memory usage and enables continuous performance monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of high-speed cameras in capturing prolonged scenes and manual digitization errors in determining ball impact positions, enabling better analysis of player performance.

Method: The method uses an event camera with three steps: identifying the swing time range, determining impact timing via PATS (polarity asymmetry in time symmetry), and detecting contours of the ball and racket using conventional computer vision and event-based processing.

Result: The experimental results showed accurate measurements within the permissible range for tennis performance analysis, with sufficient computation time for real-time applications.

Conclusion: The proposed event camera-based method effectively captures ball impact locations in real-time, overcoming memory and manual error issues, thus facilitating continuous performance monitoring and personalized equipment design.

Abstract: In racket sports, such as tennis, locating the ball's position at impact is
important in clarifying player and equipment characteristics, thereby aiding in
personalized equipment design. High-speed cameras are used to measure the
impact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged
scene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming
and prone to human error. These limitations make it difficult to effectively
capture the entire playing scene, hindering the ability to analyze the player's
performance. We propose a method for locating the tennis ball impact on the
racket in real time using an event camera. Event cameras efficiently measure
brightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed
motion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to
continuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method
consists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact,
and contours of ball and racket. Conventional computer vision techniques are
utilized along with an original event-based processing to detect the timing at
impact (PATS: the amount of polarity asymmetry in time symmetry). The results
of the experiments were within the permissible range for measuring tennis
players' performance. Moreover, the computation time was sufficiently short for
real-time applications.

### [20] [How Much To Guide: Revisiting Adaptive Guidance in Classifier-Free Guidance Text-to-Vision Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08351)
*Huixuan Zhang,Junzhe Zhang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Step AG, a simple and universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy for text-to-vision diffusion models, which reduces computation costs by restricting classifier-free guidance to the initial denoising steps, achieving 20-30% speedup without compromising image quality or image-text alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-free guidance in diffusion models is computationally expensive as it requires double the steps of unconditional generation. Previous adaptive guidance methods lack sufficient analysis and empirical validation, limiting their applicability to general diffusion models.

Method: The paper proposes Step AG, an adaptive guidance approach that applies classifier-free guidance only in the first few denoising steps, thereby reducing the overall number of steps needed while maintaining high-quality outputs and alignment with text conditions.

Result: Evaluations show that restricting classifier-free guidance to early denoising steps achieves high image quality and strong image-text alignment, with an average speedup of 20-30% across different models and inference settings.

Conclusion: Step AG provides a more efficient and broadly applicable method for adaptive guidance in diffusion models, demonstrating significant computational savings without sacrificing performance, making it a superior approach for various tasks including video generation.

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models,
classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for
conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps
for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in
significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of
adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making
previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work,
we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step
AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our
evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results
indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several
denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned
images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is
consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various
models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our
method.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Different medical imaging modalities capture diagnostic information at
varying spatial resolutions, from coarse global patterns to fine-grained
localized structures. However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the
medical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction,
overlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a
modular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically
adapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE
incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type,
which routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches
trained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate
over feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling
spatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework
produces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions,
without requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results
on diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and
retrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of
modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language
systems.

Abstract: When shooting electronic screens, moir\'e patterns usually appear in captured
images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoir\'eing
methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moir\'e. To address
the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoir\'eing
(DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moir\'e
removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the
two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image
generally can provide normal colors and textures when moir\'e exists in the W
image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an
efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into
an existing demoir\'eing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is
present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse
mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the
dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/Mrduckk/DCID.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the

that enables VLMs to effectively leverage multi-scale visual information with
an object-centric manner, closely aligning with human visual perception. SECOND
progressively selects and integrates multi-scale visual information,
facilitating a more precise interpretation of images. By contrasting these
visual information iteratively, SECOND significantly reduces perceptual
hallucinations and outperforms a wide range of benchmarks. Our theoretical
analysis and experiments highlight the largely unexplored potential of
multi-scale application in VLMs, showing that prioritizing and contrasting
across scales outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources
within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference
mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a
limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While
existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse
samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the
radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the
sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further
incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization
sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing
compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network
(RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter
adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio
propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to
adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by
the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate
obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic
decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor
prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the
performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: The application of visual instruction tuning and other post-training
techniques has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in visual understanding, enriching Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with
more comprehensive visual language datasets. However, the effectiveness of VLMs
is highly dependent on large-scale, high-quality datasets that ensure precise
recognition and accurate reasoning. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1)
noisy alignments between images and the corresponding text, which leads to
misinterpretation, and (2) ambiguous or misleading text, which obscures visual
content. To address these challenges, we propose SCALE (Single modality data
quality and Cross modality Alignment Evaluation), a novel quality-driven data
selection pipeline for VLM instruction tuning datasets. Specifically, SCALE
integrates a cross-modality assessment framework that first assigns each data
entry to its appropriate vision-language task, generates general and
task-specific captions (covering scenes, objects, style, etc.), and evaluates
the alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each
entry based on the generated captions. We reveal that: (1) current unimodal
quality assessment methods evaluate one modality while overlooking the rest,
which can underestimate samples essential for specific tasks and discard the
lower-quality instances that help build model robustness; and (2) appropriately
generated image captions provide an efficient way to transfer the image-text
multimodal task into a unified text modality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
producing high-quality, dynamic videos. To improve the visual controllability,
recent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support
image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses
motion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared
to their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and
identify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in
the input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory
that overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this,
we propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model
sampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising
per-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency
content of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early
stage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly
improves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image
fidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG
achieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant
drop in video quality or image fidelity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities
such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm
in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an
object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved
sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of
hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using
NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or
surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned
from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling
transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a
self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient
datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features
from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the
unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts
full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of
500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature
transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in
comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.

Abstract: Most research efforts in the multimedia forensics domain have focused on
detecting forgery audio-visual content and reached sound achievements. However,
these works only consider deepfake detection as a classification task and
ignore the case where partial segments of the video are tampered with. Temporal
forgery localization (TFL) of small fake audio-visual clips embedded in real
videos is still challenging and more in line with realistic application
scenarios. To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware
contrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages
supervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by
means of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal
forged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer
that utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context
updater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the
discriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine
instant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An
efficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the
limit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants
in a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence
to improve temporal forgery localization performance. Extensive experimental
results over five public datasets demonstrate that our proposed UniCaCLF
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips

task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer
from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key
modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba
blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and
extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner
leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM)
to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without
fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured
state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more
precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and
TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and
significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Motivation: Visual localization is challenging in dynamic environments due to factors like lighting changes, weather, and moving objects that disrupt appearance cues. Current methods struggle with consistency under varying conditions.

Semantic supervision via neural scene representation is used during training to learn view-invariant features.

Result: Experiments on TartanAir show the approach outperforms existing methods in scenarios with dynamic objects, illumination changes, and occlusions.

Conclusion: Integrating multi-scale processing with semantic guidance is a promising strategy for robust visual localization in real-world dynamic environments.

Abstract: Visual localization remains challenging in dynamic environments where
fluctuating lighting, adverse weather, and moving objects disrupt appearance

regression methods struggle to maintain consistency under varying conditions.
To address this challenge, we propose a framework that synergistically combines
multi-scale feature learning with semantic scene understanding. Our approach
employs a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention to fuse geometric

semantic supervision via neural scene representation during training, guiding
the network to learn view-invariant features that encode persistent structural

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by
enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal
modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually
suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational
costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for
long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that
leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$,
achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To
balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal
modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary
components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal
modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii)
Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments
($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token
flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame
contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment
information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal
overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we
introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches
arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on
several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves
impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and

TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that
addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative
trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that
employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse
outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single
pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence
across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the
Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted
trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique
that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a
second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating
inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical
autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance AI transparency and control by focusing on high-level, human-interpretable representations rather than individual neurons or circuits, building on the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH).

Method: The method involves proposing ISLH, introducing SPP as a framework to formalize the progression of linear representations along dominant spectral directions, and demonstrating multimodal robustness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Result: The result is the SPP framework, which shows that deep networks distill linear representations along dominant spectral directions, and these representations are robust across modalities in VLMs.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that this work advances a structured theory of representation formation in deep networks, contributing to better AI robustness, fairness, and transparency.

Abstract: High-level representations have become a central focus in enhancing AI
transparency and control, shifting attention from individual neurons or
circuits to structured semantic directions that align with human-interpretable
concepts. Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose
the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned
directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with
increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP)
framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear
representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on
this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these
representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical
insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of
representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI
robustness, fairness, and transparency.

challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode
placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on
subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach
that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world
deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration
requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject
generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network
that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification
by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific
components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern
recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific
components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric
identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various
baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new
perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration
and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as
task-independent biometric systems.

Abstract: Recently, object detection models have witnessed notable performance
improvements, particularly with transformer-based models. However, new objects
frequently appear in the real world, requiring detection models to continually
learn without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Although Incremental
Object Detection (IOD) has emerged to address this challenge, these existing
models are still not practical due to their limited performance and prolonged
inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for IOD, called
Hier-DETR: Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer, ensuring both
efficiency and competitive performance by leveraging Neural Collapse for
imbalance dataset and Hierarchical relation of classes' labels.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables intelligent agents to navigate
environments by integrating visual perception and natural language
instructions, yet faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of
fine-grained cross-modal alignment annotations. Existing datasets primarily
focus on global instruction-trajectory matching, neglecting
sub-instruction-level and entity-level alignments critical for accurate
navigation action decision-making. To address this limitation, we propose
FCA-NIG, a generative framework that automatically constructs navigation
instructions with dual-level fine-grained cross-modal annotations. In this
framework, an augmented trajectory is first divided into sub-trajectories,
which are then processed through GLIP-based landmark detection, crafted
instruction construction, OFA-Speaker based R2R-like instruction generation,
and CLIP-powered entity selection, generating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs
with entity-landmark annotations. Finally, these sub-pairs are aggregated to
form a complete instruction-trajectory pair. The framework generates the
FCA-R2R dataset, the first large-scale augmentation dataset featuring precise
sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that training with FCA-R2R significantly improves the
performance of multiple state-of-the-art VLN agents, including SF, EnvDrop,
RecBERT, and HAMT. Incorporating sub-instruction-trajectory alignment enhances
agents' state awareness and decision accuracy, while entity-landmark alignment
further boosts navigation performance and generalization. These results
highlight the effectiveness of FCA-NIG in generating high-quality, scalable
training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal
learning in complex navigation tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance
is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model
parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze
popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the
recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP
Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision
transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we
conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons
of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance
recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our
pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large
vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original
performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision
transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter
and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B),
our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without
performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at

Abstract: Transformers have become the architecture of choice for learning long-range

emerging. We reviewed more than 300 papers published up to 2025 and present the
first end-to-end survey dedicated to Transformer-based HSI classification. The
study categorizes every stage of a typical pipeline-pre-processing, patch or
pixel tokenization, positional encoding, spatial-spectral feature extraction,
multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and
contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral
properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles:
scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead,
and limited model explainability. Finally, we outline a research agenda
prioritizing valuable public data sets, lightweight on-edge models,
illumination and sensor shifts robustness, and intrinsically interpretable
attention mechanisms. Our goal is to guide researchers in selecting, combining,
or extending Transformer components that are truly fit for purpose for
next-generation HSI applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is widely recognized as an effective approach to
enhance the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. As a variant of AT,
Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has shown outstanding performance in
enhancing the robustness of small models. However, both AT and ARD face robust
fairness issue: these models tend to display strong adversarial robustness
against some classes (easy classes) while demonstrating weak adversarial
robustness against others (hard classes). This paper explores the underlying
factors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for
different classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical
observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we
propose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge
Distillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness.
Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between
different classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness
degree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment
is managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes.
Additionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be
integrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate
ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of
robustness and fairness.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of training deep learning models in data-deficient scenarios, where traditional methods struggle due to lack of sufficient data.

Method: The method involves organizing workshops with data-impaired challenges, encouraging participants to develop approaches that incorporate prior knowledge without using transfer learning.

Result: The result shows that successful entries use large model ensembles combining Transformers and CNNs, along with heavy data augmentation, to enhance data efficiency.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that integrating prior knowledge through ensembles and augmentation techniques can significantly improve deep learning performance in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Deep Learning requires large amounts of data to train models that work well.
In data-deficient settings, performance can be degraded. We investigate which
Deep Learning methods benefit training models in a data-deficient setting, by
organizing the "VIPriors: Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep
Learning" workshop series, featuring four editions of data-impaired challenges.
These challenges address the problem of training deep learning models for
computer vision tasks with limited data. Participants are limited to training
models from scratch using a low number of training samples and are not allowed
to use any form of transfer learning. We aim to stimulate the development of
novel approaches that incorporate prior knowledge to improve the data
efficiency of deep learning models. Successful challenge entries make use of
large model ensembles that mix Transformers and CNNs, as well as heavy data
augmentation. Novel prior knowledge-based methods contribute to success in some

Abstract: This work proposes SAMSelect, an algorithm to obtain a salient three-channel
visualization for multispectral images. We develop SAMSelect and show its use
for marine scientists visually interpreting floating marine debris in
Sentinel-2 imagery. These debris are notoriously difficult to visualize due to
their compositional heterogeneity in medium-resolution imagery. Out of these
difficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains
a common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a
case-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect
selects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification
accuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model. Its
central assumption is that the three-channel visualization achieves the most
accurate segmentation results also provide good visual information for
photo-interpretation.
  We evaluate SAMSelect in three Sentinel-2 scenes containing generic marine
debris in Accra, Ghana, and Durban, South Africa, and deployed plastic targets
from the Plastic Litter Project. This reveals the potential of new previously
unused band combinations (e.g., a normalized difference index of B8, B2), which
demonstrate improved performance compared to literature-based indices. We
describe the algorithm in this paper and provide an open-source code repository
that will be helpful for domain scientists doing visual photo interpretation,
especially in the marine field.

Abstract: Several variants of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have significantly
improved the accuracy of synthesized images and surface reconstruction of 3D
scenes/objects. In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can
train the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every
pixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability
issues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D
points along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the
sampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage
the implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a
probability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more
targeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved
rendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for
improved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image
projection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space
components. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into
current state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more
accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering,
especially for the regions of interest in any given scene.

Abstract: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers

modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision
tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper,
we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation,

Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to
improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale
Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial
aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion
Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented
accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that
the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6%
mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M
parameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis

to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform
generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic
arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike
previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same
environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired
data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap
introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion
models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic
arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one
robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video
background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion
realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained
independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms
state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of
both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust
solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

Abstract: We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for
unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. Recent learning
methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that
allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized
representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but
lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation
for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum
resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the
state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key
contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to
classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed
up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to
use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel
multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise
levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can
provide improved reconstruction results.

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive object shape and orientation from a single image,

models often produce misaligned results due to inconsistent training data,
limiting their usability in downstream tasks. To address this gap, we introduce
the task of orientation-aligned 3D object generation: producing 3D objects from
single images with consistent orientations across categories. To facilitate
this, we construct Objaverse-OA, a dataset of 14,832 orientation-aligned 3D
models spanning 1,008 categories. Leveraging Objaverse-OA, we fine-tune two
representative 3D generative models based on multi-view diffusion and 3D
variational autoencoder frameworks to produce aligned objects that generalize
well to unseen objects across various categories. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our method over post-hoc alignment approaches.
Furthermore, we showcase downstream applications enabled by our aligned object
generation, including zero-shot object orientation estimation via
analysis-by-synthesis and efficient arrow-based object rotation manipulation.

Abstract: Video memorability refers to the ability of videos to be recalled after
viewing, playing a crucial role in creating content that remains memorable.
Existing models typically focus on extracting multimodal features to predict
video memorability scores but often fail to fully utilize motion cues. The
representation of motion features is compromised during the fine-tuning phase
of the motion feature extractor due to a lack of labeled data. In this paper,
we introduce the Text-Motion Cross-modal Contrastive Loss (TMCCL), a multimodal
video memorability prediction model designed to enhance the representation of
motion features. We tackle the challenge of improving motion feature
representation by leveraging text description similarities across videos to
establish positive and negative motion sample sets for a given target. This
enhancement allows the model to learn similar feature representations for
semantically related motion content, resulting in more accurate memorability
predictions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video
memorability prediction datasets. Moreover, the potential applications of video
memorability prediction have been underexplored. To address this gap, we
present Memorability Weighted Correction for Video Summarization (MWCVS), using
video memorability prediction to reduce subjectivity in video summarization
labels. Experimental results on two video summarization datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of MWCVS, showcasing the promising applications of video
memorability prediction.

Abstract: Multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5 achieve state-of-the-art visual
understanding through visual instruction tuning on multitask datasets, enabling
strong instruction-following and multimodal performance. However, multitask
learning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment
of data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic
forgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising
alternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing
capabilities. However, current methods prioritize task-specific performance,
neglecting base model degradation from overfitting to specific instructions,
which undermines general capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple but
effective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware
consolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization
to prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific
performance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments
demonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance
and preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that
task-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass
multitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary
dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual
concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level
understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We
identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic
coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation
methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic
coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To
overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel
approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained
alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation
levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal
self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders,
preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail
recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation
benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline
CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and
underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and
fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.

Abstract: Canada experienced in 2023 one of the most severe wildfire seasons in recent
history, causing damage across ecosystems, destroying communities, and emitting
large quantities of CO2. This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a
climate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season
that affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower
wildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions.
Wildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the
likelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future
wildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data
has enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models,
aiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and
temporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on
coarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to
wildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\sim
0.1${\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and
baseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada,
leveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite
images (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and
environmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two
major deep learning architectures. We observe that using multi-modal temporal
inputs outperforms single-modal temporal inputs across all metrics, achieving a
peak performance of 60.3% in F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, a season
never seen during model training. This demonstrates the potential of
multi-modal deep learning models for wildfire forecasting at high-resolution
and continental scale.

Abstract: Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel-

point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By

optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster
assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views
despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory
signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames,
improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By
initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for
training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video
datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly

Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a
challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition
large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using
Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view
rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not
generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques
struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions
results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these
challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable
high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a
spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which
incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures
and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate
artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its
superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight
its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86
dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to
state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient
encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding
language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene
understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three
main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene
optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are
evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close
to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D
understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark
that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D
space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor
dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable
paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast
feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation
performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS
dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from
multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could
harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made
public to accelerate research in generalizable 3DGS scene understanding.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the
abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current
clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA
diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet
these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on
the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the
complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized
intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve
monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model
to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with
local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have
parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular
surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using
a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24
AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model
predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of
1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a
patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93).
Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set
consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our
results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular
surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InceptionNeXt's limited spatial dependency capture and local neighborhood modeling, along with convolution's locality constraints, hinder effective global context modeling.

Method: Replace one-dimensional strip convolutions with orthogonal band convolutions and incorporate a bottleneck Mamba module for global context modeling.

Result: InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with higher parameter and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: InceptionMamba addresses spatial modeling limitations and enhances global context understanding, showing superior efficiency and performance in image classification and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown
excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream
tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it
suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different
dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood.
Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are
detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in
this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip
convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba
to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling
can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced
cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive
evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the
proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior
parameter and computational efficiency. The source code will be available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various
applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale,
high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and
time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a
promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS
methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited
labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization.
We propose that Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on vast and
diverse datasets, possess robust generalization capabilities that can
effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for
SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and
Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge
embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing.
Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and
CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student
features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative
power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder.
Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS
Potsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing
approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in
the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of
multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and
semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of each proposed module.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a
cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from
large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often
incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D
images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This
strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model
to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches
are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory
demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in
2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL
framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the
computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct
3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the
backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training
strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D
and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with
reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric
locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process
reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection
tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a task that distinguishes normal and abnormal data,
which is important for applying automation technologies of the manufacturing
facilities. For MVTec dataset that is a representative AD dataset for
industrial environment, many recent works have shown remarkable performances.
However, the existing anomaly detection works have a limitation of showing good
performance for fully-aligned datasets only, unlike real-world industrial
environments. To solve this limitation, we propose HomographyAD, a novel deep
anomaly detection methodology based on the ImageNet-pretrained network, which
is specially designed for actual industrial dataset. Specifically, we first
suggest input foreground alignment using the deep homography estimation method.
In addition, we fine-tune the model by self homography learning to learn
additional shape information from normal samples. Finally, we conduct anomaly
detection based on the measure of how far the feature of test sample is from
the distribution of the extracted normal features. By applying our proposed
method to various existing AD approaches, we show performance enhancement
through extensive experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an effective and generalized dehazing method that can be integrated into deep learning models.

Method: The method uses a PDE combining atmospheric scattering, nonlocal regularization, and dark channel prior, with specific terms like D(∇u) and λ(t) for adaptive regularization.

Result: The method shows promising dehazing results and can be generalized to deep model paradigms.

Conclusion: The proposed PDE framework is a viable solution for single-image dehazing, offering potential for integration with deep learning approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for
single-image dehazing. By integrating the atmospheric scattering model with
nonlocal regularization and dark channel prior, we propose the improved PDE: \[
-\text{div}\left(D(\nabla u)\nabla u\right) + \lambda(t) G(u) = \Phi(I,t,A) \]
where $D(\nabla u) = (|\nabla u| + \epsilon)^{-1}$ is the edge-preserving
diffusion coefficient, $G(u)$ is the Gaussian convolution operator, and
$\lambda(t)$ is the adaptive regularization parameter based on transmission map
$t$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $H_0^1(\Omega)$
using Lax-Milgram theorem, and implement an efficient fixed-point iteration
scheme accelerated by PyTorch GPU computation. The experimental results
demonstrate that this method is a promising deghazing solution that can be
generalized to the deep model paradigm.

Abstract: Recently, the rectified flow (RF) has emerged as the new state-of-the-art
among flow-based diffusion models due to its high efficiency advantage in
straight path sampling, especially with the amazing images generated by a
series of RF models such as Flux 1.0 and SD 3.0. Although a straight-line
connection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast,
and easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns,
which arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling
space. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow
only needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\bm v$ between the two
distributions $\bm\pi_0$ and $\bm\pi_1$. In this work, we present
Discretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow
models since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random
velocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path
into a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'')
to expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution
$p_\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly
superimposed on $\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\bm v$ of the
sub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and
multi-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several
representative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by
sampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse
and efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.

Abstract: To address key limitations in human-object interaction (HOI) video generation

HunyuanVideo-HOMA enhances controllability and reduces dependency on precise

integrate a parameter-space HOI adapter initialized from pretrained MMDiT
weights, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient adaptation, and a
facial cross-attention adapter for anatomically accurate audio-driven lip
synchronization. Extensive experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance in

TL;DR: The paper proposes HiSin, a diffusion-based framework for efficient high-resolution sinogram inpainting in CT scans by using progressive inference and optimized computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is crucial for CT reconstruction to avoid artifacts and diagnostic errors, but diffusion models face memory and computational challenges.

Method: HiSin uses resolution-guided progressive inference, starting with global structure at low resolution and then focusing on small patches for high-resolution details. It includes frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to cut down on redundant computation.

Result: HiSin reduces peak memory usage by 31.25% and inference time by 18.15% while maintaining accurate inpainting across different datasets, resolutions, and mask conditions.

Conclusion: HiSin effectively addresses the limitations of diffusion models in high-resolution sinogram inpainting, offering a memory-efficient and faster solution without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography
reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible
artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task
due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their
application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and
computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel
diffusion based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting via
resolution-guided progressive inference. It progressively extracts global
structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small
patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. It further incorporates
frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce
redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory
usage by up to 31.25% and inference time by up to 18.15%, and maintains
inpainting accuracy across datasets, resolutions, and mask conditions.

systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with
respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this
end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human
evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10
countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts,
3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over
10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet
the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging
explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are
missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit
expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while
implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human
judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning.
Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable
directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation
methodologies.

Abstract: Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining

employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the
internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of
interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and

Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer

these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language

vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text

approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two
tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our
method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation
models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing
state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models. The source code of

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels
at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis

inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3)
maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we
introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms
uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering
scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical
innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS
position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic
decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive
experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat
consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic
scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily
long video streams. Code and models are available at

Abstract: The parameter-efficient adaptation of the image-text pretraining model CLIP
for video-text retrieval is a prominent area of research. While CLIP is focused
on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands
comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge
in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and
alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting
language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in
Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all
three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to
integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both
vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image
captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment
discrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which
leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In
particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous
methods by 1.5% in R@1, reaching a final score of 50.5% R@1. The code is

Motivation: The motivation is to integrate diverse knowledge from multiple sources in shared data domains like images and videos, which remains under-explored despite modern neural models capturing rich priors.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the PoE framework with AIS provides an effective way to compose knowledge from various models, enhancing controllability and user interaction in visual generation tasks.

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge
over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse
knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual
language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics
engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product
of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition
from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product
distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our
framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding
better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing
flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab
environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in
ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual
performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often
subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising
avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and
objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic
surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or
isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in
controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat,
the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for
automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of
surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive
phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures.
These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment
during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to
standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these
essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven
evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a
strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets
a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in
ophthalmology training. The dataset and annotations are publicly available in

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting
clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography
(OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and
existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation
models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown
promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for
ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and
focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel
multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO)
images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO
classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and
specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in
both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the
development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Feature augmentation generates novel samples in the feature space, providing
an effective way to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms
with hyperbolic geometry. Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to
closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen
classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we
propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment,
which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic
space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for
efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation
module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both
seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the
latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also
derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to
train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen
classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks:
class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning,
zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our
method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in
open-environment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that
high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute
disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational
redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In
this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and
identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional
branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic
step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to
improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the
information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal.
Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a
technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost.
Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies
significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR,
a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically
select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate
the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark
datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments
show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall
acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model
quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware,
training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage attention-based method with learned binary masks to enhance object perception by focusing on relevant regions and filtering out spurious context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Context can bias object perception, especially in out-of-distribution backgrounds, but object-centric tasks often need context. The challenge is balancing context's role without causing bias.

Method: Two-stage framework: first stage processes full image to find object parts and relevant regions; second stage uses attention masks to focus on these regions, with joint training allowing refinement.

Result: Experiments show improved robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances context usage and reduces bias by focusing on relevant image regions through attentive masking.

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention
masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction.
Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased
representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution
backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require
identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this
conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image
to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2
leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these
regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious
information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage
1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and
out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Abstract: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the
possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought
reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via
distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning
models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply
abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden
knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training
or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer
pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a
search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader
inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented
knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We
evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent
improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on
MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

Abstract: In the era of information explosion, efficiently leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data while minimizing the reliance on high-quality pixel-level
annotations remains a critical challenge in the field of medical imaging.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enhances the utilization of unlabeled data by
facilitating knowledge transfer, significantly improving the performance of
fully supervised models and emerging as a highly promising research direction
in medical image analysis. Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models
(e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised
SAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction
capabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus
effectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image
segmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream "weak-to-strong"
consistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative
Feature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature
discrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across
multiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across
multi-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the
features, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a
prompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a
Sliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data,
fulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical
image segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably,
SSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice. Code will be available at

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a
wide range of biometric tasks, including face and body recognition. In this
work, we adapt a ViT model pretrained on visible (VIS) imagery to the
challenging problem of cross-spectral body recognition, which involves matching
images captured in the visible and infrared (IR) domains. Recent ViT
architectures have explored incorporating additional embeddings beyond
traditional positional embeddings. Building on this idea, we integrate Side
Information Embedding (SIE) and examine the impact of encoding domain and
camera information to enhance cross-spectral matching. Surprisingly, our
results show that encoding only camera information - without explicitly
incorporating domain information - achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
LLCM dataset. While occlusion handling has been extensively studied in
visible-spectrum person re-identification (Re-ID), occlusions in
visible-infrared (VI) Re-ID remain largely underexplored - primarily because
existing VI-ReID datasets, such as LLCM, SYSU-MM01, and RegDB, predominantly
feature full-body, unoccluded images. To address this gap, we analyze the
impact of range-induced occlusions using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain
Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which provides a diverse set of visible and infrared
images captured at various distances, enabling cross-range, cross-spectral

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves
segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments,
utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for
model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited
supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the
difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which
arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To
tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher
framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment
Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced
by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality
segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label
generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce
informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select
the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring
robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic
similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups
features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering
similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating
more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images.
We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing
the performance of existing models.

Abstract: Object compositing, the task of placing and harmonizing objects in images of

ORIDa (Object-centric Real-world Image Composition Dataset), a large-scale,
real-captured dataset containing over 30,000 images featuring 200 unique

has two types of data: factual-counterfactual sets and factual-only scenes. The
factual-counterfactual sets consist of four factual images showing an object in
different positions within a scene and a single counterfactual (or background)
image of the scene without the object, resulting in five images per scene. The
factual-only scenes include a single image containing an object in a specific
context, expanding the variety of environments. To our knowledge, ORIDa is the
first publicly available dataset with its scale and complexity for real-world
image composition. Extensive analysis and experiments highlight the value of
ORIDa as a resource for advancing further research in object compositing.

Abstract: Object detection models typically rely on predefined categories, limiting
their ability to identify novel objects in open-world scenarios. To overcome

a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM
leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown
objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene.
These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an
Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category
supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually
similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and
cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance
consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository
labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority
re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate
that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and
contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

Abstract: LiDAR segmentation has emerged as an important task to enrich multimedia

to their high computational efficiency and compatibility with real-time
deployment. However, their generalized performance under adverse weather
conditions remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world
environments. In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that
affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather.
To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework
that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing
models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view
networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance
intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS)
module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a
Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance
distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The
processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation
pipeline. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks and baseline models
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization to adverse
weather with minimal inference overhead, offering a practical and effective
solution for real-world LiDAR segmentation.

Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning
shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and
zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive
learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation
capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language
alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked
modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual
representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through
Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes
only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the
computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves
superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and
zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked
record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph
inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their
corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language
alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the
best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image
accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval
accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment
also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly

Abstract: Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models,
have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid
generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted
content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept
replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to
"erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have
started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt
as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are
known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model
to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact
erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in
emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted
concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy
between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing
unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs
to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected
fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of
targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity.
We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information
to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but
their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.
This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which
generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are
inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To
overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches
have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are
significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map
construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD
maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach
introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we
incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but
additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this
way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the
dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,
we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element
identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on
Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up
to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP
(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors. Code is

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational
pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings
from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly
supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and
conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address
data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of
pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for
morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that
pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target
task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover,
pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs
and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less
pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL
models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost
performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the
implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on
popular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains
such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen
during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent
unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit
from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test
samples and the training data distribution to identify differences.
State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data
after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally
stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This
is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible
due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy
constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework
that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the
training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose
Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of
training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only
model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and
deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target
sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on
four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,
histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against
existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD
detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers
could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of
their training data for OOD detection services. Code will be available upon

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning by improving diffusion models with a simple regularizer.

Method: Dispersive Loss is a plug-and-play regularizer that encourages dispersion of internal representations in the hidden space, similar to contrastive self-supervised learning but without requiring positive sample pairs.

Result: Evaluated on ImageNet, Dispersive Loss shows consistent improvements over strong baselines in various models.

Conclusion: The authors hope that Dispersive Loss will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has
largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These
diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally
lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive
Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves
diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal
representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive
self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive
sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used
for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment
(REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no
pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate
Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report
consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work
will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation
learning.

collect indoor, outdoor, and object scanning videos with synchronized monocular

scale-aware evaluation metric for SLAM based on the the optical flow induced by
the camera pose estimation error. In contrast to the current metrics, our new
metric allows for comparison between the performance of SLAM methods across
scenes as opposed to existing metrics such as Average Trajectory Error (ATE),
allowing researchers to analyze the failure modes of their methods. We also

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision
solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality
into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an
inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that
captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain
vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,
current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially
overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have
explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive
visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),
which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified
autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw
visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal
understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic
representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find
that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can
effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and
consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding
benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying
data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves
LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is

especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role
in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we

Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation
model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity,
multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We
showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale
the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and
challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data
helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization
in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving
policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights
through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on
uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse
cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with
curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific
overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a
unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts.
Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases
monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several
steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache)
that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism
and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of
curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for
calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x
speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior
visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM,
and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.

Result: Evaluated on three datasets, TIP-Search shows up to 8.5% higher accuracy and 100% deadline compliance than static models.

Conclusion: TIP-Search is effective for robust, low-latency financial inference under uncertain conditions, offering a dynamic approach to model selection.

Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling

Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then
performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain

(FI-2010, Binance BTC/USDT, LOBSTER AAPL) and demonstrate that it outperforms
static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline

Abstract: The emergence of capable large language model (LLM) based agents necessitates
memory architectures that transcend mere data storage, enabling continuous
learning, nuanced reasoning, and dynamic adaptation. Current memory systems
often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal
awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw
interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory
framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph
(STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles
(IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and
situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs
are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving
knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive
refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of
insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived
from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental
results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing
approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering
scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable
34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean
query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this
paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory
systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines
promising future research trajectories.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general-purpose reasoning
and problem-solving abilities. However, they struggle with executing complex,
long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation.
Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the
complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we
present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data
generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously
test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents.
Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800
tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and
human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent
architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing
average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the
tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools
nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between
current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world
SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the
need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before
deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at
http://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. We also release the
prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new
domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench
with SOPs from their industrial domains.

Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML),

to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite
capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality,
consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted
peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We
advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated
collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose
specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer
performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in
decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems
hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer
review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative
experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss
significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to
proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and
scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer

Motivation: The motivation is to handle quantitative temporal constraints in ASP, such as durations and deadlines, while maintaining scalability despite the challenges posed by fine-grained timing.

Method: The method involves extending ASP with difference constraints, which are a simplified form of linear constraints, to manage time-related aspects externally, thereby decoupling metric ASP from time granularity.

Result: The approach allows for expressing quantitative temporal constraints without being affected by time precision, effectively addressing the scalability issue in ASP's grounding process.

Conclusion: By using difference constraints to handle time externally, the paper presents a solution that decouples metric ASP from time granularity, enhancing scalability and managing temporal constraints efficiently.

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to
allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and

Abstract: The site conditions that make astronomical observatories in space and on the

to limited data transmission capabilities. Such transmission limitations
directly bottleneck the amount of data acquired and in an era of costly modern
observatories, any improvements in lossless data compression has the potential
scale to billions of dollars worth of additional science that can be
accomplished on the same instrument. Traditional lossless methods for
compressing astrophysical data are manually designed. Neural data compression,
on the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms
end-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the
unique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images.
This paper introduces AstroCompress: a neural compression challenge for
astrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with
16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based,
ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to
easily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods (three
neural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art
algorithms). Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural
compression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and
provide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific
applications. Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless
compression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression
methods in future studies.

modules: (i) an autoformalizer/proof-checker, (ii) a next-step generator, and
(iii) a natural language feedback generator. The first module faithfully
autoformalizes student proofs into Lean and verifies proof accuracy via
successful code compilation. If the proof has an error, the incorrect step is
identified. The next-step generator module outputs a valid next Lean tactic for
incorrect proofs via LLM-based candidate generation and proof search. The
feedback generator module leverages Lean data to produce a
pedagogically-motivated natural language hint for the student user. To evaluate
our system, we introduce PeanoBench, a human-written dataset derived from the
Natural Numbers Game, consisting of 371 Peano Arithmetic proofs, where each
natural language proof step is paired with the corresponding logically
equivalent tactic in Lean. The Autoformalizer correctly formalizes 57% of
tactics in correct proofs and accurately identifies the incorrect step in 30%
of incorrect proofs. In generating natural language hints for erroneous proofs,
LeanTutor outperforms a simple baseline on accuracy and relevance metrics.

Abstract: Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering
workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design,
modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical
layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small
changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired
outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning
within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce
ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter
tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores
parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard
Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final
design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and
a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed
wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer
optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to
trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and
interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent
is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM
without any further fine-tuning.

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and
iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan
according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining
throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete
floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process.
Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs,
improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated
modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised
learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones.
First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet,
specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor
plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which
reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a
lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy
of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally,
we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of
architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can
generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This
framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad
application prospects.

Abstract: Recent studies empirically reveal that large reasoning models (LRMs) can
automatically allocate more reasoning strengths (i.e., the number of reasoning
tokens) for harder problems, exhibiting difficulty-awareness for better task
performance. While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has
been widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To
this end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of
model activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths
in their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength
causally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector.
Specifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely
based on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs
estimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs
encode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector
embedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude
modulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced
reasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to
increased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further
reveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length
prediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token </think> to
affect the reasoning length. Finally, we demonstrate two potential applications
of our findings: overthinking behavior detection and enabling efficient

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure safe and appropriate responses from VLMs in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios, addressing the challenge of overrefusal and poor generalization in existing methods.

Method: SafeCoT uses rule-based chain-of-thought supervision to guide VLMs in reasoning about safety risks and making context-aware refusals, requiring minimal supervision.

Result: Experiments show SafeCoT reduces overrefusal and improves generalization even with limited training data, offering a scalable solution for safety alignment in VLMs.

Conclusion: SafeCoT provides an effective, interpretable method for enhancing the safety of VLMs through lightweight, rule-based CoT supervision.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and appropriate responses from vision-language models (VLMs)
remains a critical challenge, particularly in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios.
We introduce SafeCoT, a lightweight, interpretable framework that leverages
rule-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision to improve refusal behavior in
VLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on large-scale safety annotations or
complex modeling, SafeCoT uses minimal supervision to help models reason about
safety risks and make context-aware refusals. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances
generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable
solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Graph recommendation systems have been widely studied due to their ability to
effectively capture the complex interactions between users and items. However,
these systems also exhibit certain vulnerabilities when faced with attacks. The
prevailing shilling attack methods typically manipulate recommendation results
by injecting a large number of fake nodes and edges. However, such attack
strategies face two primary challenges: low stealth and high destructiveness.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph backdoor attack
method that aims to enhance the exposure of target items to the target user in
a covert manner, without affecting other unrelated nodes. Specifically, we
design a single-node trigger generator, which can effectively expose multiple
target items to the target user by inserting only one fake user node.
Additionally, we introduce constraint conditions between the target nodes and
irrelevant nodes to mitigate the impact of fake nodes on the recommendation
system's performance. Experimental results show that the exposure of the target
items reaches no less than 50% in 99% of the target users, while the impact on
the recommendation system's performance is controlled within approximately 5%.

Abstract: Having a unified, coherent taxonomy is essential for effective knowledge
representation in domain-specific applications as diverse terminologies need to
be mapped to underlying concepts. Traditional manual approaches to taxonomy
alignment rely on expert review of concept pairs, but this becomes
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at scale, while subjective
interpretations often lead to expert disagreements. Existing automated methods
for taxonomy alignment have shown promise but face limitations in handling
nuanced semantic relationships and maintaining consistency across different
domains. These approaches often struggle with context-dependent concept
mappings and lack transparent reasoning processes. We propose a novel framework
that combines large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and
iterative prompt optimization to automate taxonomy alignment. Our method
integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human
validation to guide LLMs in generating both taxonomy linkages and supporting
rationales. In evaluating our framework on a domain-specific mapping task of
concept essentiality, we achieved an F1-score of 0.97, substantially exceeding
the human benchmark of 0.68. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in scaling taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings
and preserving expert oversight for ambiguous cases.

Abstract: Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown
great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they
overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we
advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet
challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce
SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles.
Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the
Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both
efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically select nodes
to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively
allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared
representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits
the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local
representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key
features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to
significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9
real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has long represented one of the most fundamental and
challenging frontiers in artificial intelligence research. In recent years,
large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in this area.
This survey examines the development of mathematical reasoning abilities in
LLMs through two high-level cognitive phases: comprehension, where models gain
mathematical understanding via diverse pretraining strategies, and answer
generation, which has progressed from direct prediction to step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We review methods for enhancing mathematical
reasoning, ranging from training-free prompting to fine-tuning approaches such
as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and discuss recent work
on extended CoT and "test-time scaling". Despite notable progress, fundamental
challenges remain in terms of capacity, efficiency, and generalization. To
address these issues, we highlight promising research directions, including
advanced pretraining and knowledge augmentation techniques, formal reasoning
frameworks, and meta-generalization through principled learning paradigms. This
survey tries to provide some insights for researchers interested in enhancing
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and for those seeking to apply these techniques
to other domains.

Abstract: Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks
are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult
to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend
on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their
ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings.
Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but
rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications.
Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise
and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming
to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a
commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model
enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for
engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to
access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought
reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to
out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process
monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine
instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the
foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with
context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted
deployment in industrial settings.

<details>

Motivation: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare digital twins necessitates addressing issues like hallucination, bias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse, especially in consumer health applications.

Method: RHealthTwin employs a Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE) that structures multimodal inputs by dynamically extracting predefined slots, guiding the LLM to generate context-aware, personalized, and explainable responses. It also includes a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

Result: RPE achieves high performance metrics (BLEU=0.41, ROUGE-L=0.63, BERTScore=0.89) on benchmark datasets and over 90% ethical compliance and instruction-following scores, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: RHealthTwin offers a responsible foundation for LLM-based health applications, ensuring safety, fairness, and reliability through structured prompting and adaptive feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new possibilities for
digital twins in healthcare. However, the deployment of such systems in
consumer health contexts raises significant concerns related to hallucination,
bias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse. In response to recommendations
from health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), we propose
Responsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin), a principled framework for building and
governing AI-powered digital twins for well-being assistance. RHealthTwin
processes multimodal inputs that guide a health-focused LLM to produce safe,
relevant, and explainable responses. At the core of RHealthTwin is the
Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE), which addresses the limitations of traditional
LLM configuration. Conventionally, users input unstructured prompt and the
system instruction to configure the LLM, which increases the risk of
hallucination. In contrast, RPE extracts predefined slots dynamically to
structure both inputs. This guides the language model to generate responses
that are context aware, personalized, fair, reliable, and explainable for
well-being assistance. The framework further adapts over time through a
feedback loop that updates the prompt structure based on user satisfaction. We
evaluate RHealthTwin across four consumer health domains including mental
support, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching. RPE
achieves state-of-the-art results with BLEU = 0.41, ROUGE-L = 0.63, and
BERTScore = 0.89 on benchmark datasets. Also, we achieve over 90% in ethical
compliance and instruction-following metrics using LLM-as-judge evaluation,
outperforming baseline strategies. We envision RHealthTwin as a forward-looking
foundation for responsible LLM-based applications in health and well-being.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on
unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While
recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,
existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and
conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain
generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through
sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a
gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and
adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class
imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a
curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes
underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution
alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy
regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies
optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional
alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive
evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that
FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of
domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both
centralized and federated settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/FedTail

Motivation: The low-altitude economy's growth necessitates better UAV trajectory planning, but existing studies neglect urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency.

Method: The framework combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with large language model (LLM) reasoning for safe and economically viable path planning.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms baselines in data collection, collision avoidance, landing success, compliance, and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses key challenges in UAV trajectory planning under low-altitude economy constraints.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread
adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents
new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments.
However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace
constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude
economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising
solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low
learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV
trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM)
reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate,
collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy
efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in
addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the
low-altitude economy networking.

Abstract: Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource
allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate
resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource
deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The
sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed
by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a
globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an
enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent
hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation
in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer
feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from
lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy,
thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical
decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly
improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving
superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformance checking in process mining is crucial for assessing how well observed process executions match a normative model. However, current approaches using alignments face challenges with state space explosion and inability to capture concurrent behaviors effectively.

Method: The paper proposes FoldA, which computes partial-order alignments on the fly by utilizing directed Petri net unfoldings, offering a more efficient way to handle concurrency and reduce state space complexity.

Result: Evaluation on 485 synthetic and 13 real-life model-log pairs showed that FoldA reduces queued states and provides a more accurate concurrency representation, despite higher computation time.

Conclusion: FoldA presents a promising approach for conformance checking by effectively managing concurrency and mitigating state space explosion, though it may require more computational resources.

Abstract: Conformance checking is a fundamental task of process mining, which
quantifies the extent to which the observed process executions match a
normative process model. The state-of-the-art approaches compute alignments by
exploring the state space formed by the synchronous product of the process
model and the trace. This often leads to state space explosion, particularly
when the model exhibits a high degree of choice and concurrency. Moreover, as
alignments inherently impose a sequential structure, they fail to fully
represent the concurrent behavior present in many real-world processes. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes a new technique for computing
partial-order alignments {on the fly using directed Petri net unfoldings, named
FoldA. We evaluate our technique on 485 synthetic model-log pairs and compare
it against Astar- and Dijkstra-alignments on 13 real-life model-log pairs and 6
benchmark pairs. The results show that our unfolding alignment, although it
requires more computation time, generally reduces the number of queued states
and provides a more accurate representation of concurrency.

Motivation: Creating a universal controller for any robot morphology can enhance computational and data efficiency, but generalizing to new, unseen robots remains challenging.

Method: The paper implements a modular recurrent architecture that uses contextual information about individual robots and their modular structure to infer relevant data through interactions.

Result: The architecture shows substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics, kinematics, and topologies across four different environments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that inferring contextual information through interactions can lead to better generalization in multi-robot control scenarios.

Abstract: A universal controller for any robot morphology would greatly improve
computational and data efficiency. By utilizing contextual information about
the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in
the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made
towards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however,
remains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual
information is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through
interactions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during
training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and
evaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The
results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics,
kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.

Abstract: Recent advances of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have highlighted its potential

supervision, which limits the broader applicability. In this work, we propose a
novel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language
Model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning
states across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct
responses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model
likelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their
own final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other
candidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo,
an intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a
robust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to
promote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a
self-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason
without external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning
benchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing
supervised RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, interested variables are often represented as
discretized values due to measurement limitations. Applying Conditional
Independence (CI) tests directly to such discretized data, however, can lead to
incorrect conclusions. To address this, recent advancements have sought to
infer the correct CI relationship between the latent variables through
binarizing observed data. However, this process inevitably results in a loss of
information, which degrades the test's performance. Motivated by this, this
paper introduces a sample-efficient CI test that does not rely on the
binarization process. We find that the independence relationships of latent
continuous variables can be established by addressing an over-identifying
restriction problem with Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Based on this
insight, we derive an appropriate test statistic and establish its asymptotic
distribution correctly reflecting CI by leveraging nodewise regression.
Theoretical findings and Empirical results across various datasets demonstrate

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs is crucial for
understanding multivariate interactions in complex systems. Knowledge-based
causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning
over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a
compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data.
However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce
unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal
inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery.
Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and
further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based
models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts,
improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship.
Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores,
evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs. Our code and datasets are available on

load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring
essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs,
n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG
revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants
exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed
moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity.
Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4,
LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity,
indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall
and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search
Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group
and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately
quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings
highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently
underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results
raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and
underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.

Abstract: Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success
in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by
decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific
weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally
and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the
solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the
limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables
adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently
optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values.
Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems
to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven
optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and
losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying
it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results
across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority
and strong generalization.

Abstract: Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of
road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to
mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical
components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28%
of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well
as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important
question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and
micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep
Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting
point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they
are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on
traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the
movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting
trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic
dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities
better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are
evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory
reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live'
microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider
traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed
stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to
train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into
model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a
state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset
collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection.
We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a
microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using
ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory
reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break
traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors
and present our results.

Motivation: Link prediction in NKGs is essential for completing them and improving downstream application performance, and has recently gained significant attention.

Result: The survey offers an overview of the field, analyzes methods' performance and application scenarios, and outlines future research directions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with promising directions for future research in link prediction for NKGs.

Abstract: N-ary Knowledge Graphs (NKGs) are a specialized type of knowledge graph
designed to efficiently represent complex real-world facts. Unlike traditional
knowledge graphs, where a fact typically involves two entities, NKGs can
capture n-ary facts containing more than two entities. Link prediction in NKGs
aims to predict missing elements within these n-ary facts, which is essential
for completing NKGs and improving the performance of downstream applications.
This task has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we present
the first comprehensive survey of link prediction in NKGs, providing an
overview of the field, systematically categorizing existing methods, and
analyzing their performance and application scenarios. We also outline
promising directions for future research.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliably deployed in both everyday and
high-stakes domains, knowing when not to answer is equally critical as
answering correctly. Real-world user queries, which can be underspecified,
ill-posed, or fundamentally unanswerable, require LLMs to reason about
uncertainty and selectively abstain -- i.e., refuse to answer definitively.
However, abstention remains understudied, without a systematic evaluation
framework for modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce AbstentionBench, a
large-scale benchmark for holistically evaluating abstention across 20 diverse
datasets, including questions with unknown answers, underspecification, false
premises, subjective interpretations, and outdated information. Evaluating 20
frontier LLMs reveals abstention is an unsolved problem, and one where scaling
models is of little use. While recent reasoning LLMs have shown impressive
results in complex problem solving, surprisingly, we find that reasoning
fine-tuning degrades abstention (by $24\%$ on average), even for math and
science domains on which reasoning models are explicitly trained. We find that
while a carefully crafted system prompt can boost abstention in practice, it
does not resolve models' fundamental inability to reason about uncertainty. We
release AbstentionBench to foster research into advancing LLM reliability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core
challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven
reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have
begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However,
these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse
embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical
benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three
structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception.
VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations,
and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual
inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a
two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM)
using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement
learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that
VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels.
Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of
compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together,
VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing
multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: How well do AI systems perform in algorithm engineering for hard optimization
problems in domains such as package-delivery routing, crew scheduling, factory

benchmark for evaluating AI systems on score-based algorithmic programming
contests. Drawing on real tasks from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, ALE-Bench
presents optimization problems that are computationally hard and admit no known
exact solution. Unlike short-duration, pass/fail coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench
encourages iterative solution refinement over long time horizons. Our software
framework supports interactive agent architectures that leverage test-run
feedback and visualizations. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs revealed that
while they demonstrate high performance on specific problems, a notable gap
remains compared to humans in terms of consistency across problems and
long-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This highlights the need for this
benchmark to foster future AI advancements.

*Toyin Aguda,Erik Wilson,Allan Anzagira,Simerjot Kaur,Charese Smiley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the conservative bias in large language models during relation extraction, where they often choose 'No_Relation' when no appropriate label is available, leading to information loss. It introduces 'Hobson's choice' to describe this trade-off and finds that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the trade-off between conservative bias and hallucination in LLMs during relation extraction tasks, as the conservative behavior can lead to significant information loss when reasoning isn't explicitly included in the output.

Method: The paper evaluates the trade-off across various prompts, datasets, and relation types. It introduces the concept of Hobson's choice and uses SBERT and LLM prompts to measure semantic similarity between conservative bias behaviors in constrained prompts and labels from semi-constrained and open-ended prompts.

Result: The findings show that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination, indicating a significant information loss when models use 'No_Relation' labels without explicit reasoning.

Conclusion: The study concludes that conservative bias in LLMs is a critical issue leading to information loss, and the concept of Hobson's choice helps capture scenarios where safe but uninformative labels are preferred over hallucinated ones. It suggests the need to address this bias in future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced conservative bias in relation
extraction tasks, frequently defaulting to No_Relation label when an
appropriate option is unavailable. While this behavior helps prevent incorrect
relation assignments, our analysis reveals that it also leads to significant
information loss when reasoning is not explicitly included in the output. We
systematically evaluate this trade-off across multiple prompts, datasets, and
relation types, introducing the concept of Hobson's choice to capture scenarios
where models opt for safe but uninformative labels over hallucinated ones. Our
findings suggest that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination.
To quantify this effect, we use SBERT and LLM prompts to capture the semantic
similarity between conservative bias behaviors in constrained prompts and
labels generated from semi-constrained and open-ended prompts.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Alignment of large language models with explicit principles (such as
helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) is crucial for ensuring safe and
reliable AI systems. However, standard reward-based alignment methods typically
collapse diverse feedback into a single scalar reward, entangling multiple
objectives into one opaque training signal, which hinders interpretability. In
this work, we introduce QA-LIGN, an automatic symbolic reward decomposition
approach that preserves the structure of each constitutional principle within
the reward mechanism. Instead of training a black-box reward model that outputs
a monolithic score, QA-LIGN formulates principle-specific evaluation questions
and derives separate reward components for each principle, making it a drop-in
reward model replacement. Experiments aligning an uncensored large language
model with a set of constitutional principles demonstrate that QA-LIGN offers
greater transparency and adaptability in the alignment process. At the same
time, our approach achieves performance on par with or better than a DPO
baseline. Overall, these results represent a step toward more interpretable and
controllable alignment of language models, achieved without sacrificing
end-task performance.

Abstract: We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on
complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark
comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains
such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task
challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual
content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive
data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting
multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by
rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability.
Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data
sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a
diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure
cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding,
plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial
performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation,
and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed
for economic web intelligence.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping
opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful
content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity.
While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like
English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using
translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual
dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and
Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced
distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology
leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate
speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature
extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including
GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models
like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators,
following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a
Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5
Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of
0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for
Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B).
These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline
0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM
baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline
0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech
detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) seeks to integrate new knowledge
while preserving past information. However, existing methods struggle with
efficiency and scalability due to two key limitations: (1) suboptimal knowledge
preservation between snapshots caused by manually designed node/relation
importance scores that ignore graph dependencies relevant to the downstream
task, and (2) computationally expensive graph traversal for node/relation
importance calculation, leading to slow training and high memory overhead. To
address these limitations, we introduce ETT-CKGE (Efficient, Task-driven,
Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding), a novel task-guided CKGE
method that leverages efficient task-driven tokens for efficient and effective
knowledge transfer between snapshots. Our method introduces a set of learnable
tokens that directly capture task-relevant signals, eliminating the need for
explicit node scoring or traversal. These tokens serve as consistent and
reusable guidance across snapshots, enabling efficient token-masked embedding
alignment between snapshots. Importantly, knowledge transfer is achieved
through simple matrix operations, significantly reducing training time and
memory usage. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ETT-CKGE consistently achieves superior or competitive predictive
performance, while substantially improving training efficiency and scalability
compared to state-of-the-art CKGE methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of rigorous assessment of AI-generated stories, especially regarding their aesthetic qualities and literary merit.

Method: The method involves creating GrAImes, an evaluation protocol grounded in literary theory, and validating it with both literature experts and enthusiasts.

Result: The results show that the evaluation protocol can effectively assess AI-generated microfictions, providing an objective framework for their literary value.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that GrAImes offers a foundation for evaluating AI-generated microfictions and emphasizes the need for considering literary criteria in their assessment.

Abstract: Automated story writing has been a subject of study for over 60 years. Large
language models can generate narratively consistent and linguistically coherent
short fiction texts. Despite these advancements, rigorous assessment of such
outputs for literary merit - especially concerning aesthetic qualities - has
received scant attention. In this paper, we address the challenge of evaluating
AI-generated microfictions and argue that this task requires consideration of
literary criteria across various aspects of the text, such as thematic
coherence, textual clarity, interpretive depth, and aesthetic quality. To
facilitate this, we present GrAImes: an evaluation protocol grounded in
literary theory, specifically drawing from a literary perspective, to offer an
objective framework for assessing AI-generated microfiction. Furthermore, we
report the results of our validation of the evaluation protocol, as answered by
both literature experts and literary enthusiasts. This protocol will serve as a
foundation for evaluating automatically generated microfictions and assessing
their literary value.

Abstract: The rapid growth of English technical terms challenges traditional

quantum computing. Manual methods struggle to ensure multilingual consistency.
We propose \textbf{LLM-BT}, a back-translation framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) to automate terminology verification and standardization
via cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our contributions are: \textbf{(1)
Term-Level Consistency Validation:} Using English $\rightarrow$ intermediate
language $\rightarrow$ English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term
consistency across models (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek, Grok), with case studies
showing over 90\% exact or semantic matches. \textbf{(2) Multi-Path
Verification Workflow:} A novel ``Retrieve--Generate--Verify--Optimize''
pipeline integrates serial (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ ZHcn $\rightarrow$ ZHtw
$\rightarrow$ EN) and parallel (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ Chinese/Portuguese
$\rightarrow$ EN) BT routes. BLEU and term accuracy indicate strong
cross-lingual robustness (BLEU $>$ 0.45; Portuguese accuracy 100\%).
\textbf{(3) Back-Translation as Semantic Embedding:} BT is conceptualized as
dynamic semantic embedding, revealing latent meaning trajectories. Unlike
static embeddings, LLM-BT provides transparent path-based embeddings shaped by
model evolution. LLM-BT transforms back-translation into an active engine for
multilingual terminology standardization, enabling human--AI collaboration:
machines ensure semantic fidelity, humans guide cultural interpretation. This
infrastructure supports terminology governance across scientific and
technological fields worldwide.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly
recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup.
While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of
intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the
proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier
information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such
interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce
PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value
updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are
clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines
log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from
retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via
prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield
limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs'
ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information,
suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls
for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content
during retrieval.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) like Gemini are becoming common tools for
supporting student writing. But most of their feedback is based only on the
final essay missing important context about how that text was written. In this
paper, we explore whether using writing process data, collected through
keystroke logging and periodic snapshots, can help LLMs give feedback that
better reflects how learners think and revise while writing. We built a digital
writing tool that captures both what students type and how their essays evolve
over time. Twenty students used this tool to write timed essays, which were
then evaluated in two ways: (i) LLM generated feedback using both the final
essay and the full writing trace, and (ii) After the task, students completed
surveys about how useful and relatable they found the feedback. Early results
show that learners preferred the process-aware LLM feedback, finding it more in
tune with their own thinking. We also found that certain types of edits, like
adding new content or reorganizing paragraphs, aligned closely with higher
scores in areas like coherence and elaboration. Our findings suggest that
making LLMs more aware of the writing process can lead to feedback that feels
more meaningful, personal, and supportive.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for complex research
tasks such as literature review, idea generation, and scientific paper

relationships within complex research papers, such as the logical links between
claims and supporting evidence remains largely unexplored. In this study, we
present CLAIM-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
capabilities in scientific claim-evidence extraction and validation, a task
that reflects deeper comprehension of scientific argumentation. We
systematically compare three approaches which are inspired by divide and
conquer approaches, across six diverse LLMs, highlighting model-specific
strengths and weaknesses in scientific comprehension. Through evaluation
involving over 300 claim-evidence pairs across multiple research domains, we
reveal significant limitations in LLMs' ability to process complex scientific
content. Our results demonstrate that closed-source models like GPT-4 and
Claude consistently outperform open-source counterparts in precision and recall
across claim-evidence identification tasks. Furthermore, strategically designed
three-pass and one-by-one prompting approaches significantly improve LLMs'
abilities to accurately link dispersed evidence with claims, although this
comes at increased computational cost. CLAIM-BENCH sets a new standard for
evaluating scientific comprehension in LLMs, offering both a diagnostic tool
and a path forward for building systems capable of deeper, more reliable
reasoning across full-length papers.

Abstract: Inference making is an essential but complex skill in reading comprehension
(RC). Some inferences require resolving references across sentences, and some
rely on using prior knowledge to fill in the detail that is not explicitly
written in the text. Diagnostic RC questions can help educators provide more
effective and targeted reading instruction and interventions for school-age
students. We introduce a taxonomy of inference types for RC and use it to
analyze the distribution of items within a diagnostic RC item bank. Next, we
present experiments using GPT-4o to generate bridging-inference RC items for
given reading passages via few-shot prompting, comparing conditions with and
without chain-of-thought prompts. Generated items were evaluated on three
aspects: overall item quality, appropriate inference type, and LLM reasoning,
achieving high inter-rater agreements above 0.90. Our results show that GPT-4o
produced 93.8% good-quality questions suitable for operational use in grade
3-12 contexts; however, only 42.6% of the generated questions accurately
matched the targeted inference type. We conclude that combining automatic item
generation with human judgment offers a promising path toward scalable,
high-quality diagnostic RC assessments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) use data to learn about the world in order to
produce meaningful correlations and predictions. As such, the nature, scale,
quality, and diversity of the datasets used to train these models, or to
support their work at inference time, have a direct impact on their quality.
The rapid development and adoption of LLMs of varying quality has brought into
focus the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality training data and
revealed an urgent need to ground the stewardship of these datasets in
sustainable practices with clear provenance chains. To that end, this technical
report introduces Institutional Books 1.0, a large collection of public domain

Google Books project, beginning in 2006. Working with Harvard Library, we
extracted, analyzed, and processed these volumes into an extensively-documented

Library's collection scanned as part of that project, originally spanning
1,075,899 volumes written in over 250 different languages for a total of
approximately 250 billion tokens. As part of this initial release, the
OCR-extracted text (original and post-processed) as well as the metadata

Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of overthinking in large reasoning models, which leads to verbose and redundant outputs, thereby improving efficiency without sacrificing utility.

Method: The method involves disabling explicit self-reflection by suppressing specific tokens ('Wait', 'Hmm') during inference, which simplifies the reasoning process and reduces verbosity.

Result: NoWait reduces chain-of-thought trajectory length by 27%-51% across five R1-style model series in textual, visual, and video reasoning tasks, while maintaining model utility.

Conclusion: NoWait provides an efficient, plug-and-play solution for multimodal reasoning without compromising utility, suggesting that explicit self-reflection tokens may not be necessary for effective reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step
reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose
and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether
explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is
necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective
approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens
during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual,
visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought
trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without
compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for
efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-cognitive-level framework inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy to evaluate LLMs in medical tasks, finding that performance drops with cognitive complexity and model size is more critical at higher levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capabilities of LLMs across different cognitive levels in the medical domain, as they have shown strong performance on benchmarks but lack understanding of higher-level cognition.

Method: Developed a framework using existing medical datasets with tasks for three cognitive levels: knowledge grasp, application, and problem solving.

Result: Performance significantly decreases with higher cognitive complexity, and larger models perform better at advanced levels.

Conclusion: LLMs need improvement in higher medical cognitive tasks, and model size is crucial for advanced performance, offering insights for real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various medical benchmarks, but their capabilities across different cognitive
levels remain underexplored. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, we propose a
multi-cognitive-level evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in the medical
domain in this study. The framework integrates existing medical datasets and
introduces tasks targeting three cognitive levels: preliminary knowledge grasp,
comprehensive knowledge application, and scenario-based problem solving. Using
this framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical
LLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek.
Our findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity
increases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role
in performance at higher cognitive levels. Our study highlights the need to
enhance LLMs' medical capabilities at higher cognitive levels and provides
insights for developing LLMs suited to real-world medical applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This position paper argues that the text embedding research community should
move beyond surface meaning and embrace implicit semantics as a central
modeling goal. Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP,
powering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research
attention. Yet, much of this progress remains narrowly focused on surface-level
semantics. In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often
implicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context.
Current embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth
and evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a
result, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker
stance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that
even state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic
baselines on implicit semantics tasks. To address this, we call for a paradigm
shift: embedding research should prioritize more diverse and linguistically
grounded training data, design benchmarks that evaluate deeper semantic
understanding, and explicitly frame implicit meaning as a core modeling
objective, better aligning embeddings with real-world language complexity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Inference-time steering aims to alter the response characteristics of large
language models (LLMs) without modifying their underlying parameters. A
critical step in this process is the identification of internal modules within
LLMs that are associated with the target behavior. However, current approaches
to module selection often depend on superficial cues or ad-hoc heuristics,
which can result in suboptimal or unintended outcomes. In this work, we propose
a principled causal-attribution framework for identifying behavior-relevant
attention heads in transformers. For each head, we train a vector-quantized
autoencoder (VQ-AE) on its attention activations, partitioning the latent space
into behavior-relevant and behavior-irrelevant subspaces, each quantized with a
shared learnable codebook. We assess the behavioral relevance of each head by
quantifying the separability of VQ-AE encodings for behavior-aligned versus
behavior-violating responses using a binary classification metric. This yields
a behavioral relevance score that reflects each head discriminative capacity
with respect to the target behavior, guiding both selection and importance
weighting. Experiments on seven LLMs from two model families and five
behavioral steering datasets demonstrate that our method enables more accurate
inference-time interventions, achieving superior performance on the
truthfulness-steering task. Furthermore, the heads selected by our approach
exhibit strong zero-shot generalization in cross-domain truthfulness-steering
scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding cause and effect relationships remains a formidable challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in specialized domains where
reasoning requires more than surface-level correlations. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy, but standard RAG pipelines treat
evidence as flat context, lacking the structure required to model true causal
dependencies. We introduce Causal-Chain RAG (CC-RAG), a novel approach that
integrates zero-shot triple extraction and theme-aware graph chaining into the
RAG pipeline, enabling structured multi-hop inference. Given a domain specific
corpus, CC-RAG constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of <cause, relation,
effect> triples and uses forward/backward chaining to guide structured answer
generation. Experiments on two real-world domains: Bitcoin price fluctuations
and Gaucher disease, show that CC-RAG outperforms standard RAG and zero-shot
LLMs in chain similarity, information density, and lexical diversity. Both
LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations consistently favor CC-RAG. Our results
demonstrate that explicitly modeling causal structure enables LLMs to generate
more accurate and interpretable responses, especially in specialized domains
where flat retrieval fails.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) support long contexts, they struggle with
performance degradation within the context window. Current solutions incur
prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective
approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the
Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio
correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the
attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding
space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive
Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with
those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the
gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of
long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates
attention score degradation. Experimental results show that PCD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on long-context benchmarks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory
complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value
(KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely
on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel
framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to
more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we
introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which
leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair
for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft
model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt
tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft
models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility
beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with
theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the
attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on
long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher
accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in
memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at

Abstract: With the development and widespread application of large language models
(LLMs), the new paradigm of "Model as Product" is rapidly evolving, and demands
higher capabilities to address complex user needs, often requiring precise
workflow execution which involves the accurate understanding of multiple tasks.
However, existing benchmarks focusing on single-task environments with limited
constraints lack the complexity required to fully reflect real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we present the Extremely Complex Instruction Following
Benchmark (EIFBENCH), meticulously crafted to facilitate a more realistic and
robust evaluation of LLMs. EIFBENCH not only includes multi-task scenarios that
enable comprehensive assessment across diverse task types concurrently, but
also integrates a variety of constraints, replicating complex operational
environments. Furthermore, we propose the Segment Policy Optimization (SegPO)
algorithm to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately fulfill multi-task
workflow. Evaluations on EIFBENCH have unveiled considerable performance
discrepancies in existing LLMs when challenged with these extremely complex
instructions. This finding underscores the necessity for ongoing optimization
to navigate the intricate challenges posed by LLM applications.

Result: There is a significant performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages, particularly for African and Americas/Oceania languages.

Conclusion: More investment is needed to improve the coverage of low-resource languages in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a
wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However,
their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages.
For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In
this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to
evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language
identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks
on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading
LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open
models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in
performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for

Abstract: Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language
processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there
has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing
the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies
have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into
collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation
quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing
multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from
cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators
employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free
translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating
outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed
multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with
Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six
functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in
human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement,
evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By
simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC
effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation.
Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24
benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by
an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it
further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23. Code is available at

Abstract: Previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive error detection
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), often prompting them to analyze
mistakes in reasoning chains. However, few studies have examined the
meta-cognitive abilities of LLMs (e.g., their self-awareness of step errors),
which are crucial for their reliability. While studies on LLM self-evaluation
present some measures, such as perplexity, which can reflect the answer
correctness and be viewed as the lens of meta-cognition, they lack step-level
analysis and adaptation. This paper studies the evaluation of LLM
meta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses.
Specifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation
framework for benchmarking the existing lenses. Furthermore, a training-free
Markovian Intrinsic Reward Adjustment strategy, MIRA, is proposed to boost
current meta-cognition lenses. Experimental results on three mathematical
reasoning datasets and three LLMs show the reasonableness of AutoMeco by
comparing it with Best-of-N verification. Moreover, the meta-cognition ability
of LLMs can be better evaluated using MIRA.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there is a growing

Consequently, many interpretation methods have emerged, aiming to unravel the
knowledge mechanisms of LLMs from various perspectives. However, current
interpretation methods differ in input data formats and interpreting outputs.
The tools integrating these methods are only capable of supporting tasks with
specific inputs, significantly constraining their practical applications. To
address these challenges, we present an open-source Knowledge Mechanisms
Revealer&Interpreter (Know-MRI) designed to analyze the knowledge mechanisms
within LLMs systematically. Specifically, we have developed an extensible core
module that can automatically match different input data with interpretation
methods and consolidate the interpreting outputs. It enables users to freely
choose appropriate interpretation methods based on the inputs, making it easier
to comprehensively diagnose the model's internal knowledge mechanisms from
multiple perspectives. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of
sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony
detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient
comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper

analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent
then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent
providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark
datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving
SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of
76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This
success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective
analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs is expensive and biased towards dominant cultures, and domain adaptation is a promising strategy but computationally costly for under-resourced groups.

Method: We evaluate different numerical precisions and data parallelization strategies to assess their impact on training speed and model accuracy.

Result: The study finds that using lower numerical precisions and efficient data parallelization strategies can improve training speed and reduce computational costs without significant loss in model accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that optimizing numerical precision and data parallelization can make domain adaptation more feasible in low-resource environments, enhancing energy efficiency and accessibility.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly in terms of energy, hardware,
and annotated data, often resulting in a positionality rooted in predominant
cultures and values (Santy et al., 2023). Domain adaptation has emerged as a
promising strategy to better align models with diverse cultural and value
contexts (Hershcovich et al., 2022), but its computational cost remains a
significant barrier, particularly for research groups lacking access to
large-scale infrastructure. In this paper, we evaluate how the use of different
numerical precisions and data parallelization strategies impacts both training
speed (as a proxy to energy and hardware consumption) and model accuracy, with
the goal of facilitating domain adaptation in low-resource environments. Our
findings are relevant to any setting where energy efficiency, accessibility, or
limited hardware availability are key concerns.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Most existing structured pruning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs)
require substantial computational and data resources for retraining to
reestablish the corrupted correlations, making them prohibitively expensive. To
address this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal
decomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for
retraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer
depends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as
unified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract
the most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or
disrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes
unnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of
PCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally,
to mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward
network (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct
the residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices. By leveraging
singular value decomposition (SVD) on the solution of the least-squares
problem, these matrices are obtained without requiring retraining. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed Olica is efficient in terms of data usage,
GPU memory, and running time, while delivering superior performance across
multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Detecting harmful memes is essential for maintaining the integrity of online
environments. However, current approaches often struggle with resource
efficiency, flexibility, or explainability, limiting their practical deployment
in content moderation systems. To address these challenges, we introduce
U-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely
on prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity
meme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual
descriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme
classification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual
content and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general
large language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we
further incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide
models' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows
for easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across
platforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and
explainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the
effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and
low-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context language models (LCLMs)
both address context limitations of LLMs in open-domain question answering
(QA). However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem:
fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence.
Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM
prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA,
where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present
Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that
adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the
similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not
require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing
retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks,
Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x
fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant
passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models,
highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient
and accurate QA.

empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to
fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models.
Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment
evaluation.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Small Language Models (SLMs) for on-device and
resource-constrained deployments has outpaced our understanding of their
ethical risks. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale
audit of instruction-tuned SLMs spanning 0.5 to 5 billion parameters-an
overlooked "middle tier" between BERT-class encoders and flagship LLMs. Our
evaluation includes nine open-source models from the Qwen 2.5, LLaMA 3.2, Gemma
3, and Phi families. Using the BBQ benchmark under zero-shot prompting, we
analyze both utility and fairness across ambiguous and disambiguated contexts.
This evaluation reveals three key insights. First, competence and fairness need
not be antagonistic: Phi models achieve F1 scores exceeding 90 percent while
exhibiting minimal bias, showing that efficient and ethical NLP is attainable.
Second, social bias varies significantly by architecture: Qwen 2.5 models may
appear fair, but this often reflects vacuous neutrality, random guessing, or
evasive behavior rather than genuine ethical alignment. In contrast, LLaMA 3.2
models exhibit stronger stereotypical bias, suggesting overconfidence rather
than neutrality. Third, compression introduces nuanced trade-offs: 4-bit AWQ
quantization improves F1 scores in ambiguous settings for LLaMA 3.2-3B but
increases disability-related bias in Phi-4-Mini by over 7 percentage points.
These insights provide practical guidance for the responsible deployment of
SLMs in applications demanding fairness and efficiency, particularly benefiting
small enterprises and resource-constrained environments.

Etiquettes are region-specific and are an essential part of the culture of a
region; hence, it is imperative to make LLMs sensitive to etiquettes. However,
there needs to be more resources in evaluating LLMs for their understanding and
bias with regard to etiquettes. In this resource paper, we introduce EtiCor++,
a corpus of etiquettes worldwide. We introduce different tasks for evaluating
LLMs for knowledge about etiquettes across various regions. Further, we
introduce various metrics for measuring bias in LLMs. Extensive experimentation
with LLMs shows inherent bias towards certain regions.

### [166] [Integration of Old and New Knowledge for Generalized Intent Discovery: A Consistency-driven Prototype-Prompting Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08490)
*Xiao Wei,Xiaobao Wang,Ning Zhuang,Chenyang Wang,Longbiao Wang,Jianwu dang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a consistency-driven prototype-prompting framework for Generalized Intent Discovery (GID), integrating old and new knowledge to improve performance on out-of-domain intents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of supervised intent detection methods that rely on labeled in-domain data and struggle with out-of-domain intents, while existing GID methods neglect domain adaptation.

Method: A framework combining prototype-prompting for transferring old knowledge and hierarchical consistency constraints for learning new knowledge from target domains.

Result: The method significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results in GID.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances intent detection by integrating domain adaptation and knowledge consistency, showing strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Intent detection aims to identify user intents from natural language inputs,
where supervised methods rely heavily on labeled in-domain (IND) data and
struggle with out-of-domain (OOD) intents, limiting their practical
applicability. Generalized Intent Discovery (GID) addresses this by leveraging
unlabeled OOD data to discover new intents without additional annotation.
However, existing methods focus solely on clustering unsupervised data while
neglecting domain adaptation. Therefore, we propose a consistency-driven
prototype-prompting framework for GID from the perspective of integrating old
and new knowledge, which includes a prototype-prompting framework for
transferring old knowledge from external sources, and a hierarchical
consistency constraint for learning new knowledge from target domains. We
conducted extensive experiments and the results show that our method
significantly outperforms all baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
results, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of
our methods. Our source code is publicly available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces CONFLICTS, a benchmark for evaluating how LLMs handle knowledge conflicts in RAG, highlighting that current models struggle but can improve with explicit reasoning prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of resolving conflicting information in RAG systems, which is crucial for improving the reliability and accuracy of LLMs when they have access to multiple, sometimes contradictory, sources.

Method: The method involves proposing a taxonomy of knowledge conflict types and creating the CONFLICTS benchmark with expert annotations to assess model behavior in handling these conflicts.

Result: Results show that LLMs often fail to resolve conflicts between sources, but explicit prompting about potential conflicts leads to better response quality and appropriateness.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that while explicit reasoning prompts help, there is still significant room for improvement in future research on handling knowledge conflicts in RAG.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date
information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting
information and it remains unclear how models should address such
discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge
conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We
then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of
conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark
that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge
conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that
LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While
prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the
retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of
their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned TTS models to enhance compatibility and user engagement, arguing that advanced components are unnecessary as LLM reasoning improves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a more engaging experience for human players in social deduction games like Werewolf by leveraging advancements in LLMs, particularly DeepSeek R1 and V3 models, which have stronger reasoning and persuasion capabilities.

Method: The method involves proposing a novel yet straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned TTS models, designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models and improved user engagement.

Result: The result is a game system that achieves an engaging text-format Werewolf experience without needing fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pools, as the LLM's reasoning capabilities are sufficient.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that as LLM reasoning continues to improve, extra components like fine-tuning or prompting engineering may become unnecessary for creating engaging social deduction games, and a simpler system with tuned TTS models can be effective.

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra
components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

TL;DR: Introduces CoMuMDR, a code-mixed multi-modal multi-domain discourse parsing corpus, showing that current models struggle with it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discourse parsing datasets are limited to single-domain written English dialogues, not capturing real-world code-mixed and multi-modal conversations.

Method: Created CoMuMDR, a corpus with Hindi-English code-mixed audio and text, annotated with nine discourse relations.

Result: State-of-the-art models performed poorly on CoMuMDR, indicating challenges in handling multi-domain code-mixed data.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for better models tailored for multi-domain code-mixed discourse parsing in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Discourse parsing is an important task useful for NLU applications such as
summarization, machine comprehension, and emotion recognition. The current
discourse parsing datasets based on conversations consists of written English
dialogues restricted to a single domain. In this resource paper, we introduce
CoMuMDR: Code-mixed Multi-modal Multi-domain corpus for Discourse paRsing in
conversations. The corpus (code-mixed in Hindi and English) has both audio and
transcribed text and is annotated with nine discourse relations. We experiment
with various SoTA baseline models; the poor performance of SoTA models
highlights the challenges of multi-domain code-mixed corpus, pointing towards
the need for developing better models for such realistic settings.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reasoning is a key component of language understanding in Large Language
Models. While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit
intermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed
reasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in
latent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning
processes directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit
outputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning
embeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate
solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training
framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel
strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning
embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update
directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which
stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical
gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence. Extensive experiments and
case studies are conducted on five reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, a 5\% accuracy gain on MathQA
without additional training.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Investigating linguistic relationships on a global scale requires analyzing
diverse features such as syntax, phonology and prosody, which evolve at varying
rates influenced by internal diversification, language contact, and
sociolinguistic factors. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer
complementary alternatives to traditional historical and typological
approaches. Instead of relying on expert labor in analyzing specific linguistic
features, these new methods enable the exploration of linguistic variation
through embeddings derived directly from speech, opening new avenues for
large-scale, data-driven analyses.
  This study employs embeddings from the fine-tuned XLS-R self-supervised
language identification model voxlingua107-xls-r-300m-wav2vec, to analyze
relationships between 106 world languages based on speech recordings. Using
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), language embeddings are clustered and
compared with genealogical, lexical, and geographical distances. The results
demonstrate that embedding-based distances align closely with traditional
measures, effectively capturing both global and local typological patterns.
Challenges in visualizing relationships, particularly with hierarchical
clustering and network-based methods, highlight the dynamic nature of language
change.
  The findings show potential for scalable analyses of language variation based
on speech embeddings, providing new perspectives on relationships among
languages. By addressing methodological considerations such as corpus size and
latent space dimensionality, this approach opens avenues for studying
low-resource languages and bridging macro- and micro-level linguistic
variation. Future work aims to extend these methods to underrepresented
languages and integrate sociolinguistic variation for a more comprehensive
understanding of linguistic diversity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for use in mental
health support, yet their behavior in realistic counseling scenarios remains
largely untested. We introduce CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed
with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test LLMs in
single-turn counseling. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000
expert evaluations of responses from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and online human
therapists to real patient questions. Each response is rated along six
clinically grounded dimensions, with written rationales and span-level
annotations. We find that LLMs often outperform online human therapists in
perceived quality, but experts frequently flag their outputs for safety
concerns such as unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that
LLM judges consistently overrate model responses and overlook safety issues
identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct
CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored counseling
questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation across 2,880
responses from eight LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns.
Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for
benchmarking and improving LLM behavior in high-stakes mental health settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the observed limitation of text encoders in recognizing fine-grained entities or events within semantics, which leads to failure in dense retrieval even on simple cases.

Method: The method involves introducing a new evaluation dataset (CapRetrieval) with image captions as passages and queries about entities or events. It also includes finetuning encoders with proposed data generation strategies to enhance performance.

Result: The result shows that zero-shot evaluation reveals encoders may fail on fine-grained matching regardless of training sources or model sizes. Finetuning with the proposed strategies achieves the best performance on CapRetrieval.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that text encoders have a limitation in fine-grained recognition, and the proposed strategies improve performance, but the granularity dilemma remains a challenge.

Abstract: This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may
not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics,
resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such
behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named
CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases
inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests
that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training
sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders
with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best
performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue
of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained
salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in
this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.

TL;DR: This paper studies how MBTI personality traits affect hate speech detection in LLMs, finding significant variations in their outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection is subjective and influenced by personal traits, but the impact on LLMs isn't well understood.

Method: We conducted a human annotation survey on MBTI traits and tested four open-source LLMs with MBTI personas on three datasets.

Result: MBTI personas caused inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level biases in LLM outputs.

Conclusion: Careful definition of persona prompts is needed in LLM annotation workflows to ensure fairness and alignment with human values.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is a socially sensitive and inherently subjective task,
with judgments often varying based on personal traits. While prior work has
examined how socio-demographic factors influence annotation, the impact of
personality traits on Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored.
In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the role of persona
prompts in hate speech classification, focusing on MBTI-based traits. A human
annotation survey confirms that MBTI dimensions significantly affect labeling
behavior. Extending this to LLMs, we prompt four open-source models with MBTI
personas and evaluate their outputs across three hate speech datasets. Our
analysis uncovers substantial persona-driven variation, including
inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level
biases. These findings highlight the need to carefully define persona prompts
in LLM-based annotation workflows, with implications for fairness and alignment
with human values.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAISE, a retrieval-augmented framework for scientific reasoning that decomposes problems, generates logical queries, and retrieves relevant documents, showing superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific reasoning needs long-chain processes and domain-specific knowledge, plus adapting to new findings, which current methods may not handle well.

Method: RAISE uses three steps: problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval to find relevant documents.

Result: RAISE outperforms other baselines in scientific reasoning benchmarks by retrieving more logically relevant documents.

Conclusion: RAISE is effective for scientific reasoning as it combines problem decomposition with logically relevant document retrieval, improving over existing methods.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning requires not only long-chain reasoning processes, but
also knowledge of domain-specific terminologies and adaptation to updated
findings. To deal with these challenges for scientific reasoning, we introduce
RAISE, a step-by-step retrieval-augmented framework which retrieves logically
relevant documents from in-the-wild corpus. RAISE is divided into three steps:
problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval. We
observe that RAISE consistently outperforms other baselines on scientific
reasoning benchmarks. We analyze that unlike other baselines, RAISE retrieves
documents that are not only similar in terms of the domain knowledge, but also
documents logically more relevant.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for both open-ended and
structured tasks, yet their inference-time behavior is still largely dictated
by heuristic decoding strategies such as greedy search, sampling, or reranking.
These methods provide limited control and do not explicitly optimize for
task-specific objectives. We introduce MEMETRON, a task-agnostic framework that
formulates LLM decoding as a discrete black-box optimization problem. MEMETRON
leverages hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, GENETRON and ANNETRON, to search the
response space, guided by reward models and contextual operations performed by
the LLM itself. This approach enables efficient discovery of high-reward
responses without requiring model retraining or gradient access. The framework
is modular and generalizes across diverse tasks, requiring only a reward
function and lightweight prompt templates. We evaluate our framework on the
critical human preference alignment task and demonstrate that it significantly
outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, highlighting its potential
to improve alignment without model retraining.

TL;DR: This paper presents TableDreamer, a framework for generating table instruction tuning data that improves LLMs by addressing diversity and data efficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing LLM-based data synthesis methods in generating table instruction tuning data, which suffer from limited diversity and suboptimal data efficiency.

Method: The method involves synthesizing diverse tables and instructions as seed data, then iteratively exploring the input space guided by newly identified weakness data.

Result: Experiments show TableDreamer boosts Llama3.1-8B-instruct's average accuracy by 11.62% (49.07% to 60.69%) using 27K GPT-4o synthetic data, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with more data.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that TableDreamer effectively addresses the issues of data diversity and efficiency in table instruction tuning, demonstrating superior performance with less data.

Abstract: Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods,
they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First,
they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding
tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in
table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase
of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored
for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues.
Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as
seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under
the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as
the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments
on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62%
(49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms
state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The intestinal microbiome is a complex, low-resource biomedical domain where traditional RE methods may not be effective. Generative approaches could offer a promising alternative.

Method: The method involves using large language models for summarization to refine context, followed by instruction-tuned generation for relation extraction.

Result: Preliminary results show that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and guiding the model, but BERT-based approaches still perform better.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of generative methods in low-resource biomedical domains, suggesting further research and development could bridge the performance gap.

Abstract: We explore a generative relation extraction (RE) pipeline tailored to the
study of interactions in the intestinal microbiome, a complex and low-resource
biomedical domain. Our method leverages summarization with large language
models (LLMs) to refine context before extracting relations via
instruction-tuned generation. Preliminary results on a dedicated corpus show
that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A significant portion of the energy consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs)
arises from their inference processes; hence developing energy-efficient
methods for inference is crucial. While several techniques exist for inference
optimization, output compression remains relatively unexplored, with only a few
preliminary efforts addressing this aspect. In this work, we first benchmark 12
decoder-only LLMs across 5 datasets, revealing that these models often produce
responses that are substantially longer than necessary. We then conduct a
comprehensive quality assessment of LLM responses, formally defining six
information categories present in LLM responses. We show that LLMs often tend
to include redundant or additional information besides the minimal answer. To
address this issue of long responses by LLMs, we explore several simple and
intuitive prompt-engineering strategies. Empirical evaluation shows that
appropriate prompts targeting length reduction and controlling information
content can achieve significant energy optimization between 25-60\% by reducing
the response length while preserving the quality of LLM responses.

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking

includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons,

including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot

even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to
77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3

TL;DR: ConfPO is a new method for improving how large language models learn from human preferences by focusing on the most important tokens based on the model's confidence, without needing extra models or computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods like DPO adjust all tokens equally, which can lead to issues like overoptimization. Other methods use complex models that are hard to scale. ConfPO aims to be simpler and more efficient.

Method: ConfPO identifies preference-critical tokens using the training policy's confidence and optimizes only those tokens, using KL divergence to manage the optimization process efficiently.

Result: Experiments show ConfPO works better than uniform DAAs on tough benchmarks without extra compute.

Conclusion: ConfPO is a simple, effective way to align LLMs with human preferences, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language
Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based
solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary
models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token
probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses
optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves
alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by
using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent

raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple,

*Fariz Ikhwantri,Dusica Marijan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces EXCLAIM, an approach for compliance detection using NLI and multi-hop reasoning, and shows how LLMs can generate assurance cases for GDPR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex systems need to meet regulations, but checking assurance cases is challenging due to complex texts, need for explanations, and limited data.

Method: EXCLAIM uses NLI for multi-hop inference to check compliance, generates assurance cases with LLMs, and introduces metrics for coverage and consistency.

Result: The approach was tested with GDPR requirements, showing effectiveness in compliance detection and the potential of NLI for automation.

Conclusion: NLI-based methods like EXCLAIM can automate regulatory compliance, improving traceability and explainability.

Abstract: Ensuring complex systems meet regulations typically requires checking the
validity of assurance cases through a claim-argument-evidence framework. Some
challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and
technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to
assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on
Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with
Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the
claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference
for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited
number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models
(LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural
consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case
from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our
results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the
regulatory compliance process.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a language-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation method to create a multilingual speech emotion recognition system, achieving state-of-the-art performance in English, Finnish, and French.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a single model capable of multilingual speech emotion recognition, as extending monolingual models to multilingual systems is challenging.

Method: The method involves using Wav2Vec2.0 as the foundation for monolingual teacher models and distilling their knowledge into a unified multilingual student model.

Result: The student model achieves a weighted recall of 72.9 on English and an unweighted recall of 63.4 on Finnish, outperforming baselines. It improves recall for sad and neutral emotions but struggles with anger and happiness.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances multilingual SER, but challenges remain in recognizing certain emotions like anger and happiness across languages.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for improving human-computer
interaction. Despite strides in monolingual SER, extending them to build a
multilingual system remains challenging. Our goal is to train a single model
capable of multilingual SER by distilling knowledge from multiple teacher
models. To address this, we introduce a novel language-aware multi-teacher
knowledge distillation method to advance SER in English, Finnish, and French.
It leverages Wav2Vec2.0 as the foundation of monolingual teacher models and
then distills their knowledge into a single multilingual student model. The
student model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with a weighted recall
of 72.9 on the English dataset and an unweighted recall of 63.4 on the Finnish
dataset, surpassing fine-tuning and knowledge distillation baselines. Our
method excels in improving recall for sad and neutral emotions, although it
still faces challenges in recognizing anger and happiness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous
natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical
question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual
data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e.,
self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this
framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic
agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that
this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in
mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent
which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought)
and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each
other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become deeply embedded in everyday
life, calls to align AI development with ethical and societal values have
intensified. Interdisciplinary collaboration is often championed as a key
pathway for fostering such engagement. Yet it remains unclear whether
interdisciplinary research teams are actually leading this shift in practice.
This study analyzes over 100,000 AI-related papers published on ArXiv between
2014 and 2024 to examine how ethical values and societal concerns are
integrated into technical AI research. We develop a classifier to identify
societal content and measure the extent to which research papers express these
considerations. We find a striking shift: while interdisciplinary teams remain
more likely to produce societally-oriented research, computer science-only
teams now account for a growing share of the field's overall societal output.
These teams are increasingly integrating societal concerns into their papers
and tackling a wide range of domains - from fairness and safety to healthcare
and misinformation. These findings challenge common assumptions about the
drivers of societal AI and raise important questions. First, what are the
implications for emerging understandings of AI safety and governance if most
societally-oriented research is being undertaken by exclusively technical
teams? Second, for scholars in the social sciences and humanities: in a
technical field increasingly responsive to societal demands, what distinctive
perspectives can we still offer to help shape the future of AI?

Motivation: To develop in-house LLM solutions that meet cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards in nuclear operations, which are critical for handling sensitive information and ensuring domain-specific accuracy.

Method: Building a compact Transformer-based model using the Essential CANDU textbook dataset, trained on a single GPU to maintain data security, with a focus on nuclear content to avoid external data risks.

Result: The model captures specialized nuclear vocabulary but has issues with syntactic coherence. Early text generation successes indicate utility for specific tasks, yet limitations in dataset size and preprocessing are evident.

Conclusion: The approach proves feasible for secure, domain-specific LLMs in nuclear applications. Future work involves expanding the dataset, improving tokenization, and evaluating real-world readiness.

Abstract: This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear
applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook.
Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a
single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations.
Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of
capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes
lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this
approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with
rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in
text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while
also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing,
and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions
include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining
tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's
readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.

Method: The paper proposes using synthetic data generation to transform existing text data into usable Q&A pairs, leveraging LLMs to analyze text, extract key information, generate questions, and evaluate dataset quality.

Result: Synthetic data can unlock LLM potential in the nuclear industry, leading to improved information retrieval, knowledge sharing, and decision-making.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation is a viable solution for overcoming data challenges in the nuclear sector, enabling robust LLM applications without compromising privacy.

Abstract: The nuclear industry possesses a wealth of valuable information locked away

Conclusion: In-context learning can be effectively applied to dialogue state tracking, and the selected factors and methods contribute to understanding and improving DST performance with LLMs.

Abstract: This study explores the application of in-context learning (ICL) to the

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieving operational data from nuclear power plants requires exceptional
accuracy and transparency due to the criticality of the decisions it supports.
Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been
explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses
significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and
legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured --
complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These
challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the
approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging
function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.
Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved,
purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed
by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid
approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by
ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before
deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and
maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist
in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on
validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison
between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach,
highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work
underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational
safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in
critical systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning

benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis
on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP
tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on
datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for
linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments
reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context
examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification
tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection
from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures
outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on
complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning
yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The extraction of information about traffic accidents from legal documents is
crucial for quantifying insurance company costs. Extracting entities such as
percentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved
compensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the
subtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is
proposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant
segments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two
methodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a
second approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are
then vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches
(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models
(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to
the selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning
is performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a
significant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important
contention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these
hallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The
performance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent
use of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an
accuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning
achieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%.
Notably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned
LLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model
development. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.

Abstract: Swiss German is a low-resource language represented by diverse dialects that
differ significantly from Standard German and from each other, lacking a
standardized written form. As a result, transcribing Swiss German involves
translating into Standard German. Existing datasets have been collected in
controlled environments, yielding effective speech-to-text (STT) models, but
these models struggle with spontaneous conversational speech.
  This paper, therefore, introduces the new SRB-300 dataset, a 300-hour
annotated speech corpus featuring real-world long-audio recordings from 39
Swiss German radio and TV stations. It captures spontaneous speech across all
major Swiss dialects recorded in various realistic environments and overcomes
the limitation of prior sentence-level corpora.
  We fine-tuned multiple OpenAI Whisper models on the SRB-300 dataset,
achieving notable enhancements over previous zero-shot performance metrics.
Improvements in word error rate (WER) ranged from 19% to 33%, while BLEU scores
increased between 8% and 40%. The best fine-tuned model, large-v3, achieved a
WER of 17.1% and a BLEU score of 74.8. This advancement is crucial for
developing effective and robust STT systems for Swiss German and other
low-resource languages in real-world contexts.

Abstract: Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses
can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial
prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe
representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface
level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to
the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated
adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts
across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families.
Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates
(ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying
vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where
adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate
this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware
Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning
with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent
separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion
among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled
embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry
without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.
Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent
alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when
unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens
into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available

this work, we present PlantBert, a high-performance, open-source language model
specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant
stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its
disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantBert is fine-tuned
on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary
focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic
stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with
rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity
normalization, enabling PlantBert to capture biologically meaningful
relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is
annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology,
encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of
plant adaptation. PlantBert exhibits strong generalization capabilities across
entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in
low-resource scientific fields. By providing a scalable and reproducible
framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantBert bridges a critical
gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems
in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is

Abstract: Natural language understanding systems struggle with low-resource languages,

We implement our method for Greek dialects and apply it on a dataset of
regional proverbs, evaluating the outputs using human annotators. We then use
this dataset to conduct downstream experiments, finding that previous results
regarding these proverbs relied solely on superficial linguistic information,
including orthographic artifacts, while new observations can still be made

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject

for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify
gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to
propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that
gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop
questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the
RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop
questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We
further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the
generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along
relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still
outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the
performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating
knowledge to a wide range of relations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating
outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it
with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases
of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s
parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict
context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding
strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve
faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which
undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of
misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a
novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling
discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context.
Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level
and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and
integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is

Method: Examining LLMs' responses to direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that assume misinformation, considering their knowledge level and political bias.

Result: LLMs have significant challenges in grounding and rejecting false user beliefs.

Conclusion: The study raises concerns about LLMs' effectiveness in mitigating misinformation in political contexts.

Abstract: Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing
interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect
knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper
investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases
where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain
where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the
ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that
presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to
engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to
their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight
significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false
user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in
political discourse.

*Marek Kadlčík,Michal Štefánik,Timothee Mickus,Michal Spiegel,Josef Kuchař*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses arithmetic errors in pretrained language models by proposing a new probing technique that accurately decodes numeric values from embeddings, showing that LMs have precise number representations post-pre-training and that aligning embeddings can reduce errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained language models make arithmetic errors, and existing methods for probing numeric values in their representations have limited success, suggesting that distributional embeddings are unreliable for exact quantities. The paper aims to develop a better probing method to address this issue.

Method: The authors propose a novel probing technique to decode numeric values from input embeddings, achieving near-perfect accuracy across various open-source LMs.

Result: The new probing method successfully decodes numeric values with high accuracy, demonstrating that LMs have precise number representations after pre-training. The embeddings' precision correlates with arithmetic errors, and aligning them based on the discovered pattern reduces these errors.

Conclusion: Pretrained language models can represent numbers precisely, and improving their number embeddings through alignment can significantly mitigate arithmetic errors.

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing
work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models'
representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent
unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact
quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate
for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal
patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values
from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source
LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with
remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged
by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary
arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered
by our probe can mitigate these errors.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been
developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work
has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks
and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to
compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This
work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile
agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,
Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in
20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online
Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates
with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a
range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that
UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents
generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting
representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and
attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.
Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient
scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS
extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing
long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS
achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on
compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without
significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code

Abstract: Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and
slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and
significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has
suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In
this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for
this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented
Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning
classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and
demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under
the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as
NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test).
Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected
by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with
language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal
gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the
naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related
cognitive decline and NCD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in speech technology systems for child speech due to limited training data and the complexity of child vocalizations.

Method: The method involves creating the SpeechMaturity dataset and training transformer models to classify child vocalizations into categories like cry, laughter, mature, and immature speech.

Result: The models trained on SpeechMaturity outperform previous state-of-the-art models, achieve human-level accuracy, and are robust in different settings.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that SpeechMaturity provides a significant improvement for child speech classification tasks, enabling better performance in downstream applications.

Abstract: Speech technology systems struggle with many downstream tasks for child
speech due to small training corpora and the difficulties that child speech
pose. We apply a novel dataset, SpeechMaturity, to state-of-the-art transformer
models to address a fundamental classification task: identifying child
vocalizations. Unlike previous corpora, our dataset captures maximally
ecologically-valid child vocalizations across an unprecedented sample,
comprising children acquiring 25+ languages in the U.S., Bolivia, Vanuatu,
Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and France. The dataset contains 242,004
labeled vocalizations, magnitudes larger than previous work. Models were
trained to distinguish between cry, laughter, mature (consonant+vowel), and
immature speech (just consonant or vowel). Models trained on the dataset
outperform state-of-the-art models trained on previous datasets, achieved
classification accuracy comparable to humans, and were robust across rural and
urban settings.

Abstract: We introduce **SWE-Flow**, a novel data synthesis framework grounded in
Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike existing software engineering data that
rely on human-submitted issues, **SWE-Flow** automatically infers incremental
development steps directly from unit tests, which inherently encapsulate
high-level requirements. The core of **SWE-Flow** is the construction of a
Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG), which precisely captures function interactions,
enabling the generation of a structured, step-by-step *development schedule*.
At each step, **SWE-Flow** produces a partial codebase, the corresponding unit
tests, and the necessary code modifications, resulting in fully verifiable TDD
tasks. With this approach, we generated 16,061 training instances and 2,020
test instances from real-world GitHub projects, creating the **SWE-Flow-Eval**
benchmark. Our experiments show that fine-tuning open model on this dataset
significantly improves performance in TDD-based coding. To facilitate further
research, we release all code, datasets, models, and Docker images at
[Github](https://github.com/Hambaobao/SWE-Flow).

Motivation: To improve the consistency and accuracy of morphosyntactic analysis in L2-Korean by addressing the challenges of limited annotated data.

Method: Developed a semi-automated framework to map XPOS to UPOS, expanded the L2-Korean corpus with 2,998 new sentences, and evaluated NLP models with and without XPOS-UPOS alignments.

Result: Aligned datasets improved consistency andmorphosyntactic tagging/parsing accuracy, especially with limited data.

Conclusion: The semi-automated framework and expanded corpus enhance L2-Korean NLP tasks, suggesting that XPOS-UPOS alignment is beneficial for accuracy in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: The present study extends recent work on Universal Dependencies annotations
for second-language (L2) Korean by introducing a semi-automated framework that
identifies morphosyntactic constructions from XPOS sequences and aligns those
constructions with corresponding UPOS categories. We also broaden the existing
L2-Korean corpus by annotating 2,998 new sentences from argumentative essays.
To evaluate the impact of XPOS-UPOS alignments, we fine-tune L2-Korean
morphosyntactic analysis models on datasets both with and without these
alignments, using two NLP toolkits. Our results indicate that the aligned
dataset not only improves consistency across annotation layers but also
enhances morphosyntactic tagging and dependency-parsing accuracy, particularly
in cases of limited annotated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the performance of large language models by scaling test-time compute through a new method of aggregating multiple answers.

Method: The method involves training a compact LLM called SSA that takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and outputs the final answer, optimized for accuracy using reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments show that SSA outperforms other test-time scaling methods like reward model-based re-ranking and demonstrates strong generalization across various sample sizes, model families, scales, and tasks.

Conclusion: The approach of separating answer generation and aggregation with SSA allows efficient use of black box models and offers significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large
language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically
aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using
verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in
math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple
sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that
takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer,
optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments
on multiple reasoning datasets show that SSA outperforms other test-time
scaling methods such as reward model-based re-ranking. Our approach also shows
a promising generalization ability, across sample set sizes, base model
families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs
to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the
outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.

Motivation: To evaluate how human and LLM proofreading affect the intelligibility of second language writings and check the consistency of LLM outcomes.

Method: Examining lexical and syntactic interventions in identical second language writings by humans and three LLMs (ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b).

Result: Both human and LLM proofreading improve bigram lexical features, but LLMs make more extensive rework in vocabulary and sentence structures, using diverse vocabulary and more adjective modifiers.

Conclusion: LLM proofreading is effective in enhancing intelligibility with consistent outcomes across models, suggesting potential for reliable use in language correction tasks.

Abstract: This study examines the lexical and syntactic interventions of human and LLM
proofreading aimed at improving overall intelligibility in identical second
language writings, and evaluates the consistency of outcomes across three LLMs
(ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b). Findings show that both human and
LLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to
better coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However,
LLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking
vocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and
sophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective
modifiers in noun phrases. The proofreading outcomes are highly consistent in
major lexical and syntactic features across the three models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the
development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.
However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one
mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),
which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the
complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present
\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that
formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.
Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its
reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with
"route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into
its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based
reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost
reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway
toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions
only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example
performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.
Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1
outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while
maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions
on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher
accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a
text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the
\textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different
modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between
modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences
lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a
text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they
become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations
only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence
subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual
data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with
multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the
performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on
the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach
for reducing it.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models in
external evidence, yet it still falters when answers must be pieced together
across semantically distant documents. We close this gap with the Hierarchical
Lexical Graph (HLG), a three-tier index that (i) traces every atomic
proposition to its source, (ii) clusters propositions into latent topics, and
(iii) links entities and relations to expose cross-document paths. On top of
HLG we build two complementary, plug-and-play retrievers: StatementGraphRAG,
which performs fine-grained entity-aware beam search over propositions for
high-precision factoid questions, and TopicGraphRAG, which selects coarse
topics before expanding along entity links to supply broad yet relevant context
for exploratory queries. Additionally, existing benchmarks lack the complexity
required to rigorously evaluate multi-hop summarization systems, often focusing
on single-document queries or limited datasets. To address this, we introduce a
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that curates realistic, multi-document
question-answer pairs, enabling robust evaluation of multi-hop retrieval
systems. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that our
methods outperform naive chunk-based RAG achieving an average relative
improvement of 23.1% in retrieval recall and correctness. Open-source Python

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially advanced the field of

To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with
GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties
and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an
in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature
initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their
performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple
recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we
demonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly
improves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender
systems for the Linked Open Data cloud. The code and data are available on our

Abstract: Different machine learning models can represent the same underlying concept
in different ways. This variability is particularly valuable for in-the-wild
multimodal retrieval, where the objective is to identify the corresponding
representation in one modality given another modality as input. This challenge
can be effectively framed as a feature alignment problem. For example, given a
sentence encoded by a language model, retrieve the most semantically aligned
image based on features produced by an image encoder, or vice versa. In this
work, we first investigate the geometric relationships between visual and
textual embeddings derived from both vision-language models and combined
unimodal models. We then align these representations using four standard
similarity metrics as well as two learned ones, implemented via neural
networks. Our findings indicate that the Wasserstein distance can serve as an
informative measure of the modality gap, while cosine similarity consistently
outperforms alternative metrics in feature alignment tasks. Furthermore, we
observe that conventional architectures such as multilayer perceptrons are
insufficient for capturing the complex interactions between image and text
representations. Our study offers novel insights and practical considerations
for researchers working in multimodal information retrieval, particularly in
real-world, cross-modal applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GradEscape, the first gradient-based evader
designed to attack AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors. GradEscape overcomes the
undifferentiable computation problem, caused by the discrete nature of text, by
introducing a novel approach to construct weighted embeddings for the detector
input. It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim
detectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To
address the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we
introduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to
detectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel
tokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective
evasion even in query-only access.
  We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language
models, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders.
Experimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders
in various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing
only 139M parameters. We have successfully applied GradEscape to two real-world
commercial AIGT detectors. Our analysis reveals that the primary vulnerability
stems from disparity in text expression styles within the training data. We
also propose a potential defense strategy to mitigate the threat of AIGT
evaders. We open-source our GradEscape for developing more robust AIGT
detectors.

Abstract: Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
rapidly being adopted across industry, academia, and government sectors, owing
to their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However,
despite their strengths, the inconsistency and unpredictability of LLM outputs
present substantial challenges, especially in security-critical domains such as
access control. One critical issue that emerges prominently is the consistency
of LLM-generated responses, which is paramount for ensuring secure and reliable
operations.
  In this paper, we study the application of LLMs within the context of
Cybersecurity Access Control Systems. Specifically, we investigate the
consistency and accuracy of LLM-generated password policies, translating
natural language prompts into executable pwquality.conf configuration files.
Our experimental methodology adopts two distinct approaches: firstly, we
utilize pre-trained LLMs to generate configuration files purely from natural
language prompts without additional guidance. Secondly, we provide these models
with official pwquality.conf documentation to serve as an informative baseline.
We systematically assess the soundness, accuracy, and consistency of these
AI-generated configurations. Our findings underscore significant challenges in
the current generation of LLMs and contribute valuable insights into refining
the deployment of LLMs in Access Control Systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model
(LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks
during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be
manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific
triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we
present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on
LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies
among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing
on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential
backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the
agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the
agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought
trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and

ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation
tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly deployed in graph-related
applications, making ownership verification critical to protect their
intellectual property against model theft. Fingerprinting and black-box
watermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining
model similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership
collisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning.
The latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of
backdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do
not convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires
a unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the
suspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost
and the risk of detection.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box
watermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as
the ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight
we term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the
difference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two
connected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple
selected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information
without introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE
is evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along
with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that WGLE achieves 100%
ownership verification accuracy, an average fidelity degradation of 0.85%,
comparable robustness against potential attacks, and low embedding overhead.
The code is available in the repository.

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science,
accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and
pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to
the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the
need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and
validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework
powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to
streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science
workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for
accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models
(LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific
reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform
tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry
optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with
methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials
to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate
ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs
(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,
while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.
Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks
through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed
GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

Abstract: Central to the artificial life endeavour is the creation of artificial
systems spontaneously generating properties found in the living world such as
autopoiesis, self-replication, evolution and open-endedness. While numerous
models and paradigms have been proposed, cellular automata (CA) have taken a
very important place in the field notably as they enable the study of
phenomenons like self-reproduction and autopoiesis. Continuous CA like Lenia
have been showed to produce life-like patterns reminiscent, on an aesthetic and
ontological point of view, of biological organisms we call creatures. We
propose in this paper Flow-Lenia, a mass conservative extension of Lenia. We
present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in generating
spatially-localized patters (SLPs) with complex behaviors and show that the
update rule parameters can be optimized to generate complex creatures showing
behaviors of interest. Furthermore, we show that Flow-Lenia allows us to embed
the parameters of the model, defining the properties of the emerging patterns,
within its own dynamics thus allowing for multispecies simulations. By using
the evolutionary activity framework as well as other metrics, we shed light on
the emergent evolutionary dynamics taking place in this system.

Abstract: Caco-2 permeability serves as a critical in vitro indicator for predicting
the oral absorption of drug candidates during early-stage drug discovery. To
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions, we
systematically investigated the impact of eight molecular feature
representation types including 2D/3D descriptors, structural fingerprints, and
deep learning-based embeddings combined with automated machine learning
techniques to predict Caco-2 permeability. Using two datasets of differing
scale and diversity (TDC benchmark and curated OCHEM data), we assessed model
performance across representations and identified PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit
descriptors as particularly effective for Caco-2 prediction. Notably, the
AutoML-based model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE performance. Furthermore,
for both PaDEL and Mordred representations, the incorporation of 3D descriptors
resulted in a 15.73% reduction in MAE compared to using 2D features alone, as
confirmed by feature importance analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AutoML approaches in ADMET modeling and offer practical
guidance for feature selection in data-limited prediction tasks.

Abstract: Financial analysis presents complex challenges that could leverage large

financial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic
innovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible
research resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in
this specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an
open-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance
of LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection,
earnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by
downloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic
Disclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels
corresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic
regression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings
forecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to
real-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific
adaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is
publicly available to facilitate future research in finance with LLMs.

Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems.
Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the
flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have
recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have
demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss
function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the
corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex
equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet
accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function
using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel
Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that
KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical
experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations
effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for
improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific
computing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body
systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to
the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size.
Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously
output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in
an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum
excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the
states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate,
through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all
interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing
multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition,
we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting
trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying
all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited
states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states,
which closely match recent experimental observations that the
quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical
ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law
decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap
scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and
efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum
many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking
quantum devices to photoisomerization.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing
(NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for
Quantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce
the vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While
large-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical
quantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as
passwords is not. Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many
applications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic
threat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently
been investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel,
realistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility
of adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study
different encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum
Independent Set (UD-MIS) problems. Our approach allows us to estimate the token
distribution from data and adiabatically prepare a quantum state from which we
eventually sample the generated passwords via measurements. Our results show
that relatively small samples of 128 passwords, generated on the QuEra Aquila
256-qubit neutral atom quantum computer, contain human-like passwords such as
"Tunas200992" or "teedem28iglove".

Motivation: The motivation is to recall the lesser-known property of LS estimators in linear regression equations with intervally excited regressors, emphasizing their finite convergence time under the IE assumption.

Method: The method involves analyzing linear regression equations with intervally excited regressors using standard Least Square parameter estimators.

Result: The result shows that LS estimators ensure finite convergence time equal to the duration needed for the IE assumption to be satisfied.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that LS estimators are effective for parameter estimation in LRE under the IE assumption, which is the minimal requirement for identifiability.

Abstract: In this brief note we recall the little-known fact that, for linear
regression equations (LRE) with intervally excited (IE) regressors, standard
Least Square (LS) parameter estimators ensure finite convergence time (FCT) of
the estimated parameters. The convergence time being equal to the time length
needed to comply with the IE assumption. As is well-known, IE is necessary and
sufficient for the identifiability of the LRE-hence, it is the weakest
assumption for the on-or off-line solution of the parameter estimation problem.

Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate

Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies
involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific
template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require
non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and
near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design
exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a
target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound
single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional
distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent
``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent
physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional
dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate
DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in
design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better
fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.

Abstract: Research in neuroscience and vision science relies heavily on careful
measurements of animal subject's gaze direction. Rodents are the most widely
studied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage
and hardiness. Recently, video based eye trackers that use image processing
techniques have become a popular option for gaze tracking because they are easy
to use and are completely noninvasive. Although significant progress has been
made in improving the accuracy and robustness of eye tracking algorithms,
unfortunately, almost all of the techniques have focused on human eyes, which
does not account for the unique characteristics of the rodent eye images, e.g.,
variability in eye parameters, abundance of surrounding hair, and their small

identification in rodent gaze determination that can be incrementally trained
to account for variability in eye parameters encountered in the field. To the

Result: The method achieves significant improvements in spatial accuracy and mesh quality, with no need for additional training labels.

Conclusion: The generated meshes are versatile and useful for solid mechanics simulations across different software platforms.

Abstract: High-quality volumetric meshing from medical images is a key bottleneck for

unrealistic inter-part distances. In this study, we introduce a simple yet

optimization, which combines fast initial shape fitting with more detailed
sample-specific mesh corrections. Our method provides significant improvements
in both spatial accuracy and mesh quality, while being fully automated and

Result: DCD achieves precise and robust segmentation of key anatomical structures in fetal A4C views, enhancing prenatal cardiac assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed DCD model effectively addresses segmentation challenges in fetal echocardiography, reducing workload and improving accuracy for better prenatal evaluation of CHD.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber

Abstract: Accurate classification of second-trimester fetal ultrasound images remains

biologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework that-unlike prior
studies focused on only a handful of anatomical targets-simultaneously
distinguishes 16 fetal structures. Drawing on the hierarchical, modular
organization of biological vision systems, our model stacks two complementary
branches (a "shallow" path for coarse, low-resolution cues and a "detailed"
path for fine, high-resolution features), concatenating their outputs for final
prediction. To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large
number of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture. We trained and
evaluated on 5,298 routinely acquired clinical images (annotated by three
experts and reconciled via Dawid-Skene), reflecting real-world noise and
variability rather than a "cleaned" dataset. Despite this complexity, our
ensemble (EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss) identifies
90% of organs with accuracy > 0.75 and 75% of organs with accuracy >
0.85-performance competitive with more elaborate models applied to far fewer

Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast
cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying
abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse
datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical
constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle
mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate
full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in
realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and
none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture
fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates
separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level)
contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based
model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design
enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840
pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of
classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both
numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image
generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential
to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT has high resolution but artifacts, while CT is better. sCT translates CBCT to CT domain, but needs improvement.

Method: Multimodal learning integrating CBCT and CT data, using real and synthetic datasets to analyze alignment and quality impact.

Result: Multimodal sCT outperforms unimodal baselines, especially in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and reproducible in real clinical datasets.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for real-time
intraoperative imaging due to its low radiation dose and high acquisition
speed. However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant
artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed
Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we
enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative
CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use
a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT
quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT
consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains
observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate
that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.

Abstract: Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that
run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite
rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance
regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query
rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite
rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques
cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts
exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and
reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL
queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly
applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address
this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and
feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into
semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a
broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based
methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite
state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and
enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we
develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate
optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection
technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive
experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over
state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior
methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly being deployed to perform autonomous
data analyses. However, their data awareness -- the ability to recognize,
reason over, and appropriately handle data artifacts such as missing values,
outliers, and logical inconsistencies -- remains underexplored. These artifacts
are especially common in real-world tabular data and, if mishandled, can
significantly compromise the validity of analytical conclusions. To address
this gap, we present RADAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating
data-aware reasoning on tabular data. We develop a framework to simulate data
artifacts via programmatic perturbations to enable targeted evaluation of model
behavior. RADAR comprises 2980 table query pairs, grounded in real-world data
spanning 9 domains and 5 data artifact types. In addition to evaluating
artifact handling, RADAR systematically varies table size to study how
reasoning performance holds when increasing table size. Our evaluation reveals
that, despite decent performance on tables without data artifacts, frontier
models degrade significantly when data artifacts are introduced, exposing
critical gaps in their capacity for robust, data-aware analysis. Designed to be
flexible and extensible, RADAR supports diverse perturbation types and
controllable table sizes, offering a valuable resource for advancing tabular
reasoning.

platforms. This work presents PARV-CE, a SIMD-enabled, multi-precision MAC
engine that performs efficient multiply-accumulate operations using a unified
data-path for 4/8/16-bit fixed-point, floating point, and posit formats. The
architecture incorporates a layer adaptive precision strategy to align
computational accuracy with workload sensitivity, optimizing both performance

reconfigurable SIMD pipeline, enabling high-throughput processing with minimal
overhead through hardware-software co-design. The results demonstrate up to 2x
improvement in PDP and 3x reduction in resource usage compared to SoTA designs,
while retaining accuracy within 1.8% FP32 baseline. The architecture supports
both on-device training and inference across a range of workloads, including
DNNs, RNNs, RL, and Transformer models. The empirical analysis establish PARVCE

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently
emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However,
existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted
interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and
constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas
construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of
semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement
Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By
formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost
jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified
probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives
pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and
novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we
propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy
that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise
rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven
framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive
baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep speech classification tasks, including keyword spotting and speaker
verification, are vital in speech-based human-computer interaction. Recently,
the security of these technologies has been revealed to be susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Specifically, attackers use noisy disruption triggers and
speech element triggers to produce poisoned speech samples that train models to
become vulnerable. However, these methods typically create only a limited
number of backdoors due to the inherent constraints of the trigger function. In
this paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on
speech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large
Language Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers. Increasing the number of
triggers may disproportionately elevate the poisoning rate, resulting in higher
attack costs and a lower success rate per trigger. We introduce the Multiple
Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) as a mitigation strategy to address this
challenge. The proposed attack is called the Speech Prompt Backdoor Attack
(SPBA). Building on this foundation, we conducted attack experiments on two
speech classification tasks, demonstrating that SPBA shows significant trigger
effectiveness and achieves exceptional performance in attack metrics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of deep-learning methods generating a target
vital sign waveform from a source vital sign waveform, most existing models are
designed exclusively for a specific source-to-target pair. This requires
distinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing
pipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical
settings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional
Vital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any
target waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or
arterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single
model. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin
Transformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture
distinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct
multi-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our
framework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average
across all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and
improving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the
generated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical
Instrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British
Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By
eliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe
that this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital
sign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits
their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless
audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully
end-to-end LALM designed for Audio Query-Audio Answer (AQAA) tasks. The model
integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature
extraction, a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM and a neural vocoder for
high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved
token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance.
Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that
Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the
state-of-art LALMs in key areas. This work contributes a promising solution for
end-to-end LALMs and highlights the critical role of token-based vocoder in
enhancing overall performance for AQAA tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and

focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath
effect, and spatial relationships. To overcome data scarcity, ACORN introduce a
physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled
physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we
build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an
audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By
connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate
reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as
line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival
estimation, paving the way for enabling LLMs to understand physical world.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize
high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to
fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA)
systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets,
modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates
efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most
influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important,
in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a
systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into
associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future
text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably
most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional
Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from
scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone
architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including
generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability,
adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing
capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds
light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing
actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions
in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation. Audio sampled examples

Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain
alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus
settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to
generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.
However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily
focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal
models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain
alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity
recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with
audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized
instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned
MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that
instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned
multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for
both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear
disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise
differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find
that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas
showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and
language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide
clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the
alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping
joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly
available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

{\it CALL}, \underline{C}ommunic\underline{a}tive Wor\underline{l}d
Mode\underline{l}, for MARL, where 1) each agent first learns its world model
that encodes its state and intention into low-dimensional latent representation
with smaller memory footprint, which can be shared with other agents of
interest via lightweight communication; and 2) each agent carries out
ego-centric learning while exploiting lightweight information sharing to enrich
her world model, and then exploits its generalization capacity to improve
prediction for better planning. We characterize the gain on the prediction
accuracy from the information sharing and its impact on performance gap.
Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging local trajectory
planning tasks in the CARLA platform to demonstrate the performance gains of

Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom,
such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for
real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion
planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a
computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and
constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and
robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation
to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and
design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based
simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate
that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates
in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes
whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.

Conclusion: The diffusion model offers a practical approach for safety validation in autonomous driving, particularly for traffic intersections, by generating failure cases without relying on external data or prior knowledge.

Abstract: Safety validation of autonomous driving systems is extremely challenging due

benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning

relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block
tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three
key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness.
We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and
limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings
indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in
high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in
performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals
persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning.
Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements,
suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We
position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging

Abstract: Limb loss affects millions globally, impairing physical function and reducing
quality of life. Most traditional surface electromyographic (sEMG) and
semi-autonomous methods require users to generate myoelectric signals for each
control, imposing physically and mentally taxing demands. This study aims to
develop a fully autonomous control system that enables a prosthetic hand to
automatically grasp and release objects of various shapes using only a camera
attached to the wrist. By placing the hand near an object, the system will
automatically execute grasping actions with a proper grip force in response to
the hand's movements and the environment. To release the object being grasped,
just naturally place the object close to the table and the system will
automatically open the hand. Such a system would provide individuals with limb
loss with a very easy-to-use prosthetic control interface and greatly reduce
mental effort while using. To achieve this goal, we developed a teleoperation
system to collect human demonstration data for training the prosthetic hand
control model using imitation learning, which mimics the prosthetic hand
actions from human. Through training the model using only a few objects' data
from one single participant, we have shown that the imitation learning
algorithm can achieve high success rates, generalizing to more individuals and
unseen objects with a variation of weights. The demonstrations are available at

Abstract: Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in
robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action
distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits
their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue,
existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative
modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques
originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major
distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent
samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves
generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal
coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation,
we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency
consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the
action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting
efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency
consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action
features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting
convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In
addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal
variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53
tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing
one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the
vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance
degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and
effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency
93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.

### [257] [On Limiting Probability Distributions of Higher Order Markov Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08874)
*Lixing Han,Jianhong Xu*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: This paper provides a sufficient condition for the existence of the limiting probability distribution of a higher-order Markov chain based on the regularity of its transition tensor, extending previous results from first-order chains and offering a more direct approach than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the long-term behavior of higher-order Markov chains by establishing a sufficient condition for their limiting probability distribution, which is crucial for analyzing such systems.

Method: The method involves analyzing the regularity of the transition tensor to derive a sufficient condition for the existence of the limiting distribution.

Result: The result is a sufficient condition for the existence of the limiting probability distribution of a higher-order Markov chain based on transition tensor regularity.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the established condition extends previous findings for first-order chains and provides a more direct approach compared to existing methods for higher-order chains.

Abstract: The limiting (or stationary) probability distribution is one of the key
characteristics of a Markov chain since it shows its long-term behavior. In
this paper, for a higher order Markov chain, we establish a sufficient
condition for the existence of its limiting probability distribution. This
condition is built upon the regularity of its transition tensor. Our results
extend the corresponding conclusions for first order chains. Besides, they
complement the existing results concerning higher order chains that rely on
approximation schemes or two-phase power iterations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of
a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local
microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based
spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective
kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing
switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to
automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework
efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations
and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect
distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects
abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto
physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and
proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning,
but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching
phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach
provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex,
non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in
molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging
modalities.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions
from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to
the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across
multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying
physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We
introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S
forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection
awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical
Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto
spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which
explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable
frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical
global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns
into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and
operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements
for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter
temperature compared to previous best models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world high-dimensional CPD is challenging due to complex data patterns and violated assumptions, while standalone deep networks have limitations. Ensembling offers better performance but standard aggregation methods like averaging are suboptimal.

Method: Propose WWAggr, an ensemble aggregation method based on Wasserstein distance, which is task-specific and more effective than traditional techniques like averaging. Also address the decision threshold selection problem in CPD.

Result: WWAggr works effectively with various deep CPD ensembles and provides improved performance over standard aggregation methods. It also solves the long-standing issue of decision threshold selection in CPD.

Conclusion: Ensembles of deep change point detectors can be enhanced with task-specific aggregation methods like WWAggr, leading to more robust solutions and better handling of real-world data challenges.

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) aims to identify moments of abrupt distribution
shifts in data streams. Real-world high-dimensional CPD remains challenging due
to data pattern complexity and violation of common assumptions. Resorting to
standalone deep neural networks, the current state-of-the-art detectors have
yet to achieve perfect quality. Concurrently, ensembling provides more robust
solutions, boosting the performance. In this paper, we investigate ensembles of
deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation
techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem
peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific
method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure
is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models.
Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing
problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.

Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student

include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data
are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio
capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and
behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI,
synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as
posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others.
Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and
engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own
evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and
AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based

Abstract: A new extended version of the altiro3D C++ Library -- initially developed to
get glass-free holographic displays starting from 2D images -- is here
introduced aiming to deal with 3D video streams from either 2D webcam images or
flat video files. These streams are processed in real-time to synthesize
light-fields (in Native format) and feed realistic 3D experiences. The core
function needed to recreate multiviews consists on the use of MiDaS
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which allows to extract a depth map from a
single 2D image. Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing techniques are applied
to improve the overall performance of the extended altiro3D Library. Thus,
altiro3D can now treat standard images, video streams or screen portions of a
Desktop where other apps may be also running (like web browsers, video chats,
etc) and render them into 3D. To achieve the latter, a screen region need to be
selected in order to feed the output directly into a light-field 3D device such

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Understanding their
kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in
embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured
data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and
generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction
of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a
hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an
articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this
setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and
there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers
joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD
video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$
larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11
categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video
as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real
articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos,
outperforming existing methods significantly.

Motivation: Modeling light's full properties (amplitude and phase) in 3D is essential for physically plausible rendering, especially in holography. Current methods use intensity-based intermediaries, which are computationally costly.

Method: The authors propose a reformulation of 3D Gaussian splatting with complex-valued Gaussian primitives, using RGBD multi-view images to directly optimize 3D holographic scenes.

Result: The method achieves 30x-10,000x speed improvements over existing approaches while maintaining comparable image quality.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step forward in creating geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene representations.

Abstract: Modeling the full properties of light, including both amplitude and phase, in
3D representations is crucial for advancing physically plausible rendering,
particularly in holographic displays. To support these features, we propose a
novel representation that optimizes 3D scenes without relying on
intensity-based intermediaries. We reformulate 3D Gaussian splatting with
complex-valued Gaussian primitives, expanding support for rendering with light

complex-valued Gaussians as a 3D holographic scene representation. This
eliminates the need for computationally expensive hologram re-optimization.
Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 30x-10,000x speed

Motivation: Material selection in images is crucial for efficient editing, but existing methods struggle with lighting and reflectance variations. The need for a more reliable approach that supports detailed editing at multiple levels motivates this work.

Method: The authors use vision transformer (ViT) models to extract features for material selection. They propose a multi-resolution processing strategy to improve selection accuracy and stability. Additionally, they create the DuMaS dataset with dense annotations for texture and subtexture levels.

Result: The method achieves finer and more stable material selection results compared to prior approaches, validated on the DuMaS dataset with extensive annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed method and dataset contribute to more accurate and versatile material selection in image editing, supporting advanced downstream tasks with detailed texture and subtexture information.

Abstract: Selection is the first step in many image editing processes, enabling faster
and simpler modifications of all pixels sharing a common modality. In this
work, we present a method for material selection in images, robust to lighting

rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for
selection, proposing a multi-resolution processing strategy that yields finer

selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level
material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over
800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially
private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in
some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular
data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the
convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's
behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a
new theoretical framework to explain PE's practical behavior and identify
sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive
datasets with $n$ data points from a bounded domain, we prove that PE produces
an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein
distance of order $\tilde{O}(d(n\epsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original,
establishing worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our
analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the
Private Signed Measure Mechanism, a method for DP synthetic data generation
that has thus far not seen much practical adoption. We demonstrate the
practical relevance of our theoretical findings in simulations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models
trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase.
However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In
this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear
regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional
linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass
SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has
a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior
with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show
that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$,
where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting,
one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see
e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse
(i.e., choosing $L>N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are
also provided to verify our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of
Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in
resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the
memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on
static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize
critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput
tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method
for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to
evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model
loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision
quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers
while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable
balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic
long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV
pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving
high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix
provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize
computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves
near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization
configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x
memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain
samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge
transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier
classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label
distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights
can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient
exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the
inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle
these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model
to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a
unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between
sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level
transport provides essential structure information for the class-level
knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative
information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan
provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware
transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation
formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been
significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent
preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality
imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual
inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes
hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs
do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model
(LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on
offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to
dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified
rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM
alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,
Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality
imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset
by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due
to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of
input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended
tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed
to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging
vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance GPU efficiency through precision scaling during LLM pre-training while maintaining accuracy, leveraging NVIDIA's MX formats for finer control over tensor quantization.

Method: The paper investigates the impact of rounding modes in MX formats, specifically comparing the OCP specification's rounding mode to an improved one using round-to-infinity, to address convergence issues in pre-training LLMs on large datasets.

Result: The improved rounding mode with round-to-infinity allows successful pre-training of an 8B model on 15T tokens using MXFP8, avoiding divergence that occurs with the OCP-suggested rounding mode.

Conclusion: The study concludes that careful selection of rounding modes is critical for effective precision scaling in LLM pre-training, and the proposed round-to-infinity method enhances numeric stability and convergence in MX formats.

Abstract: Precision scaling - using fewer bits to represent model parameters and
related tensors during pre-training - has emerged as a compelling technique for
improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX)
formats in NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs represent a major leap in enabling
this precision scaling aspect. These formats combine narrow floating-point data
types with per-block scaling factors, offering a fine-grained approach to
quantizing tensors.
  Although MX-formats offer the promise of improved numeric stability compared
to other reduced-precision representations, in practice they must be used
carefully in order to successfully converge an LLM on a multi-trillion token
dataset. In this paper, we show that the rounding mode suggested in OCP
specification can lead to divergence when pre-training an LLM. We show an
improved rounding mode, which uses round-to-infinity to compute scaling
factors, enables successful pre-training in MXFP8 for an 8B model on 15T
tokens.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models have transformed natural language processing, yet
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains computationally intensive. This paper
formally proves that capabilities acquired through SFT can be approximated by a
base transformer model using inference-time techniques, specifically in-context
learning (ICL), without altering model parameters, under idealized assumptions
including unbounded computational resources and access to the fine-tuning
dataset. We extend these results to practical scenarios with finite context
lengths and partial dataset access. For text generation tasks with fixed output
length $l$, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{m V}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{m}{\delta} \right)$ or, with bounded context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{l
\log V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ suffice to approximate
fine-tuned behavior across $m$ contexts within error $\varepsilon$, where $V$
is the vocabulary size and $\delta$ is the failure probability. For linear
classification, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{d}{\varepsilon}
\right)$ or, with fixed context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ are sufficient, where $d$ is the input dimension.
Grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, these results provide a
theoretical foundation for resource-efficient deployment of large language
models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging
theory to real-world applications.

TL;DR: FairDICE is the first offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objectives, showing strong fairness-aware performance in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of linear scalarization in MORL for capturing fairness-oriented goals, and to develop a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear welfare criteria in the offline setting.

Method: The method involves leveraging distribution correction estimation to jointly account for welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and sample-efficient learning without explicit preference weights or exhaustive weight search.

Result: FairDICE demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance across multiple offline benchmarks compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that FairDICE provides a novel offline MORL framework for directly optimizing nonlinear welfare objectives, offering stability and sample efficiency without the need for explicit preference weights or extensive weight searches.

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in
the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly
used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for
certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such
as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and
non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed
for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear
welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a
fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first
offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective.
FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for
welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and
sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or
exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE
demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of
real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and
training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and
data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional
approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training
efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a
subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and
introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework
that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective
annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source
models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve
datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K,
Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without
performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without
tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with
semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement
using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective
decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation
models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains
uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art
pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and
TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for
EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with
a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the
TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL
model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its
consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM
statistically outperforming it.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It is common in supervised machine learning to combine the feature extraction
capabilities of neural networks with the predictive power of traditional
algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or support vector machines. This
procedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a
domain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional
predictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner,
traditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model
itself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings
specifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense
layer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into
SFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many
traditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due
to their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements.
As a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors
Attention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network
attention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a
differentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple
unstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer
prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation
when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional
remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur
high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work,
we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training
dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model
dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies
during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns
class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,
effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity
Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature
representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability
to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing
methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and
efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in
resource-constrained settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/UniVarFL

Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder
autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and
planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving
dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance
improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a
strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics.
Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has
important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model
development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number
of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training
compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows,
optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset
size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that
sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive
with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models
becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results
demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties
of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their
performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly
study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to
improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address
the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data
from electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in
scalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology.
However, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the
reliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for
research, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance
frameworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique
error modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical
data extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance
benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks
for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing
LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This
multidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need
of improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of
dataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework
supports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups.
By providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD,
this framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of
AI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing equivariant neural networks are computationally heavy and have high parameter counts, limiting their efficiency and flexibility.

Method: A zero-parameter approach that adds an approximate equivariance term to the loss function for a finite group in the latent space.

Result: The method achieves similar or better performance than existing equivariant methods with a fraction of the parameters, and the network learns the regular representation in the latent space.

Conclusion: Imposing approximate equivariance via a loss term is effective and efficient, offering a simpler alternative to traditional equivariant methods.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks incorporate symmetries through group actions,
embedding them as an inductive bias to improve performance on a wide variety of
tasks. However, existing equivariant methods can be computationally intensive,
with high parameter counts, and are often tied to a specific architecture. We
propose a simple zero-parameter approach that imposes approximate equivariance
for a finite group in the latent representation, as an additional term in the
loss function. We conduct experiments which allow the network to learn a group
representation on the latent space, and show in every case it prefers to learn
the regular representation. Fixing this action on the latent space, this yields
a simple method to impose approximate equivariance as an additional loss
penalty. We benchmark our approach on three datasets and compare it against
several existing equivariant methods, showing that in many cases it achieves
similar or better performance for a fraction of the parameters.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Traditional deep neural networks suffer from several limitations, including
catastrophic forgetting. When models are adapted to new datasets, they tend to
quickly forget previously learned knowledge. Another significant issue is the
lack of robustness to even small perturbations in the input data. In practice,
we can often easily perform adversarial attacks and change the network's
predictions, adding minimal noise to the input. Dedicated architectures and
training procedures can solve each of the above problems separately.
Unfortunately, currently, no model can simultaneously address both catastrophic
forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We introduce SHIELD
(Secure Hypernetworks for Incremental Expansion and Learning Defense), a novel
approach that integrates a hypernetwork-based continual learning approach with
interval arithmetic. SHIELD use the hypernetwork to transfer trainable task
embedding vectors into the weights of a target model dedicated to specific
data. This paradigm allows for the dynamic generation of separate networks for
each subtask, while the hypernetwork aggregates and analyzes information across
all tasks. The target model takes in the input a data sample with a defined
interval range, and by creating a hypercube, produces a prediction for the
given range. Therefore, such target models provide strict guarantees against
all possible attacks for data samples within the interval range. Our approach
enhances security without sacrificing network adaptability, addressing the
overlooked challenge of safety in continual learning.

Abstract: Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a
tradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in
sensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose
High-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a
method that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing
helpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human
preferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by
training a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a
two-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the
reward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost
constraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to
verify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the
actual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including
proof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater
than a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF
to align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and
LLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF
produces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and
helpfulness compared to previous methods.

Motivation: To address the scalability and symbolic consistency issues in existing symbolic regression methods that rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling.

Method: LIES uses a fixed neural network architecture with primitive activations (logarithm, identity, exponential, sine) and employs training with oversampling strategy and tailored loss function to promote sparsity and prevent gradient instability, followed by pruning strategies to simplify expressions.

Result: LIES consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae that outperform all baselines on SR benchmarks.

Conclusion: The LIES framework is effective for symbolic regression, with each design component contributing to its success as shown by ablation studies.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical
expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and
analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often
rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with
scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity,
Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable
primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We
develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training
with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to
promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it
applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned
expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that
the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae
outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design
component through ablation studies.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities,
yet they often suffer from inefficiencies due to unnecessarily verbose or
redundant outputs. While many works have explored reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance reasoning abilities, most primarily focus on improving accuracy,
with limited attention to reasoning efficiency. Some existing approaches
introduce direct length-based rewards to encourage brevity, but this often
leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL
framework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient
reasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length
reward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens,
and a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for
hard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and
efficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based
reward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly
for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning
frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a
positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent
state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However,
the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most
positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are
inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering
works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the
structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving
topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are
equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their
capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on
large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable
Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and
propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for
L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the
graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that
MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance
on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to
show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less
empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link

Result: The review summarizes various graph prompting techniques, their applications, and identifies open challenges in the field.

Conclusion: Graph prompting offers a viable method for adapting pre-trained models, but further research is needed to address current limitations and explore future directions.

Abstract: Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive
representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world
scenarios. As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models,
the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on
unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges
as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the
pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a
systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we
introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the
foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in
graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph
prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph
prompting from different domains. Finally, we discuss several open challenges
in existing studies with promising future directions in this field.

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and
lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM
coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash
equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic
beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via
Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that
marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each
LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward,
conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly
inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly
tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically,
ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six
benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments
demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models,
confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful
multi-LLM ensembles. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive
reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a
solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with
external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little
systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel
benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.
AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and
guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and
measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning
challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary
LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently
fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap
highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning
abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,
such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest
gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.
Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology
for active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time
feedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training. The benchmark is

Abstract: Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to
boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various
methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic
solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches
often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training
of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we
model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and
introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine
answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically,
DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution.
Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show
improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on
benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases
first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An
ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and
out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for
one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve
its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of
reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and
cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From
these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration
challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs)
focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are
prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to
simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their
students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation
to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In
practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on
competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and
cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of
orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness
when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution
tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning
framework.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is
still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed
examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess
whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry
of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that
generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes
with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these
approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically
task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that
linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and,
when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint
supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of
probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation
vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when
examined across tasks.

Conclusion: The high-resolution dataset improves understanding of displacement drivers.

Abstract: We present a semi-supervised approach that disaggregates refugee statistics

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cyclone rapid intensification is the rapid increase in cyclone wind
intensity, exceeding a threshold of 30 knots, within 24 hours. Rapid
intensification is considered an extreme event during a cyclone, and its
occurrence is relatively rare, contributing to a class imbalance in the
dataset. A diverse array of factors influences the likelihood of a cyclone
undergoing rapid intensification, further complicating the task for
conventional machine learning models. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning,
ensemble learning and data augmentation frameworks to detect cyclone rapid
intensification based on wind intensity and spatial coordinates. We note that
conventional data augmentation methods cannot be utilised for generating
spatiotemporal patterns replicating cyclones that undergo rapid
intensification. Therefore, our framework employs deep learning models to
generate spatial coordinates and wind intensity that replicate cyclones to
address the class imbalance problem of rapid intensification. We also use a
deep learning model for the classification module within the data augmentation
framework to differentiate between rapid and non-rapid intensification events
during a cyclone. Our results show that data augmentation improves the results
for rapid intensification detection in cyclones, and spatial coordinates play a
critical role as input features to the given models. This paves the way for
research in synthetic data generation for spatiotemporal data with extreme
events.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with distributional shifts,
leading to the $Q$-value overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions.
Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they
often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains
the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor
$Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing
$Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its
Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we
propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by
smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show
that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within
the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG),
empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate
$Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the straggler effect in existing split federated learning approaches caused by heterogeneous edge device capabilities.

Method: The method involves deriving a tight convergence bound for SFL and using it to create HASFL, which adaptively adjusts batch sizes and model splitting.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show HASFL is effective and outperforms existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: HASFL effectively balances communication-computing latency and training convergence in heterogeneous edge networks.

Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to
democratize machine learning (ML) on edge devices by enabling layer-wise model
partitioning. However, existing SFL approaches suffer significantly from the
straggler effect due to the heterogeneous capabilities of edge devices. To
address the fundamental challenge, we propose adaptively controlling batch
sizes (BSs) and model splitting (MS) for edge devices to overcome resource
heterogeneity. We first derive a tight convergence bound of SFL that quantifies
the impact of varied BSs and MS on learning performance. Based on the
convergence bound, we propose HASFL, a heterogeneity-aware SFL framework
capable of adaptively controlling BS and MS to balance communication-computing
latency and training convergence in heterogeneous edge networks. Extensive
experiments with various datasets validate the effectiveness of HASFL and
demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve performance and data efficiency in control tasks by accounting for temporal dynamics, as conventional models use fixed time-steps which may not be optimal.

Method: The method involves training a model-based approach with conditional time-step size Δt and varying Δt values to learn high- and low-frequency task dynamics.

Result: Empirical evaluations show TAWM consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates in control tasks with the same training samples and iterations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that TAWM's time-aware formulation improves performance and data efficiency by optimizing sampling rates based on system dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based
approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the
time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t
values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high-
and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in
the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a
system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both
performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM
consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates
in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and
iterations. Our code can be found online at:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, such as
mathematical problem solving. A prerequisite for the scalability of RLVR is a
high-quality problem set with precise and verifiable answers. However, the
scarcity of well-crafted human-labeled math problems and limited-verification
answers in existing distillation-oriented synthetic datasets limit their
effectiveness in RL. Additionally, most problem synthesis strategies
indiscriminately expand the problem set without considering the model's
capabilities, leading to low efficiency in generating useful questions. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce a Self-aware Weakness-driven problem
Synthesis framework (SwS) that systematically identifies model deficiencies and
leverages them for problem augmentation. Specifically, we define weaknesses as
questions that the model consistently fails to learn through its iterative
sampling during RL training. We then extract the core concepts from these
failure cases and synthesize new problems to strengthen the model's weak areas
in subsequent augmented training, enabling it to focus on and gradually
overcome its weaknesses. Without relying on external knowledge distillation,
our framework enables robust generalization byempowering the model to
self-identify and address its weaknesses in RL, yielding average performance
gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight mainstream reasoning
benchmarks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the
goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and
target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL
methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the
target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by
the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the
learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.
We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that
addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via
learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target
domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during
offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn
dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched
dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these
datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY
learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states
and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize
training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the
policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that
regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather
than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned
from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented
source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate
MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in
challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by
utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this
paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard
problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget
they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning
models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is
by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to
effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as
generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses
before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify
three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the
base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with
generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging
"negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL,
resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3)
coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a
specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our
recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25
scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not
only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In sequential decision-making problems, Return-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (RCSL) has gained increasing recognition for its simplicity and
stability in modern decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional offline
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a
supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This
approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference
(TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the
stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the
quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this
limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced
RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we
call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our
policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the
current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently
outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our
claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of
benchmarks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple
clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy,
at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,
several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage
attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to
reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,
contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the
effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as
small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that
clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL
environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance
failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To
alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,
which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient
regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world
FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a
thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this
protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby
underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need
for more effective defense methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in post-hoc explainability techniques for
neural networks, many current methods rely on heuristics and do not provide
formally provable guarantees over the explanations provided. Recent work has
shown that it is possible to obtain explanations with formal guarantees by
identifying subsets of input features that are sufficient to determine that
predictions remain unchanged using neural network verification techniques.
Despite the appeal of these explanations, their computation faces significant
scalability challenges. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel
abstraction-refinement technique for efficiently computing provably sufficient
explanations of neural network predictions. Our method abstracts the original
large neural network by constructing a substantially reduced network, where a
sufficient explanation of the reduced network is also provably sufficient for
the original network, hence significantly speeding up the verification process.
If the explanation is in sufficient on the reduced network, we iteratively
refine the network size by gradually increasing it until convergence. Our
experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the efficiency of obtaining
provably sufficient explanations for neural network predictions while
additionally providing a fine-grained interpretation of the network's
predictions across different abstraction levels.

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry,

propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series

Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we
theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for
time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens
and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification
benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We
explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate
layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series
classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM
representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further
performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet

Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow
matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and
building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the
underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching
(PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical
constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching
objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves
the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly
minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without
requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we
analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of
physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to
reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative
PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate
physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing
algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled
and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and
accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet
effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and
active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based
Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative
algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents
relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are
sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing
existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the
JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes
standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny
Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate
that
  JoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence,
highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of
position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual
variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong
performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive
architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled
approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: This paper proposes ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based model that handles multivariate time series with asynchronous sampling and missing values, showing better performance in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series data are multivariate with complex channel dependencies, but existing models assume uniform sampling and full observability, which are not practical.

Method: Introduce ChannelTokenFormer, a flexible Transformer model to capture cross-channel interactions, handle asynchronous sampling, and manage missing values.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show ChannelTokenFormer is more robust and accurate under real-world conditions with asynchronous and missing data.

Conclusion: ChannelTokenFormer addresses the challenges of real-world time series forecasting by explicitly modeling channel dependencies and handling practical data issues.

Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting
complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its
own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and
operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges
related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of
which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical
settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified
assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully
observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based
forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture
cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and
effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world
industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of
ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The continuous improvements on image compression with variational
autoencoders have lead to learned codecs competitive with conventional
approaches in terms of rate-distortion efficiency. Nonetheless, taking the
quantization into account during the training process remains a problem, since
it produces zero derivatives almost everywhere and needs to be replaced with a
differentiable approximation which allows end-to-end optimization. Though there
are different methods for approximating the quantization, none of them model
the quantization noise correctly and thus, result in suboptimal networks.
Hence, we propose an additional finetuning training step: After conventional
end-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents
obtained at the inference stage. For entropy-constraint quantizers like
Trellis-Coded Quantization, the impact of the quantizer is particularly
difficult to approximate by rounding or adding noise as the quantized latents
are interdependently chosen through a trellis search based on both the entropy
model and a distortion measure. We show that retraining on correctly quantized
data consistently yields additional coding gain for both uniform scalar and
especially for entropy-constraint quantization, without increasing inference
complexity. For the Kodak test set, we obtain average savings between 1% and
2%, and for the TecNick test set up to 2.2% in terms of Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta
bitrate.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to
large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their
reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM
reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide
structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle
related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template
search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our
framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including
math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves
the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring
additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution
for on-device or resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: HDI PLM data in smart grids challenges PLF models, necessitating an efficient data completion solution.

Method: VAE-LF uses an Encoder-Decoder structure with VAE to learn low-dimensional latent representations of HDI PLM data by splitting into vectors and feeding sequentially.

Result: VAE-LF outperforms benchmarks in 5% and 10% sparsity tests with lower RMSE and MAE, particularly excelling in low sparsity scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an effective data-completion approach for electric load management in smart grids.

Abstract: With the development of smart grids, High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI)
Power Load Monitoring (PLM) data challenges the performance of Power Load
Forecasting (PLF) models. In this paper, we propose a potential
characterization model VAE-LF based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for
efficiently representing and complementing PLM missing data. VAE-LF learns a
low-dimensional latent representation of the data using an Encoder-Decoder
structure by splitting the HDI PLM data into vectors and feeding them
sequentially into the VAE-LF model, and generates the complementary data.
Experiments on the UK-DALE dataset show that VAE-LF outperforms other benchmark
models in both 5% and 10% sparsity test cases, with significantly lower RMSE

provides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in
smart grids.

Abstract: While Generative AI stands to be one of the fastest adopted technologies
ever, studies have made evident that the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs)
puts significant burden on energy grids and our environment. It may prove a
hindrance to the Sustainability goals of any organization. A crucial step in
any Sustainability strategy is monitoring or estimating the energy consumption
of various components. While there exist multiple tools for monitoring energy
consumption, there is a dearth of tools/frameworks for estimating the
consumption or carbon emissions. Current drawbacks of both monitoring and
estimation tools include high input data points, intrusive nature, high error
margin, etc. We posit that leveraging emerging LLM benchmarks and related data
points can help overcome aforementioned challenges while balancing accuracy of
the emission estimations. To that extent, we discuss the challenges of current
approaches and present our evolving framework, R-ICE, which estimates prompt
level inference carbon emissions by leveraging existing state-of-the-art(SOTA)
benchmark. This direction provides a more practical and non-intrusive way to
enable emerging use-cases like dynamic LLM routing, carbon accounting, etc. Our
promising validation results suggest that benchmark-based modelling holds great
potential for inference emission estimation and warrants further exploration
from the scientific community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance policy diversity and exploration in RL by addressing limitations of existing exploration strategies.

Method: Adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards to encourage diverse policies, compatible with action-perturbation methods like epsilon-greedy and entropy regularization.

Result: RRP improves PPO and SAC performance, increases sample efficiency, and helps avoid local optima in different reward scenarios.

Conclusion: RRP is a general, lightweight method that effectively combines with existing RL strategies and shows promise in improving exploration across tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Random Reward Perturbation (RRP), a novel exploration strategy
for reinforcement learning (RL). Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that
adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards effectively enhances policy
diversity during training, thereby expanding the range of exploration. RRP is
fully compatible with the action-perturbation-based exploration strategies,
such as $\epsilon$-greedy, stochastic policies, and entropy regularization,
providing additive improvements to exploration effects. It is general,
lightweight, and can be integrated into existing RL algorithms with minimal
implementation effort and negligible computational overhead. RRP establishes a
theoretical connection between reward shaping and noise-driven exploration,
highlighting their complementary potential. Experiments show that RRP
significantly boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft
Actor-Critic, achieving higher sample efficiency and escaping local optima
across various tasks, under both sparse and dense reward scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning
research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can
be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute
resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific
tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing
because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL,
including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a
fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions
have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across
time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for
modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic
model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant
future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are
often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include
in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention
increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with
generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method
intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative
methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$
image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8
\times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

TL;DR: The paper addresses environmental state perturbations in DRL, proposing a defense framework called BAT that uses supervised learning and adversarial training to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the robustness of DRL agents against environmental state perturbations, which are common in embodied scenarios but underexplored in existing research.

Method: The method involves a non-targeted attack approach called the calibration adversary and a defense framework named Boosted Adversarial Training (BAT) that combines supervised learning and adversarial reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments show that mainstream DRL agents are vulnerable to environmental state perturbations, and the proposed BAT framework effectively improves their robustness across different scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that existing robust RL algorithms may not handle environmental perturbations well, but BAT provides a significant improvement in agent robustness against such attacks.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have
been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider
environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To
improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental
state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a
calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted
Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised
learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains
the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results
substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state
perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results
demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may
not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of
agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.

Abstract: The ability to train high-performing reward models with few-shot data is
critical for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). We propose a data augmentation and expansion
framework that enables generative reward models trained on small datasets to
achieve comparable performance to those trained on large-scale datasets.
Traditional methods to train a generative reward model, such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), are constrained by inefficiencies in sample
pairing and limited data diversity. This work introduces preference refinement,
which employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sampling to uncover diverse and
high-quality preference relationships. It also incorporates a perplexity-based
scoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level
Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture
finer-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and
model performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to
achieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets. This study
underscores the potential of data-efficient strategies in advancing reward
model optimization, offering a robust solution for low-resource RLHF
applications.

Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular

Abstract: The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent
symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work
focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as
their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this
paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key
neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a
controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to
generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured
and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a
balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and
enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training
distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that
generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation,
remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation
compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings
highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to
learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for
stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of non-autoregressive models in generating variable-length sequences by introducing a flexible, position-relative approach using edit operations.

Method: The method involves defining a discrete flow over sequences through insertions, deletions, and substitutions within a Continuous-time Markov Chain, with an expanded state space and auxiliary variables for efficient training.

Result: Empirical results show Edit Flows outperforms autoregressive and mask models in image captioning and significantly outperforms mask models in text and code generation.

Conclusion: Edit Flows provides a flexible, position-relative sequence generation method that aligns with sequence data structure, enabling efficient and effective non_autoregressive modeling.

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length
sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid,
token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that
overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through
edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these
operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit
Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely
with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded
state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and
tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both
autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly
outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks:
the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to
more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order
(ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward
passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to
converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally
improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater
memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast
Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward
passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that
adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also
accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector
perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on
diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3,
across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms
MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For
RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy
and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving
convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis
proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its
convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling
even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed,
full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on
memory-efficient pre-training.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for

on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these
constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that
conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network
architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer
forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural
Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing
inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically
decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation
methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring
backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through
iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and
coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or
specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and
adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent
baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance
improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven
framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of
LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan
to open-source the entire framework.

Abstract: This work presents a novel course titled The World of AI designed for
first-year undergraduate engineering students with little to no prior exposure
to AI. The central problem addressed by this course is that engineering
students often lack foundational knowledge of AI and its broader societal
implications at the outset of their academic journeys. We believe the way to
address this gap is to design and deliver an interdisciplinary course that can
a) be accessed by first-year undergraduate engineering students across any
domain, b) enable them to understand the basic workings of AI systems sans
mathematics, and c) make them appreciate AI's far-reaching implications on our
lives. The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from
both engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role
as both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental
challenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around
privacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job
displacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this
course lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical
approach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results
revealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse
metrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b)
efficient corrective solutions for AI fairness. Furthermore, it also indicated
the evolution in students' perception of AI's transformative impact on our

Abstract: This research investigates the use of machine learning methods to forecast

all implementations. Under 10-fold cross validation, MLPC obtained 79.58%
average accuracy for test set while for train set, it was 99.65%. MLP's better
performance over other machine learning models strongly suggest the potential
use of neural networks as data-efficient models. Feature selection approach
played a crucial role in improving the performance and multiple evaluation

Abstract: This research-to-practice work-in-progress (WIP) paper presents an AI-enabled
smart tutor designed to provide homework assessment and feedback for students
in an undergraduate circuit analysis course. We detail the tutor's design
philosophy and core components, including open-ended question answering and
homework feedback generation. The prompts are carefully crafted to optimize
responses across different problems. The smart tutor was deployed on the
Microsoft Azure platform and is currently in use in an undergraduate circuit
analysis course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in a
large, public, research-intensive institution in the Southeastern United
States. Beyond offering personalized instruction and feedback, the tutor
collects student interaction data, which is summarized and shared with the
course instructor. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected student
feedback, with 90.9% of responses indicating satisfaction with the tutor.
Additionally, we analyze a subset of collected data on preliminary circuit
analysis topics to assess tutor usage frequency for each problem and identify
frequently asked questions. These insights help instructors gain real-time
awareness of student difficulties, enabling more targeted classroom
instruction. In future work, we will release a full analysis once the complete
dataset is available after the Spring 2025 semester. We also explore the
potential applications of this smart tutor across a broader range of
engineering disciplines by developing improved prompts, diagram-recognition
methods, and database management strategies, which remain ongoing areas of
research.

*Kimihiro Noguchi*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper transforms the Erdos-Kac theorem to improve interval estimates for the prime omega function, using delta method, square-root, and three-quarters power transformations, and introduces a score interval estimate that performs well for small integers after training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide more flexible interval estimates for the prime omega function, which counts distinct prime divisors, to make them reliable for small positive integers.

Method: The method involves transforming the Erdos-Kac theorem via the delta method, examining square-root and three-quarters power transformations for variance stabilization and optimal width, and deriving a score interval estimate by adjusting the denominator. Fuzzy coverage probabilities are used to evaluate performance.

Result: The score interval estimate shows good performance for small integers after training the mean and standard deviation. The Poisson interval estimate is also relatively reliable, with or without training. Additional theoretical results on Erdos-Pomerance theorem are provided.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that transformed interval estimates, particularly the score interval, are effective for small positive integers when properly trained, and contributes theoretical results related to the Erdos-Pomerance theorem.

Abstract: Transforming the Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem provides more flexibility in how the
theorem can be utilized as an interval estimate for the prime omega function,
which counts the number of distinct prime divisors. Here, we consider a direct
transformation by the delta method. Then, we demonstrate that the square-root
and three-quarters power asymptotically achieve variance stabilization and an
optimal width, respectively. Furthermore, by adjusting the denominator of the
theorem, we derive the score interval estimate. To make these interval
estimates reliable for small positive integers, we examine performances of
various interval estimates for the prime omega function using fuzzy coverage
probabilities. The results indicate that the score interval estimate performs
well even for small positive integers after training the mean and standard
deviation using the prime omega function. Moreover, the Poisson interval
estimate is relatively reliable with or without training. Additional
theoretical results on the Erd\H{o}s-Pomerance theorem are also provided.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to a variety of
coding tasks, including code generation, completion, and repair. However, more
complex symbolic reasoning tasks remain largely unexplored by LLMs. This paper
investigates the capacity of LLMs to reason about worst-case executions in
programs through symbolic constraints analysis, aiming to connect LLMs and
symbolic reasoning approaches. Specifically, we define and address the problem
of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the
comprehension of LLMs. We evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this
novel task and further improve their capabilities through symbolic
reasoning-guided fine-tuning, grounded in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)
constraint solving and supported by a specially designed dataset of symbolic
constraints. Experimental results show that our solver-aligned model,
WARP-1.0-3B, consistently surpasses size-matched and even much larger
baselines, demonstrating that a 3B LLM can recover the very constraints that
pin down an algorithm's worst-case behaviour through reinforcement learning
methods. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of engaging in deeper
symbolic reasoning, supporting a closer integration between neural
network-based learning and formal methods for rigorous program analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' strengths in code generation, their use in complex software tasks is limited by low precision and poor interpretability. Repeton aims to address these issues for better autonomous debugging.

Method: Repeton uses a structured patch-and-test pipeline: iteratively diagnosing issues, proposing changes, and validating patches with automated tests, guided by heuristics and tools without embedding retrieval.

Result: Evaluated on SWE-bench Lite, Repeton performs well compared to RAG-based methods in patch validity and interpretability, offering a scalable and transparent approach to debugging.

Conclusion: Repeton's modular, verifiable stages make it a practical solution for improving precision and interpretability in autonomous software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code
generation and comprehension, yet their application to complex software
engineering tasks often suffers from low precision and limited
interpretability. We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that
leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git
repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a
structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes
code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise
process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding
reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite
benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in
both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering
tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward
scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), software engineering agents
(SWE agents) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating a range of
software tasks -- from code generation and repair to test case synthesis. These
agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to
environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated
strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive
their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows
hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work,
we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of
execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first
taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2)
using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent
success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation
-- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on
successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful
test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone
analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a
qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch
content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and
open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned
with human development practices.

Motivation: Software sustainability is crucial for optimizing resources and reducing environmental impact. However, there's a lack of studies on how sustainable AI-generated code is, despite its growing use.

Method: The study examines AI-generated code from three tools (ChatGPT, BARD, Copilot) to assess their adherence to sustainable coding practices across various rules and scenarios.

Result: The results show that the AI tools default to non-green code generation, indicating a need for further research and strategies to improve sustainability.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current AI code generation tools are not environmentally friendly by default, highlighting the importance of developing effective remediation strategies to enhance software sustainability.

Abstract: Software sustainability is emerging as a primary concern, aiming to optimize
resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and promote a greener,
more resilient digital ecosystem. The sustainability or "greenness" of software
is typically determined by the adoption of sustainable coding practices. With a
maturing ecosystem around generative AI, many software developers now rely on
these tools to generate code using natural language prompts. Despite their
potential advantages, there is a significant lack of studies on the
sustainability aspects of AI-generated code. Specifically, how environmentally
friendly is the AI-generated code based upon its adoption of sustainable coding
practices? In this paper, we present the results of an early investigation into
the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code across three popular generative
AI tools - ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot. The results highlight the default
non-green behavior of tools for generating code, across multiple rules and
scenarios. It underscores the need for further in-depth investigations and
effective remediation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In hypothesis testing problems the property of strict unbiasedness describes
whether a test is able to discriminate, in the sense of a difference in power,
between any distribution in the null hypothesis space and any distribution in
the alternative hypothesis space. In this work we examine conditions under
which unbiased tests exist for discrete statistical models. It is shown that
the existence of an unbiased test can be reduced to an algebraic criterion; an
unbiased test exists if and only if there exists a polynomial that separates
the null and alternative hypothesis sets. This places a strong, semialgebraic
restriction on the classes of null hypotheses that have unbiased tests. The
minimum degree of a separating polynomial coincides with the minimum sample
size that is needed for an unbiased test to exist, termed the unbiasedness
threshold. It is demonstrated that Gr\"obner basis techniques can be used to
provide upper bounds for, and in many cases exactly find, the unbiasedness
threshold. Existence questions for uniformly most powerful unbiased tests are
also addressed, where it is shown that whether such a test exists can depend
subtly on the specified level of the test and the sample size. Numerous
examples, concerning tests in contingency tables, linear, log-linear, and
mixture models are provided. All of the machinery developed in this work is
constructive in the sense that when a test with a certain property is shown to
exist it is possible to explicitly construct this test.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Model averaging is an important alternative to model selection with
attractive prediction accuracy. However, its application to high-dimensional
data remains under-explored. We propose a high-dimensional model averaging
method via cross-validation under a general framework and systematically
establish its theoretical properties. Each candidate model is fitted using a
flexible loss function paired with a general regularizer, and the optimal
weights are determined by minimizing a cross-validation criterion. When all
candidate models are misspecified, we establish a non-asymptotic upper bound
and a minimax lower bound for our weight estimator. The asymptotic optimality
is also derived, showing that the proposed weight estimator achieves the lowest
possible prediction risk asymptotically. When the correct models are included
in the candidate model set, the proposed method asymptotically assigns all
weights to the correct models, and the model averaging estimator achieves a
nearly-oracle convergence rate. Further, we introduce a post-averaging debiased
estimator and establish Gaussian and bootstrap approximation to construct
simultaneous confidence intervals. A fast greedy model averaging (FGMA)
algorithm is proposed to solve the simplex-constrained optimization problem,
which has a descent property empirically and a faster convergence rate,
compared to the original greedy model averaging algorithm. Empirical results
demonstrate the strong competitiveness of the proposed method in prediction and
inference, compared to other existing model averaging and selection methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another
alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is,
the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps
surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models,
including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the
only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be
monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable
to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding
of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we
propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion
Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that
guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from
being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models
improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In high-dimensional time series analysis, Gaussian approximation (GA) schemes
under various distance measures or on various collections of subsets of the
Euclidean space play a fundamental role in a wide range of statistical
inference problems. To date, most GA results for high-dimensional time series
are established on hyper-rectangles and their equivalence. In this paper, by
considering the 2-Wasserstein distance and the collection of all convex sets,
we establish a general GA theory for a broad class of high-dimensional
non-stationary (HDNS) time series, extending the scope of problems that can be
addressed in HDNS time series analysis. For HDNS time series of sufficiently
weak dependence and light tail, the GA rates established in this paper are
either nearly optimal with respect to the dimensionality and time series
length, or they are nearly identical to the corresponding best-known GA rates
established for independent data. A multiplier bootstrap procedure is utilized
and theoretically justified to implement our GA theory. We demonstrate by two
previously undiscussed time series applications the use of the GA theory and
the bootstrap procedure as unified tools for a wide range of statistical
inference problems in HDNS time series analysis.

TL;DR: This paper studies Dirichlet kernel density estimators for compositional data on simplices, focusing on time-dependent observations with strong mixing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding for Dirichlet kernel density estimators in time-dependent compositional data scenarios, especially under strong mixing conditions.

Method: The paper analyzes the theoretical properties of Dirichlet kernel density estimators, extending previous results from iid settings to strongly mixing processes. It applies the estimator to real-world data (Renault vehicle market shares) using leave-one-out least squares cross-validation for bandwidth selection.

Result: The study demonstrates that Dirichlet kernel density estimators are reliable and effective for time-dependent compositional data under strong mixing conditions, with established asymptotic normality and mean squared error properties.

Conclusion: Dirichlet kernel techniques are shown to be robust and applicable to temporally dependent compositional data, highlighting their potential for broader use in similar contexts.

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical properties of Dirichlet kernel
density estimators for compositional data supported on simplices, for the first
time addressing scenarios involving time-dependent observations characterized
by strong mixing conditions. We establish rigorous results for the asymptotic
normality and mean squared error of these estimators, extending previous
findings from the independent and identically distributed (iid) context to the
more general setting of strongly mixing processes. To demonstrate its practical
utility, the estimator is applied to monthly market-share compositions of
several Renault vehicle classes over a twelve-year period, with bandwidth
selection performed via leave-one-out least squares cross-validation. Our
findings underscore the reliability and strength of Dirichlet kernel techniques
when applied to temporally dependent compositional data.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bernstein estimator for lower-tail Spearman's rho, showing it's consistent and normally distributed with some mild conditions. It uses smoothing on the empirical copula to reduce MSE in tail areas, especially with weak to moderate dependence and small samples, and provides R code for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the estimation of Spearman's rho in the lower tail of a copula by reducing mean squared error through smoothing, which addresses the limitations of the classical estimator in tail regions.

Method: The method involves developing a Bernstein estimator for lower-tail Spearman's rho and applying smoothing to the empirical copula. The paper establishes strong consistency and asymptotic normality under mild regularity conditions.

Result: The Monte Carlo simulation with the Farlie--Gumbel--Morgenstern copula shows that the Bernstein estimator achieves up to ~70% lower MSE at deep-tail thresholds compared to the classical estimator, particularly under weak to moderate dependence and small sample sizes.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the Bernstein estimator offers significant improvements in MSE for lower-tail Spearman's rho estimation, making it a valuable tool for applications where accurate tail dependence analysis is crucial, and the provided R code enhances reproducibility.

Abstract: This note develops a Bernstein estimator for lower-tail Spearman's rho and
establishes its strong consistency and asymptotic normality under mild
regularity conditions. Smoothing the empirical copula yields a strictly smaller
mean squared error (MSE) in tail regions by lowering sampling variance relative
to the classical Spearman's rho estimator. A Monte Carlo simulation experiment
with the Farlie--Gumbel--Morgenstern copula demonstrates variance reductions
that translate into lower MSE estimates (up to $\sim 70\%$ lower) at deep-tail
thresholds under weak to moderate dependence and small sample sizes. To
facilitate reproducibility of the findings, the R code that generated all
simulation results is readily accessible online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why comparison-based AI preference learning methods sometimes behave counterintuitively, especially when they reduce the probability of preferred responses.

Method: The method involves theoretical analysis under mild assumptions to investigate the root causes of non-monotonicity in preference learning frameworks like DPO, GPO, and GGBT.

Result: The results show that these methods maintain local pairwise monotonicity but can have monotonicity violations under certain conditions, with identified sufficient conditions for such violations.

Conclusion: The conclusions highlight the limitations of current methods and provide a framework to evaluate and improve preference learning algorithms for better reliability.

Abstract: Comparison-based preference learning has become central to the alignment of
AI models with human preferences. However, these methods may behave
counterintuitively. After empirically observing that, when accounting for a
preference for response $y$ over $z$, the model may actually decrease the
probability (and reward) of generating $y$ (an observation also made by
others), this paper investigates the root causes of (non) monotonicity, for a
general comparison-based preference learning framework that subsumes Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Generalized Preference Optimization (GPO) and
Generalized Bradley-Terry (GBT). Under mild assumptions, we prove that such
methods still satisfy what we call local pairwise monotonicity. We also provide
a bouquet of formalizations of monotonicity, and identify sufficient conditions
for their guarantee, thereby providing a toolbox to evaluate how prone learning
models are to monotonicity violations. These results clarify the limitations of
current methods and provide guidance for developing more trustworthy preference
learning algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to handle uncertainty propagation in models with a large number of random inputs, which is challenging due to the difficulties in creating uniform partitions in high dimensions.

Method: The method involves stratified sampling with respect to the uniform distribution over the unit interval, followed by deriving strata in the original space using nonlinear dimensionality reduction.

Result: The result demonstrates that the approach is effective in high dimensions and can further reduce the variance of multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that the proposed method overcomes the challenges of high-dimensional stratification and effectively reduces variance in multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators.

Abstract: We consider the problem of propagating the uncertainty from a possibly large
number of random inputs through a computationally expensive model. Stratified
sampling is a well-known variance reduction strategy, but its application, thus
far, has focused on models with a limited number of inputs due to the
challenges of creating uniform partitions in high dimensions. To overcome these
challenges, we perform stratification with respect to the uniform distribution
defined over the unit interval, and then derive the corresponding strata in the
original space using nonlinear dimensionality reduction. We show that our
approach is effective in high dimensions and can be used to further reduce the
variance of multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute
feature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the
small data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and
provably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from
translations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition
of watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine
transformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this
issue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only
requires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary
affine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the
max-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against
non-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its
separability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance
between the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance
only allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a
mean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the
Wasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive
noise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical
experiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well
as their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.
