We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether\nan LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing\nconsistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing\nbetween prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs\nacross diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater\nshare of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more\nrobust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do\nnot consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their\nadvantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the\nimportance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic\ndiagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's\ninternal understanding of the world.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models.

However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment.

We\nintroduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses\nthese challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal\nModeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks\nprocessed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This\ndual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient\ncomputation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs\nlearnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while\npreserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the\nanti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks\nof RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system\nis adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed\noscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for\nlong-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X\nfaster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08,\nwhile maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of\ncases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise\ntime series modeling.

We introduce\nDiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this\nquestion. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo\nground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to\nsystematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention\nmechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to\nestablishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key\nsimilarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal\nmatching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the\ndenoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in\nzero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance\ncompared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models.\nFurther, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a\nnovel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos\nwithout additional training.

Translating this insight to next-token prediction, we hypothesize\nthat low- and high-ambiguity predictions pose different computational demands,\nmaking ambiguity-agnostic next-token prediction a detrimental inductive bias.\nTo test this, we introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic sequence meta-learning\nbenchmark with rich compositional structure and a tractable Bayesian oracle.

This study explores how different ratios of\nGAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN\nin classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic\nimages which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN.\nThe CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results\nindicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor\nclassification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a\nsmall portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN\nimages, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching\n95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the\nproportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined.\nThis study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets\nespecially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce\nartifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure).

To tackle this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust\nevaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First,\nthe communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a\ntrusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and\nrepresented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures\ntrust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison\nwith data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,\nthe collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as\ntask completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with\nan ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,\nconsisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to\nlearn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.\nFinally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is\ncalculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot.
