Abstract: Global population aging presents increasing challenges to healthcare systems,
with coronary artery disease (CAD) responsible for approximately 17.8 million
deaths annually, making it a leading cause of global mortality. As CAD is
largely preventable, early detection and proactive management are essential. In
this work, we introduce DigitalShadow, an advanced early warning system for
CAD, powered by a fine-tuned facial foundation model. The system is pre-trained
on 21 million facial images and subsequently fine-tuned into LiveCAD, a
specialized CAD risk assessment model trained on 7,004 facial images from 1,751
subjects across four hospitals in China. DigitalShadow functions passively and
contactlessly, extracting facial features from live video streams without
requiring active user engagement. Integrated with a personalized database, it
generates natural language risk reports and individualized health
recommendations. With privacy as a core design principle, DigitalShadow
supports local deployment to ensure secure handling of user data.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image
analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously,
convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense
popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image
recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of
transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using
these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models
that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms
to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their
reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial
perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for
medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called
imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial
watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the
transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense
mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is
not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to
adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless,
adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce a fitness tracking system that enables remote monitoring for
exercises using only a RGB smartphone camera, making fitness tracking more
private, scalable, and cost effective. Although prior work explored automated
exercise supervision, existing models are either too limited in exercise
variety or too complex for real-world deployment. Prior approaches typically
focus on a small set of exercises and fail to generalize across diverse
movements. In contrast, we develop a robust, multitask motion analysis model
capable of performing exercise detection and repetition counting across
hundreds of exercises, a scale far beyond previous methods. We overcome
previous data limitations by assembling a large-scale fitness dataset, Olympia
covering more than 1,900 exercises. To our knowledge, our vision-language model
is the first that can perform multiple tasks on skeletal fitness data. On
Olympia, our model can detect exercises with 76.5% accuracy and count
repetitions with 85.3% off-by-one accuracy, using only RGB video. By presenting
a single vision-language transformer model for both exercise identification and
rep counting, we take a significant step toward democratizing AI-powered
fitness tracking.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Traditional SLAM algorithms are excellent at camera tracking but might
generate lower resolution and incomplete 3D maps. Recently, Gaussian Splatting
(GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map
building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene
optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes
well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM
algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from
an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach
starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian
parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location.
Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS
framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To
correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for
only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of
magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and
showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to
the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

Motivation: Traditional AVS methods require costly pixel-level annotations; this paper aims to eliminate that by using pretrained models.

Method: Integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps without AVS-specific annotations.

Result: State-of-the-art zero-shot AVS performance achieved across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Multimodal model integration is effective for fine-grained audiovisual segmentation.

Abstract: Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) aims to identify visual regions corresponding
to sound sources, playing a vital role in video understanding, surveillance,
and human-computer interaction. Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale
pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To
address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates
task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach
integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps,
enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We
systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models
and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS
performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for
finegrained audiovisual segmentation.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition
because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These
DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not
compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the
robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the
error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding
imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data
augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks.
The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the
perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two
well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and
the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce
the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our
mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%.
Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the
error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of
identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to
human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in
identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced
training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the
effects of data poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of
textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and
detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper
investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing
modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present
computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a)
classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile
features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained
architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with
EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with
81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the
Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the
generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility
of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including
transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot
segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile
recycling pipelines.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Surveillance systems play a critical role in security and reconnaissance, but
their performance is often compromised by low-quality images and videos,
leading to reduced accuracy in face recognition. Additionally, existing
AI-based facial analysis models suffer from biases related to skin tone
variations and partially occluded faces, further limiting their effectiveness
in diverse real-world scenarios. These challenges are the results of data
limitations and imbalances, where available training datasets lack sufficient
diversity, resulting in unfair and unreliable facial recognition performance.
To address these issues, we propose a data-driven platform that enhances
surveillance capabilities by generating synthetic training data tailored to
compensate for dataset biases. Our approach leverages deep learning-based
facial attribute manipulation and reconstruction using autoencoders and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create diverse and high-quality
facial datasets. Additionally, our system integrates an image enhancement
module, improving the clarity of low-resolution or occluded faces in
surveillance footage. We evaluate our approach using the CelebA dataset,
demonstrating that the proposed platform enhances both training data diversity
and model fairness. This work contributes to reducing bias in AI-based facial
analysis and improving surveillance accuracy in challenging environments,
leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics
with much higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras, since pixels
react asynchronously to brightness changes. They are therefore better suited
for tasks involving motion such as motion segmentation. However, training
event-based networks still represents a difficult challenge, as obtaining
ground truth is very expensive, error-prone and limited in frequency. In this
article, we introduce EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based
motion segmentation. Inspired by a layered representation of the scene
dynamics, we show that it is possible to learn affine optical flow and
segmentation masks separately, and use them to deblur the input events. The
deblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss.
We train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion,
achieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical
applications offers promising support for diagnostic reasoning. However,
current medical VLMs often face limitations in generalization, transparency,
and computational efficiency-barriers that hinder deployment in real-world,
resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \textbf{RARL}, that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and
adaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight
base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward
functions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality.
Training is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the
feasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate
the model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and
explanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves
VLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming
supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while
requiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the
generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving
around 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4%
over traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity
prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial
for enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of
reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward
more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) allows a user to locate a target image by
applying a fine-grained textual edit (e.g., ``turn the dress blue'' or ``remove
stripes'') to a reference image. Zero-shot CIR, which embeds the image and the
text with separate pretrained vision-language encoders, reaches only 20-25\%
Recall@10 on the FashionIQ benchmark. We improve this by fine-tuning BLIP-2
with a lightweight Q-Former that fuses visual and textual features into a
single embedding, raising Recall@10 to 45.6\% (shirt), 40.1\% (dress), and
50.4\% (top-tee) and increasing the average Recall@50 to 67.6\%. We also
examine Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a Direct
Preference Optimization loss applied to FAISS-mined hard negatives. Despite
extensive tuning of the scaling factor, index, and sampling strategy,
Retrieval-DPO attains only 0.02\% Recall@10 -- far below zero-shot and
prompt-tuned baselines -- because it (i) lacks joint image-text fusion, (ii)
uses a margin objective misaligned with top-$K$ metrics, (iii) relies on
low-quality negatives, and (iv) keeps the vision and Transformer layers frozen.
Our results show that effective preference-based CIR requires genuine
multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and carefully curated negatives.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of
real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by
limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity,
which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2)
limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for
educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with
minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task
process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset
that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset
includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific
instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises
620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety
of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis,
etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to
highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We
expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained
visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering
closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies. The
dataset and the evaluation toolkit are publicly available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the dark channel as a complementary cue to estimate
the depth of a scene from a single space-variant defocus blurred image due to
its effectiveness in implicitly capturing the local statistics of blurred
images and the scene structure. Existing depth-from-defocus (DFD) techniques
typically rely on multiple images with varying apertures or focus settings to
recover depth information. Very few attempts have focused on DFD from a single
defocused image due to the underconstrained nature of the problem. Our method
capitalizes on the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast
variations as key depth cues to enhance the overall performance in estimating
the scene's structure. The entire pipeline is trained adversarially in a fully
end-to-end fashion. Experiments conducted on real data with realistic
depth-induced defocus blur demonstrate that incorporating dark channel prior
into single image DFD yields meaningful depth estimation results, validating
the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Photorealistic and animatable human avatars are a key enabler for
virtual/augmented reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering
quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges,
including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under
sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human
Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human
priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from
monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent
identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance
into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that
predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and
view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust
rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing
efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long
optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient
than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes
per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby
demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar
creation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces
leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present
after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying
flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study,
Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework
purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture
fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical
basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure
probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even
when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a
semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded
building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints.
Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County,
Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean
F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines,
with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate"
damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the
single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end
post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable,
building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining
risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense
delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to
support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

Motivation: Infertility affects quality of life and IVF is a primary technique, but traditional grading is time-consuming. Blastocyst images are useful but need efficient analysis.

Method: The study proposes a CNN-LSTM fusion model for embryo classification, using deep learning with XAI for interpretability.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy in embryo classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM framework offers an efficient and accurate solution for embryo grading in IVF, potentially improving treatment outcomes.

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life,
affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise
in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the
primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address
the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade
embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer,
yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images
provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we
introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for
classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM.
Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo
classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Abstract: Omnidirectional image and video super-resolution is a crucial research topic
in low-level vision, playing an essential role in virtual reality and augmented
reality applications. Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or
video frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation
and enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years,
numerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly
based on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures,
loss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper
presents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and
video super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that
existing datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in
capturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that
comprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected
under diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure
settings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional
benchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization
capabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on
both public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a
systematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising
directions for future exploration. All datasets, methods, and evaluation

segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows
and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations
and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance
function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic
dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth
Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion
near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta
algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the
above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and
HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise
resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of
initial velocities and initial contours.

Abstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters
between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying
individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five
African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species.
The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a
closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their
predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To
this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric
contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and
projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare
our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show
feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying
classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features
achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the
best OOD methods, respectively. The code can be found here

*Zixian Gao,Chao Yang,Zhanhui Zhou,Xing Xu,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Local Perception Search (LPS), a training-free decoding method that uses local visual priors to suppress hallucinations in MLLMs, showing significant reduction in hallucinations, especially in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucination issues in MLLMs where outputs don't align with image content, despite their success in integrating vision and language.

Method: Local Perception Search (LPS) leverages local visual prior information as a value function to correct decoding during inference, without requiring additional training.

Result: LPS significantly reduces hallucinations compared to baseline models, with more noticeable improvements in high-noise scenarios.

Conclusion: LPS is a simple, training-free, plug-and-play method compatible with various models, effectively mitigating hallucinations, especially in noisy data settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of
downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models
still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but
do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference
that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses
hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value
function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the
impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in
scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play
approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on
widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS
significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline,
showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

Abstract: To translate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into interpretable forms
for human understanding is the ultimate goal of SAR advanced information
retrieval. Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local
geometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural
modeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task:
SAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target
and the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry
and adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural
consistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed
in different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of
target directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a
two-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed.
Specifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real
SAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical
structures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are
integrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results
validated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time,
that 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly
derived from a single-view SAR image.

Abstract: Biometric authentication systems are increasingly being deployed in critical
applications, but they remain susceptible to spoofing. Since most of the
research efforts focus on modality-specific anti-spoofing techniques, building
a unified, resource-efficient solution across multiple biometric modalities
remains a challenge. To address this, we propose LitMAS, a
$\textbf{Li}$gh$\textbf{t}$ weight and generalizable $\textbf{M}$ulti-modal
$\textbf{A}$nti-$\textbf{S}$poofing framework designed to detect spoofing
attacks in speech, face, iris, and fingerprint-based biometric systems. At the
core of LitMAS is a Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss, which enhances
inter-class separability while preserving cross-modal consistency and enabling
robust spoof detection across diverse biometric traits. With just 6M
parameters, LitMAS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by $1.36\%$ in average
EER across seven datasets, demonstrating high efficiency, strong
generalizability, and suitability for edge deployment. Code and trained models

dataset comprising over 1000 images captured across diverse environments,
including parks, indoor scenes, parking spaces, as well as centered around
individual objects. Each scene is represented by a sequence of five consecutive
images. The dataset was collected using a high resolution camera, providing
suitable imagery for benchmarking the accuracy of loop closure algorithms,
typically used in simultaneous localization and mapping. As ground truth
information, we provide computed rotations and translations between each
consecutive images. Additional to its benchmarking goal, the dataset can be

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer
vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor
observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by
complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term
forecasting. This work proposes modeling continuous-time rotational object
dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by
Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion
assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the
underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of
rotations. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate compelling
forecasting capabilities compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized image synthesis using diffusion models, with techniques like Mosaic Restored Content Image and a content consistency loss to improve identity retention and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing style transfer techniques in maintaining identity, especially in images with small faces or large camera-to-face distances.

Method: The method includes the Mosaic Restored Content Image technique and a training-free content consistency loss that focuses on the original image during stylization.

Result: The experiments show the approach outperforms the baseline in maintaining high stylistic fidelity and identity integrity without retraining the model.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed method effectively enhances identity preservation in stylized images using diffusion models, even under challenging conditions.

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities,
existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while
achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation is particularly acute for
images where faces are small or exhibit significant camera-to-face distances,
frequently leading to inadequate identity preservation. To address this, we
introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized
image synthesis using diffusion models. Key contributions include: (1) the
"Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, significantly enhancing identity
retention, especially in complex scenes; and (2) a training-free content
consistency loss that enhances the preservation of fine-grained content details
by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our
experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially surpasses the
baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust
identity integrity, particularly under conditions of small facial regions or
significant camera-to-face distances, all without necessitating model
retraining or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for
various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each
object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims
to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic
prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to
Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical
issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text
prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic
captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2)
\textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in
getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global
background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation,
causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we
propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework
that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream
\textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal
\textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT
progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity,
while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently
samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively
mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any
training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation
result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than
previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language
queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based
models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but
lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies.
Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in
object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic
understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent
Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying.
To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features
to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered
instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D
semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise
contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations.
Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the
model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments
highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and
localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets
underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D
scenes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown
its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP
from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the
scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be
successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between
robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process?
If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to
mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three
questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To
mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt
Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally
compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of
robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly
enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets.
Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are
universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an attention-level control method for coupled image generation, allowing multiple images to share similar backgrounds while maintaining object flexibility through different text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to achieve consistent backgrounds across multiple images generated simultaneously, while still allowing variation in the centered objects based on different text prompts.

Method: The method involves disentangling background and entity components in cross-attention modules with time-varying weight control parameters, optimized using a combined objective that evaluates background coupling, text-to-image alignment, and visual quality.

Result: Empirical results show the method outperforms existing approaches in terms of background consistency, text-to-image alignment, and overall visual quality.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed method effectively controls attention levels in coupled image generation, achieving better performance across multiple criteria compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image
generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images
are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds
coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to
enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method
disentangles the background and entity components in the model's
cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight
control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this
sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses
how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall
visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches across these criteria.

Abstract: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally

and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes,
characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and
confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges
for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often
struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in
each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task
learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance
overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel
multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery
activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2
foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate
efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank
Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we
introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature
representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global
information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we
present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored
for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity
recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks,
significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing
models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of
fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior
methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical
data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to
identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on
vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs
for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has
fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for
TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening
stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which
leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate
anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal
context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates
provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS
outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,
yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.
Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based
TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene
to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes.
While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method
for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to
stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style
transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for
stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization
solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we
employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify
correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered
images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style
loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to
various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to
enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve
memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To
better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several
techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our
comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing
plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.

Abstract: Inertial-based Motion capture system has been attracting growing attention
due to its wearability and unsconstrained use. However, accurate human joint
estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads
to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens
Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract
the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose
estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network
architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can
estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda)
Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method
was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle
distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was
conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation,
window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error.
This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose,
with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation
applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While
self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown
promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental
aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a
position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite
imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of
satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to
multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and
introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction
during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction,
encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We
evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it
significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised
learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position
prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn
representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than
reconstruction-based approaches.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DONUT, a decoder-only model for predicting agent motion in autonomous driving, using autoregressive decoding and overprediction to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of other agents' motion is crucial for autonomous driving to enable anticipation. Existing encoder-decoder models have limitations in providing up-to-date information and consistent iterative predictions.

Method: DONUT is a decoder-only network that encodes historical trajectories and predicts future ones autoregressively. It employs an 'overprediction' strategy to predict longer-term trajectories as an auxiliary task.

Result: The decoder-only approach of DONUT outperforms encoder-decoder baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

Conclusion: By using a decoder-only architecture with autoregressive decoding and overprediction, DONUT enhances motion prediction accuracy, which is vital for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for
autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by
the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a
Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing
encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and
predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the
model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that
the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the
performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language
modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the
auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This
allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the
performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach
outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art
results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual reasoning is crucial for understanding complex multimodal data and
advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Existing methods enhance the
reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through
Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning (e.g., GRPO). However, current RL
approaches sample action groups solely from the policy model itself, which
limits the upper boundary of the model's reasoning capability and leads to
inefficient training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
RL framework called \textbf{Vision-EKIPL}. The core of this framework lies in
introducing high-quality actions generated by external auxiliary models during
the RL training process to guide the optimization of the policy model. The
policy learning with knowledge infusion from external models significantly
expands the model's exploration space, effectively improves the reasoning
boundary, and substantially accelerates training convergence speed and
efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Vision-EKIPL
achieved up to a 5\% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark
compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It reveals that Vision-EKIPL can
overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, significantly enhance the
visual reasoning performance of MLLMs, and provide a new effective paradigm for
research in this field.

*Junyu Liu,Jianfeng Ren,Sunhong Liang,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an end-to-end 3D face recognition method that integrates denoising and recognition using cGAN-TOP and LDGCNN, achieving 14.81% accuracy improvement on Bosphorus dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw 3D point clouds often have noise from sensors, which affects face recognition accuracy. The paper aims to address this by combining denoising and recognition in an end-to-end system.

Method: The method uses a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) for denoising and a Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) for recognition, linking local and neighboring features across multiple scales.

Result: The proposed method showed significant improvement in recognition accuracy across all noise conditions on the Bosphorus dataset, with a maximum gain of 14.81%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that integrating denoising and recognition modules in an end-to-end manner enhances 3D face recognition performance, particularly in noisy environments.

Abstract: Face recognition using 3D point clouds is gaining growing interest, while raw
point clouds often contain a significant amount of noise due to imperfect
sensors. In this paper, an end-to-end 3D face recognition on a noisy point
cloud is proposed, which synergistically integrates the denoising and
recognition modules. Specifically, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) is designed to effectively remove the
noise in the point cloud, and recover the underlying features for subsequent
recognition. A Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) is
then adapted to recognize faces from the processed point cloud, which
hierarchically links both the local point features and neighboring features of
multiple scales. The proposed method is validated on the Bosphorus dataset. It
significantly improves the recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with
a maximum gain of 14.81%.

Abstract: Accurate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis is vital for early

Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired
with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a
large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled
unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent
models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.
Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on
mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement
because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower
signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to
mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and
brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally
generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source
visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et
al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on
mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction.
We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact
cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding
architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental
imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our
findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development
of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for
better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
analyzing 3D point cloud data. However, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge
to the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the
semantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing
defense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named
KNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and
nearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface
geometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores
perturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples
from the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally
efficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and
practical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset
demonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various
attack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing
methods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the
proposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on
PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively. These findings suggest that
KNN-Defense offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the
adversarial resilience of 3D point cloud classifiers. (An open-source
implementation of the method, including code and data, is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GaME, a dynamic scene adaptation mechanism for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems, improving accuracy in evolving scenes by updating 3D representations and managing keyframes to maintain consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting systems are limited to static scenes and struggle with long-term dynamics, necessitating a solution for continuous scene updates and maintaining geometric/semantic consistency.

Method: GaME employs a dynamic scene adaptation mechanism to continuously update 3D representations and a novel keyframe management system to discard outdated observations while preserving essential data.

Result: GaME outperforms existing methods in accuracy when evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets for 3D mapping with long-term dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that GaME effectively addresses long-term dynamics in 3D mapping, offering improved accuracy and consistency through continuous adaptation and keyframe management.

Abstract: Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used
in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving
applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS
performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes.
While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within
the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes
out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D
representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining
geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale
observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe
management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as
much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes
(GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more
accurate than the state of the art.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for diagnosing sleep
disorders, particularly in aging populations. While traditional polysomnography
(PSG) relies on electroencephalography (EEG) as the gold standard, its
complexity and need for specialized equipment make home-based sleep monitoring
challenging. To address this limitation, we investigate the use of
electrooculography (EOG) and pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) as less obtrusive
alternatives for five-stage sleep-wake classification. This study introduces a
novel approach that leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning
model, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage
classification. Our method is the first reported approach that fuses PSM and
EOG data for sleep stage classification with ImageBind. Our results demonstrate
that fine-tuning ImageBind significantly improves classification accuracy,
outperforming existing models based on single-channel EOG (DeepSleepNet),
exclusively PSM data (ViViT), and other multimodal deep learning approaches
(MBT). Notably, the model also achieved strong performance without fine-tuning,
highlighting its adaptability to specific tasks with limited labeled data,
making it particularly advantageous for medical applications. We evaluated our
method using 85 nights of patient recordings from a sleep clinic. Our findings
suggest that pre-trained multimodal embedding models, even those originally
developed for non-medical domains, can be effectively adapted for sleep
staging, with accuracies approaching systems that require complex EEG data.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an event-based OCR approach for smart glasses that reduces bandwidth by 98% and improves text reading in low light and high-speed scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current smart glasses with RGB cameras have issues with motion blur and limited dynamic range in low-light and high-speed environments, plus high bandwidth and power needs for dense images, which hinder effective text reading algorithms.

Method: The method uses eye gaze to foveate the event stream, reducing bandwidth, and employs deep binary reconstruction on synthetic data with multimodal LLMs for OCR.

Result: The approach successfully reads text in low light where RGB cameras fail and uses 2400 times less bandwidth than traditional RGB cameras.

Conclusion: The proposed event-based OCR method offers significant improvements in efficiency and performance for smart glasses in challenging visual conditions.

Abstract: Current smart glasses equipped with RGB cameras struggle to perceive the
environment in low-light and high-speed motion scenarios due to motion blur and
the limited dynamic range of frame cameras. Additionally, capturing dense
images with a frame camera requires large bandwidth and power consumption,
consequently draining the battery faster. These challenges are especially
relevant for developing algorithms that can read text from images. In this
work, we propose a novel event-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
approach for smart glasses. By using the eye gaze of the user, we foveate the
event stream to significantly reduce bandwidth by around 98% while exploiting
the benefits of event cameras in high-dynamic and fast scenes. Our proposed
method performs deep binary reconstruction trained on synthetic data and
leverages multimodal LLMs for OCR, outperforming traditional OCR solutions. Our
results demonstrate the ability to read text in low light environments where
RGB cameras struggle while using up to 2400 times less bandwidth than a
wearable RGB camera.

Abstract: Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with
numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these
models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both
image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings
indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after
image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from
video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that
image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm
perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning
benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving
sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities.
This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and
occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests
suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current
models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow
image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the
bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles,
where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR
sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full
360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming
approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native
polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions
that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or
requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models
(SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan
setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are
memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical
Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming
LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial
encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling,
replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware,
dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among
streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best
by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput. Code will be

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models unifying image understanding
and generation have opened exciting avenues for tackling a wide range of
vision-language tasks within a single framework. Despite progress, existing
unified models typically require extensive pretraining and struggle to achieve
the same level of performance compared to models dedicated to each task.
Additionally, many of these models suffer from slow image generation speeds,
limiting their practical deployment in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. In this work, we propose Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based
Transformer (LaTtE-Flow), a novel and efficient architecture that unifies image
understanding and generation within a single multimodal model. LaTtE-Flow
builds upon powerful pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to inherit strong
multimodal understanding capabilities, and extends them with a novel Layerwise
Timestep Experts flow-based architecture for efficient image generation.
LaTtE-Flow distributes the flow-matching process across specialized groups of
Transformer layers, each responsible for a distinct subset of timesteps. This
design significantly improves sampling efficiency by activating only a small
subset of layers at each sampling timestep. To further enhance performance, we
propose a Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism for efficient
information reuse across layers. Experiments demonstrate that LaTtE-Flow
achieves strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks, while achieving
competitive image generation quality with around 6x faster inference speed
compared to recent unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution refers to the reconstruction of a
high-resolution image from a single low-resolution observation. Although recent
deep learning-based methods have demonstrated notable success on simulated
datasets -- with low-resolution images obtained by degrading and downsampling
high-resolution ones -- they frequently fail to generalize to real-world
settings, such as document scans, which are affected by complex degradations
and semantic variability. In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task
learning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically
optimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate
auxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text
detection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a
convolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net,
and hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic
weight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of
each loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon
the SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for
single-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and
real-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while
preserving overall image fidelity. These findings underscore the value of
multi-objective optimization in super-resolution models for bridging the gap
between simulated training regimes and practical deployment in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm
that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest
neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a
single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation
on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each
generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and
incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model
to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g.,
over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize
AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in
Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly
merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of
retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features
of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them
to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of
AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and
DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art
image generation models.

Abstract: Due to the emergence of many sign language datasets, isolated sign language
recognition (ISLR) has made significant progress in recent years. In addition,
the development of various advanced deep neural networks is another reason for
this breakthrough. However, challenges remain in applying the technique in the
real world. First, existing sign language datasets do not cover the whole sign
vocabulary. Second, most of the sign language datasets provide only single view
RGB videos, which makes it difficult to handle hand occlusions when performing
ISLR. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dual-view sign language dataset
for ISLR named NationalCSL-DP, which fully covers the Chinese national sign
language vocabulary. The dataset consists of 134140 sign videos recorded by ten
signers with respect to two vertical views, namely, the front side and the left
side. Furthermore, a CNN transformer network is also proposed as a strong
baseline and an extremely simple but effective fusion strategy for prediction.
Extensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the datasets
as well as the baseline. The results show that the proposed fusion strategy can
significantly increase the performance of the ISLR, but it is not easy for the
sequence-to-sequence model, regardless of whether the early-fusion or
late-fusion strategy is applied, to learn the complementary features from the
sign videos of two vertical views.

Abstract: Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability
to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in
its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs
(Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality
alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified
architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality
alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We
introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel
framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to
guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning
process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic
preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative
Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our
preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained
cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced
semantic distinctions.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid 3D Gaussian splatting and textured mesh representation for indoor scenes, improving rendering efficiency by using meshes for texture-rich areas and Gaussians for complex geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of 3D Gaussian splatting in rendering regions with complex textures, which require many Gaussians and thus slow down the process.

Method: The method involves pruning and refining the mesh to remove complex geometries, followed by joint optimization of 3DGS and mesh with a warm-up strategy and transmittance-aware supervision.

Result: The hybrid approach maintains high rendering quality while achieving higher FPS with fewer Gaussians, as shown by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that combining 3DGS with textured meshes effectively improves efficiency without sacrificing quality for indoor scene reconstruction and rendering.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated exceptional performance in
image-based 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, regions with
complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color
variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address
this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that
combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle
texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate
geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted
mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint
optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and
transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions
seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation
maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second
FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for
understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs).
However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit
weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods
improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform
gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully
leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the
same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing
perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing
those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve
transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient
optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality
Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low
frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset
tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS
employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated
gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer
success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: Dual-camera super-resolution is practical for smartphone photography, but existing methods struggle with domain gaps and transferring high-frequency details from telephoto to wide-angle images.

Method: DM$^3$Net uses Domain Modulation to learn compressed global representations from image pairs across high-resolution and degraded domains, and a Multi-scale Matching module for patch-level feature matching. Key Pruning reduces memory and inference time with minimal performance loss.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show DM$^3$Net outperforms existing methods in dual-camera super-resolution.

Conclusion: DM$^3$Net effectively addresses domain gaps and enables efficient transfer of high-frequency details, leading to superior performance in dual-camera super-resolution for smartphone photography.

Abstract: Dual-camera super-resolution is highly practical for smartphone photography
that primarily super-resolve the wide-angle images using the telephoto image as
a reference. In this paper, we propose DM$^3$Net, a novel dual-camera
super-resolution network based on Domain Modulation and Multi-scale Matching.
To bridge the domain gap between the high-resolution domain and the degraded
domain, we learn two compressed global representations from image pairs
corresponding to the two domains. To enable reliable transfer of high-frequency
structural details from the reference image, we design a multi-scale matching
module that conducts patch-level feature matching and retrieval across multiple
receptive fields to improve matching accuracy and robustness. Moreover, we also
introduce Key Pruning to achieve a significant reduction in memory usage and
inference time with little model performance sacrificed. Experimental results
on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DM$^3$Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo. Moreover,
BePo also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest
efficient approaches.

Abstract: This work presents UNO, a unified monocular visual odometry framework that
enables robust and adaptable pose estimation across diverse environments,
platforms, and motion patterns. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
deployment-specific tuning or predefined motion priors, our approach
generalizes effectively across a wide range of real-world scenarios, including
autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, mobile robots, and handheld devices. To
this end, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy for local state
estimation, with several specialized decoders that each handle a distinct class
of ego-motion patterns. Moreover, we introduce a fully differentiable
Gumbel-Softmax module that constructs a robust inter-frame correlation graph,
selects the optimal expert decoder, and prunes erroneous estimates. These cues
are then fed into a unified back-end that combines pre-trained,
scale-independent depth priors with a lightweight bundling adjustment to
enforce geometric consistency. We extensively evaluate our method on three
major benchmark datasets: KITTI (outdoor/autonomous driving), EuRoC-MAV
(indoor/aerial drones), and TUM-RGBD (indoor/handheld), demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual
understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex
reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video
question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per
query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale,
audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal
is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query
and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we
present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA
pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and
temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent
framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65%
relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores
in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of
multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation,
we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a
ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and
interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance. Project:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand
for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches
often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without
providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit
strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they
can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.
However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to
align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images
annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis
artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded
reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy
that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual
localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves
superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing
visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Abstract: Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by
satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low
accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive
microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This
challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which
aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals
beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a
two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling
stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to
an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and
Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune
refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc
infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate
that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance,
outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code
will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.

Abstract: We introduce Layered Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (LSSKD) framework
for training compact deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods that rely
on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and
enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method
achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD
method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on
ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under
few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model
generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized
teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary
classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes
our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable
low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our
framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical
environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates
the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory

Abstract: The robustness of Deep Neural Network models is crucial for defending models
against adversarial attacks. Recent defense methods have employed collaborative
learning frameworks to enhance model robustness. Two key limitations of
existing methods are (i) insufficient guidance of the target model via loss
functions and (ii) non-collaborative adversarial generation. We, therefore,
propose a dual regularization loss (D2R Loss) method and a collaborative
adversarial generation (CAG) strategy for adversarial training. D2R loss
includes two optimization steps. The adversarial distribution and clean
distribution optimizations enhance the target model's robustness by leveraging
the strengths of different loss functions obtained via a suitable function
space exploration to focus more precisely on the target model's distribution.
CAG generates adversarial samples using a gradient-based collaboration between
guidance and target models. We conducted extensive experiments on three
benchmark databases, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and two
popular target models, WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18. Our results show
that D2R loss with CAG produces highly robust models.

Abstract: The growing availability of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) data enables

challenges. To address this, the French National Institute of Geographical and
Forest Information (IGN) is actively exploring innovative strategies to exploit
diverse EO data, which require large annotated datasets. IGN introduces
FLAIR-HUB, the largest multi-sensor land cover dataset with

combines six aligned modalities: aerial imagery, Sentinel-1/2 time series, SPOT
imagery, topographic data, and historical aerial images. Extensive benchmarks
evaluate multimodal fusion and deep learning models (CNNs, transformers) for
land cover or crop mapping and also explore multi-task learning. Results
underscore the complexity of multimodal fusion and fine-grained classification,
with best land cover performance (78.2% accuracy, 65.8% mIoU) achieved using
nearly all modalities. FLAIR-HUB supports supervised and multimodal

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Unsupervised Camoflaged Object Detection (UCOD) has gained attention since it
doesn't need to rely on extensive pixel-level labels. Existing UCOD methods
typically generate pseudo-labels using fixed strategies and train 1 x1
convolutional layers as a simple decoder, leading to low performance compared
to fully-supervised methods. We emphasize two drawbacks in these approaches:
1). The model is prone to fitting incorrect knowledge due to the pseudo-label
containing substantial noise. 2). The simple decoder fails to capture and learn
the semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized
objects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between
foreground and background pixels. To this end, we propose a UCOD method with a
teacher-student framework via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning called UCOD-DPL,
which contains an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial
(DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism. The APM module adaptively combines
pseudo-labels generated by fixed strategies and the teacher model to prevent
the model from overfitting incorrect knowledge while preserving the ability for
self-correction; the DBA decoder takes adversarial learning of different
segmentation objectives, guides the model to overcome the foreground-background
confusion of camouflaged objects, and the Look-Twice mechanism mimics the human
tendency to zoom in on camouflaged objects and performs secondary refinement on
small-sized objects. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates
outstanding performance, even surpassing some existing fully supervised
methods. The code is available now.

Abstract: Our project page: https://scutyklin.github.io/SceneLCM/. Automated generation
of complex, interactive indoor scenes tailored to user prompt remains a
formidable challenge. While existing methods achieve indoor scene synthesis,
they struggle with rigid editing constraints, physical incoherence, excessive
human effort, single-room limitations, and suboptimal material quality. To
address these limitations, we propose SceneLCM, an end-to-end framework that
synergizes Large Language Model (LLM) for layout design with Latent Consistency
Model(LCM) for scene optimization. Our approach decomposes scene generation
into four modular pipelines: (1) Layout Generation. We employ LLM-guided 3D
spatial reasoning to convert textual descriptions into parametric blueprints(3D
layout). And an iterative programmatic validation mechanism iteratively refines
layout parameters through LLM-mediated dialogue loops; (2) Furniture
Generation. SceneLCM employs Consistency Trajectory Sampling(CTS), a
consistency distillation sampling loss guided by LCM, to form fast,
semantically rich, and high-quality representations. We also offer two
theoretical justification to demonstrate that our CTS loss is equivalent to
consistency loss and its distillation error is bounded by the truncation error
of the Euler solver; (3) Environment Optimization. We use a multiresolution
texture field to encode the appearance of the scene, and optimize via CTS loss.
To maintain cross-geometric texture coherence, we introduce a normal-aware
cross-attention decoder to predict RGB by cross-attending to the anchors
locations in geometrically heterogeneous instance. (4)Physically Editing.
SceneLCM supports physically editing by integrating physical simulation,
achieved persistent physical realism. Extensive experiments validate SceneLCM's
superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, showing its wide-ranging
potential for diverse applications.

Abstract: Text spotting for industrial panels is a key task for intelligent monitoring.
However, achieving efficient and accurate text spotting for complex industrial
panels remains challenging due to issues such as cross-scale localization and
ambiguous boundaries in dense text regions. Moreover, most existing methods
primarily focus on representing a single text shape, neglecting a comprehensive
exploration of multi-scale feature information across different texts. To
address these issues, this work proposes a novel multi-scale dense text spotter
for edge AI-based vision system (EdgeSpotter) to achieve accurate and robust
industrial panel monitoring. Specifically, a novel Transformer with efficient
mixer is developed to learn the interdependencies among multi-level features,
integrating multi-layer spatial and semantic cues. In addition, a new feature
sampling with catmull-rom splines is designed, which explicitly encodes the
shape, position, and semantic information of text, thereby alleviating missed
detections and reducing recognition errors caused by multi-scale or dense text
regions. Furthermore, a new benchmark dataset for industrial panel monitoring
(IPM) is constructed. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
this challenging benchmark dataset validate the superior performance of the
proposed method in different challenging panel monitoring tasks. Finally,
practical tests based on the self-designed edge AI-based vision system
demonstrate the practicality of the method. The code and demo will be available

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have advanced video
generation, but existing methods fail to efficiently model spatio-temporal
redundancies in dynamics, resulting in suboptimal compression factors. This
shortfall leads to excessive training costs for downstream tasks. To address
this, we introduce Hi-VAE, an efficient video autoencoding framework that
hierarchically encode coarse-to-fine motion representations of video dynamics
and formulate the decoding process as a conditional generation task.
Specifically, Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into two latent spaces: Global
Motion, capturing overarching motion patterns, and Detailed Motion, encoding
high-frequency spatial details. Using separate self-supervised motion encoders,
we compress video latents into compact motion representations to reduce
redundancy significantly. A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs
videos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling
high-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Hi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\times$, almost 30$\times$
higher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\times$), validating the
efficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction
quality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream
generative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability,
providing new perspectives for future exploration in video latent
representation and generation.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges
due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic
complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore
the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision
token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial
Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token
sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile,
weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive
downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a
Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features
for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to
balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving
inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves
comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular
vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The

Abstract: We introduce GoTrack, an efficient and accurate CAD-based method for 6DoF
object pose refinement and tracking, which can handle diverse objects without
any object-specific training. Unlike existing tracking methods that rely solely
on an analysis-by-synthesis approach for model-to-frame registration, GoTrack
additionally integrates frame-to-frame registration, which saves compute and
stabilizes tracking. Both types of registration are realized by optical flow
estimation. The model-to-frame registration is noticeably simpler than in
existing methods, relying only on standard neural network blocks (a transformer
is trained on top of DINOv2) and producing reliable pose confidence scores
without a scoring network. For the frame-to-frame registration, which is an
easier problem as consecutive video frames are typically nearly identical, we
employ a light off-the-shelf optical flow model. We demonstrate that GoTrack
can be seamlessly combined with existing coarse pose estimation methods to
create a minimal pipeline that reaches state-of-the-art RGB-only results on
standard benchmarks for 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking. Our source

Abstract: The visual-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technology
widely used in applications such as robotic navigation and virtual reality,
which primarily focuses on detecting feature points from visual images to
construct an unknown environmental map and simultaneously determines its own
location. It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power
consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST
and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in
terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of
meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This
limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations
accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper
presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on
low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in
Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner
detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy
to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy
with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive
experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over
7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant
improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time
applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Frame Guidance offers an effective, training-free solution for controllable video generation, compatible with any video model, and shows promise for diverse applications.

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality,
directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing
methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks,
which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this
work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable
video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style
reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free
guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically
reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed
for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective
control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and
looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental
results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for
a wide range of tasks and input signals.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a dominant paradigm, yet its
highly entangled black-box models pose significant challenges in terms of
interpretability and safety assurance. To improve model transparency and
training flexibility, this paper proposes a hierarchical and decoupled
post-training framework tailored for pretrained neural networks. By
reconstructing intermediate feature maps from ground-truth labels, surrogate
supervisory signals are introduced at transitional layers to enable independent
training of specific components, thereby avoiding the complexity and coupling
of conventional end-to-end backpropagation and providing interpretable insights
into networks' internal mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first method to formalize feature-level reverse computation as well-posed
optimization problems, which we rigorously reformulate as systems of linear
equations or least squares problems. This establishes a novel and efficient
training paradigm that extends gradient backpropagation to feature
backpropagation. Extensive experiments on multiple standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior generalization performance and computational efficiency compared to
traditional training approaches, validating its effectiveness and potential.

Abstract: Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research.
The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action
sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical
capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates
in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to
ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to
distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon
procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.
To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality
dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform
interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from
the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and
introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the
1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five
fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152
strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next
action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that
leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current
surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected
surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the
broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,
Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction

Abstract: Video editing has garnered increasing attention alongside the rapid progress
of diffusion-based video generation models. As part of these advancements,
there is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video
editing, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused
on tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution,
and attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the
source video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel
objects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this
paper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing
framework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify
vital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the
quality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method
enables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively
injecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding
layers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition,
we further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding
to the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the
prominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental
results demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both
object addition and non-rigid video editing. Project Page:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance, but are also
vulnerable to backdoor attacks whereby the adversary can manipulate the model's
outputs through hidden triggers. Prior attacks primarily rely on
single-modality triggers, leaving the crucial cross-modal fusion nature of VLMs
largely unexplored. Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that
leverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers. Based on this
insight, we propose BadSem (Backdoor Attack with Semantic Manipulation), a data
poisoning attack that injects stealthy backdoors by deliberately misaligning
image-text pairs during training. To perform the attack, we construct SIMBad, a
dataset tailored for semantic manipulation involving color and object
attributes. Extensive experiments across four widely used VLMs show that BadSem
achieves over 98% average ASR, generalizes well to out-of-distribution
datasets, and can transfer across poisoning modalities. Our detailed analysis
using attention visualization shows that backdoored models focus on
semantically sensitive regions under mismatched conditions while maintaining
normal behavior on clean inputs. To mitigate the attack, we try two defense
strategies based on system prompt and supervised fine-tuning but find that both
of them fail to mitigate the semantic backdoor. Our findings highlight the
urgent need to address semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs for their safer
deployment.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial technique in deep learning, particularly for
tasks with limited dataset diversity, such as skeleton-based datasets. This
paper proposes a comprehensive data augmentation framework that integrates
geometric transformations, random cropping, rotation, zooming and
intensity-based transformations, brightness and contrast adjustments to
simulate real-world variations. Random cropping ensures the preservation of
spatio-temporal integrity while addressing challenges such as viewpoint bias
and occlusions. The augmentation pipeline generates three augmented versions
for each sample in addition to the data set sample, thus quadrupling the data
set size and enriching the diversity of gesture representations. The proposed
augmentation strategy is evaluated on three models: multi-stream e2eET, FPPR
point cloud-based hand gesture recognition (HGR), and DD-Network. Experiments
are conducted on benchmark datasets including DHG14/28, SHREC'17, and JHMDB.
The e2eET model, recognized as the state-of-the-art for hand gesture
recognition on DHG14/28 and SHREC'17. The FPPR-PCD model, the second-best
performing model on SHREC'17, excels in point cloud-based gesture recognition.
DD-Net, a lightweight and efficient architecture for skeleton-based action
recognition, is evaluated on SHREC'17 and the Human Motion Data Base (JHMDB).
The results underline the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed
augmentation strategy, significantly improving model generalization and
robustness across diverse datasets and architectures. This framework not only
establishes state-of-the-art results on all three evaluated models but also
offers a scalable solution to advance HGR and action recognition applications
in real-world scenarios. The framework is available at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences,
leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to
limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these
issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces
minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this
pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K
image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute,
count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss
that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our
approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully
balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual
variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference
detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines,
including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard
vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and
alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
capabilities by integrating visual perception with language understanding,
enabling applications such as image-grounded dialogue, visual question
answering, and scientific analysis. However, most MLLMs adopt a static
inference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront,
which limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to
context during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which
is dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform
iterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the
problem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual
actions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning
should terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising
supervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning
comparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches
across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy
but also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes. These results
demonstrate the promise of dynamic inference mechanisms for enabling
fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in next-generation MLLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, the explosion of web videos makes text-video retrieval
increasingly essential and popular for video filtering, recommendation, and
search. Text-video retrieval aims to rank relevant text/video higher than
irrelevant ones. The core of this task is to precisely measure the cross-modal
similarity between texts and videos. Recently, contrastive learning methods
have shown promising results for text-video retrieval, most of which focus on
the construction of positive and negative pairs to learn text and video
representations. Nevertheless, they do not pay enough attention to hard
negative pairs and lack the ability to model different levels of semantic
similarity. To address these two issues, this paper improves contrastive
learning using two novel techniques. First, to exploit hard examples for robust
discriminative power, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module
(DMAE) to mine hard negative pairs from textual and visual clues. By further
introducing a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss, we are able to adaptively
identify all these hard negatives and explicitly highlight their impacts in the
training loss. Second, our work argues that triplet samples can better model
fine-grained semantic similarity compared to pairwise samples. We thereby
present a new Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module to
construct partial order triplet samples by automatically generating
fine-grained hard negatives for matched text-video pairs. The proposed TPM-CL
designs an adaptive token masking strategy with cross-modal interaction to
model subtle semantic differences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms existing methods on four widely-used text-video
retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and ActivityNet.

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools,
capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their
potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training
dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally
pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit
understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal
knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs
for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task
into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short
input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen
VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization
across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose
estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results
reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual
learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation
models in vision.

Motivation: To explore the capabilities of VLMs beyond traditional tasks by applying them to reverse designing, which involves predicting edits and parameters from source and edited images along with text descriptions.

Method: Extending and fine-tuning MiniGPT-4, a pre-trained VLM, to handle reverse designing tasks through experiments.

Result: The experiments show that off-the-shelf VLMs like MiniGPT-4 can be extended and fine-tuned for complex tasks such as reverse designing.

Conclusion: The study concludes that VLMs have potential for more complex tasks beyond traditional ones, as demonstrated by MiniGPT-4's performance in reverse designing.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently seen significant advancements
through integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). The VLMs, which process
image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to
learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various
multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex
vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a
source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit
description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the
source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context
simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper,
we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our
experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically
MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing. Code is available

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse
problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as
Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update
per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in
embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a
multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly
enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our
experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that
increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with
minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin
Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally
trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes.
Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play
restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such

Abstract: Real-world surveillance often renders faces and license plates unrecognizable

advance temporal recognition models, we present FANVID, a novel video-based
benchmark comprising nearly 1,463 LR clips (180 x 320, 20--60 FPS) featuring 63
identities and 49 license plates from three English-speaking countries. Each
video includes distractor faces and plates, increasing task difficulty and
realism. The dataset contains 31,096 manually verified bounding boxes and
labels.
  FANVID defines two tasks: (1) face matching -- detecting LR faces and
matching them to high-resolution mugshots, and (2) license plate recognition --
extracting text from LR plates without a predefined database. Videos are
downsampled from high-resolution sources to ensure that faces and text are
indecipherable in single frames, requiring models to exploit temporal
information. We introduce evaluation metrics adapted from mean Average
Precision at IoU > 0.5, prioritizing identity correctness for faces and
character-level accuracy for text.
  A baseline method with pre-trained video super-resolution, detection, and
recognition achieved performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate
recognition), highlighting both the feasibility and challenge of the tasks.
FANVID's selection of faces and plates balances diversity with recognition
challenge. We release the software for data access, evaluation, baseline, and
annotation to support reproducibility and extension. FANVID aims to catalyze
innovation in temporal modeling for LR recognition, with applications in
surveillance, forensics, and autonomous vehicles.

high-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be
visualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach
corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the
next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques
from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs
iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates,
propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating
information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast
and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art
point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on
a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train on a wider set of
datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance. We provide
an extensive ablation study on our architecture details and training recipe,

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows

of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical limitations of existing saliency methods which may produce identical explanations for different class labels, questioning their reliability.

Method: The method involves creating a diagnostic test to evaluate class sensitivity and developing CASE, a contrastive approach to isolate discriminative features for the predicted class.

Result: The results show that many saliency methods are class-insensitive, with similar explanations across different labels, and that CASE performs better in providing faithful and class-specific explanations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that existing saliency methods have structural limitations in class sensitivity, and CASE offers a more reliable solution for generating accurate explanations.

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed
relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can
obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for
class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class
labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many
widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless
of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that
class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets,
suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated
by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that
isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate
CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and
show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than
existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the redundancy and inefficiency in existing IIN methods that rely on random viewpoint sampling, which leads to overlapping image samples and increased computational overhead.

Method: The method involves a hierarchical scoring paradigm that integrates cross-level semantic scoring using CLIP-derived relevancy fields and fine-grained local geometric scoring for precise pose estimation in promising regions.

Result: The results show that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and has real-world applicability.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed framework effectively reduces redundancy and improves navigation efficiency by using a principled approach to viewpoint selection.

Abstract: Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) requires autonomous agents to identify
and navigate to a target object or location depicted in a reference image
captured from any viewpoint. While recent methods leverage powerful novel view
synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or
trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues.
This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping
image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing
both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN
framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal
viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic
scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high
semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local
geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising
regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and real-world

Abstract: Object detection is vital in precision agriculture for plant monitoring,

features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention
Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant
spatial and channel-wise features.
  On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model
outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction
in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility
and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS
regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection
performance.
  This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge
deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate
and efficient monitoring.

Abstract: Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable
progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on
the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the
unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct
the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the
objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence,
compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional
object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations.
In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each
object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for
complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised
representation performance on both single object centric images and
multi-object ones. The source code is available at

Abstract: For the immanent challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in the medical
field, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a promising
solution. Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target
areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle
details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic
inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised
segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition
and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary
delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an
$\textit{Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning}$ module dedicated to refining
boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a $\textit{Dynamic
Complementary Competition}$ module that leverages two high-performing
sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation
quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly
accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to
previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our
approach achieves a notable improvement of at least $6\%$, highlighting the
significant advancements. The code is available at

Abstract: The rise of deep generative models has greatly advanced video compression,
reshaping the paradigm of face video coding through their powerful capability
for semantic-aware representation and lifelike synthesis. Generative Face Video
Coding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could
characterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream
compactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models
to reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at
the decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable
high-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far
surpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC)
standard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of
GFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies,
systematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and
industrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of
existing GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization
strategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we
construct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective
Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the
most appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the
GFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a
low-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future
practical deployments and applications. Finally, we envision the potential of
GFVC in industrial applications and deliberate on the current challenges and
future opportunities.

TL;DR: ARGUS is a new benchmark for evaluating Video-LLMs by measuring hallucinations and omission rates in video captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-LLMs often hallucinate, and existing benchmarks using multiple-choice questions don't adequately capture this issue in freeform text generation tasks like video captioning.

Method: ARGUS compares VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions to quantify two metrics: hallucination rate (incorrect statements about video content/temporal relationships) and omission rate (missing important descriptive details).

Result: ARGUS provides a comprehensive evaluation of VideoLLM performance by measuring both hallucination and omission rates in video captioning.

Conclusion: The authors propose ARGUS as a more effective benchmark for assessing VideoLLMs, highlighting the importance of addressing hallucinations and detail omission in video captioning tasks.

Abstract: Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to
their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on
multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more
aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they
do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose
ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning
performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions,
ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in
the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships.
Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive
details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video
captioning performance.

Abstract: Collaborative perception plays a crucial role in enhancing environmental
understanding by expanding the perceptual range and improving robustness
against sensor failures, which primarily involves collaborative 3D detection
and tracking tasks. The former focuses on object recognition in individual
frames, while the latter captures continuous instance tracklets over time.
However, existing works in both areas predominantly focus on the vehicle
superclass, lacking effective solutions for both multi-class collaborative
detection and tracking. This limitation hinders their applicability in
real-world scenarios, which involve diverse object classes with varying
appearances and motion patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework tailored for diverse
road users. We first present a detector with a global spatial attention fusion
(GSAF) module, enhancing multi-scale feature learning for objects of varying
sizes. Next, we introduce a tracklet RE-IDentification (REID) module that
leverages visual semantics with a vision foundation model to effectively reduce
ID SWitch (IDSW) errors, in cases of erroneous mismatches involving small
objects like pedestrians. We further design a velocity-based adaptive tracklet
management (VATM) module that adjusts the tracking interval dynamically based
on object motion. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets show
that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in both detection and tracking accuracy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the
model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the
model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for
efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the
domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we
revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not
explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of
downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.
Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's
inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.
Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),
which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current
works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's
attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential
excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further
design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific
knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to
learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly
by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large
vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their
increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge
databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection.
However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access
to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks,
particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods
targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the
visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG
systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by
counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to
retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership
information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method
to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval.
Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to
prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the
interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we
perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract
features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response
patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial
visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves
consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level
evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large models in resource-constrained
environments has underscored the need for efficient transmission of
intermediate feature representations. In this context, feature coding, which
compresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for
scenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this
compression process introduces inherent semantic degradation that is
notoriously difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this,
this paper introduces the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality
Assessment (CFQA), which seeks to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed
features. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset,
comprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from
three vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance drops are
provided as true semantic distortion for the evaluation of CFQA metrics. We
assess the performance of three widely used metrics (MSE, cosine similarity,
and Centered Kernel Alignment) in capturing semantic degradation. The results
underscore the representativeness of the dataset and highlight the need for
more refined metrics capable of addressing the nuances of semantic distortion
in compressed features. To facilitate the ongoing development of CFQA research,
we release the dataset and all accompanying source code at
\href{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}.
This contribution aims to advance the field and provide a foundational resource

Abstract: In continual learning, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem may make
the models fall into the stability-plasticity dilemma. Moreover, inter-task
confusion will also occur due to the lack of knowledge exchanges between
different tasks. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a
novel dynamic prompt transformer (DPFormer) with prompt schemes. The prompt
schemes help the DPFormer memorize learned knowledge of previous classes and
tasks, and keep on learning new knowledge from new classes and tasks under a
single network structure with a nearly fixed number of model parameters.
Moreover, they also provide discrepant information to represent different tasks
to solve the inter-task confusion problem. Based on prompt schemes, a unified
classification module with the binary cross entropy loss, the knowledge
distillation loss and the auxiliary loss is proposed to train the whole model
in an end-to-end trainable manner. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our
method achieves the best performance in the CIFAR-100, ImageNet100 and
ImageNet1K datasets under different class-incremental settings in continual
learning. The source code will be available at our GitHub after acceptance.

Abstract: Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise
biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces
significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models
are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt
to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly
evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.
Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image
segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address
these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent
viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were
designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve
the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized
residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and
enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information
and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different
optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental
validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best
segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.

Abstract: The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has
introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on
construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on
domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and
describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However,
despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited
investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks
within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a
comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,
GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify
potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested
under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought
(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated
basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided
step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative
analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all
conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced
performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across
models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with
GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also
demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and
consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study
offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs
for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more
reliable AI-assisted safety systems.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in motion capture and generative artificial

for synthesizing diverse, realistic human motions has become a promising
research direction. However, existing motion-capture techniques and generative
models often neglect physical constraints, leading to artifacts such as
interpenetration, sliding, and floating. These issues are exacerbated in
multi-person motion generation, where complex interactions are involved. To
address these limitations, we introduce physical mapping, integrated throughout
the human interaction generation pipeline. Specifically, motion imitation
within a physics-based simulation environment is used to project target motions
into a physically valid space. The resulting motions are adjusted to adhere to
real-world physics constraints while retaining their original semantic meaning.
This mapping not only improves MoCap data quality but also directly informs
post-processing of generated motions. Given the unique interactivity of
multi-person scenarios, we propose a tailored motion representation framework.
Motion Consistency (MC) and Marker-based Interaction (MI) loss functions are
introduced to improve model performance. Experiments show our method achieves
impressive results in generated human motion quality, with a 3%-89% improvement
in physical fidelity. Project page http://yw0208.github.io/physiinter

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap
between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing
methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic
accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the
entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition
for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language
and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered
sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose
GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level
conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as
sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This
enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and
word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for
fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second,
we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC),
to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided
by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method,
which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with
correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods
on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement
algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO
to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this
paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that
impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the
vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose
DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO
(Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO
reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the
advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping
and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning
the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data
augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable
difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our
comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video
reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval~(PRVR) aims to retrieve a video where a
specific segment is relevant to a given text query. Typical training processes
of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to
only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and
video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that
incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we
propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous
text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:
uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include
commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates
pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL
hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive
learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained
relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the
text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the
inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often
contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the
text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to
mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to
detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our
proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of prompt tuning in vision-language models, where frozen encoders lead to misaligned features and confusion between classes, limiting the model's effectiveness for specific tasks and unseen domains.

Method: The method involves introducing a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) to refine decision boundaries between confusing classes and using confidence-aware weights (CoA-weights) in a mixture model to improve generalization without sacrificing specialization.

Result: The experiments show that CoCoA-Mix outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing both task specialization and generalization, achieving better performance in adapted vision-language models.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that CoCoA-Mix effectively improves vision-language model adaptation through its combination of CoA-loss and CoA-weights, offering a promising approach for better performance in specific tasks and unseen domains.

Abstract: Prompt tuning, which adapts vision-language models by freezing model
parameters and optimizing only the prompt, has proven effective for
task-specific adaptations. The core challenge in prompt tuning is improving
specialization for a specific task and generalization for unseen domains.
However, frozen encoders often produce misaligned features, leading to
confusion between classes and limiting specialization. To overcome this issue,
we propose a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) that improves specialization by
refining the decision boundaries between confusing classes. Additionally, we
mathematically demonstrate that a mixture model can enhance generalization
without compromising specialization. This is achieved using confidence-aware
weights (CoA-weights), which adjust the weights of each prediction in the
mixture model based on its confidence within the class domains. Extensive
experiments show that CoCoA-Mix, a mixture model with CoA-loss and CoA-weights,
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing specialization and

Abstract: We propose DriveAnyMesh, a method for driving mesh guided by monocular video.
Current 4D generation techniques encounter challenges with modern rendering
engines. Implicit methods have low rendering efficiency and are unfriendly to
rasterization-based engines, while skeletal methods demand significant manual
effort and lack cross-category generalization. Animating existing 3D assets,
instead of creating 4D assets from scratch, demands a deep understanding of the
input's 3D structure. To tackle these challenges, we present a 4D diffusion
model that denoises sequences of latent sets, which are then decoded to produce
mesh animations from point cloud trajectory sequences. These latent sets
leverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing
3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal,
transformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple
latent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated
results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DriveAnyMesh can rapidly
produce high-quality animations for complex motions and is compatible with
modern rendering engines. This method holds potential for applications in both

  To train SpatialLM, we collect a large-scale, high-quality synthetic dataset
consisting of the point clouds of 12,328 indoor scenes (54,778 rooms) with
ground-truth 3D annotations, and conduct a careful study on various modeling
and training decisions. On public benchmarks, our model gives state-of-the-art
performance in layout estimation and competitive results in 3D object
detection. With that, we show a feasible path for enhancing the spatial
understanding capabilities of modern LLMs for applications in augmented
reality, embodied robotics, and more.

Abstract: We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view
driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal
consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a
DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR
generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are
directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution
across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured
semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on
vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level
supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that
Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics
(FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including
segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical
utility of the generated data.

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for
long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value
(KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated
promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization
methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this
paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via
mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization
bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts
(MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency
caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE
method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a
lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive
loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally,
we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to
further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV
cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper addresses key aspects of domain randomization in generating

present a comprehensive data generation pipeline that reflects different
factors: object characteristics, background, illumination, camera settings, and
post-processing. We also introduce the Synthetic Industrial Parts Object
Detection dataset (SIP15-OD) consisting of 15 objects from three industrial use
cases under varying environments as a test bed for the study, while also
employing an industrial dataset publicly available for robotic applications. In
our experiments, we present more abundant results and insights into the
feasibility as well as challenges of sim-to-real object detection. In
particular, we identified material properties, rendering methods,
post-processing, and distractors as important factors. Our method, leveraging
these, achieves top performance on the public dataset with Yolov8 models
trained exclusively on synthetic data; mAP@50 scores of 96.4% for the robotics
dataset, and 94.1%, 99.5%, and 95.3% across three of the SIP15-OD use cases,
respectively. The results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed domain
randomization, potentially covering the distribution close to real data for the
applications.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution, 3D, and
non-invasive visualization of retinal layers in vivo, serving as a critical
tool for lesion localization and disease diagnosis. However, its widespread
adoption is limited by equipment costs and the need for specialized operators.
In comparison, 2D color fundus photography offers faster acquisition and
greater accessibility with less dependence on expensive devices. Although
generative artificial intelligence has demonstrated promising results in
medical image synthesis, translating 2D fundus images into 3D OCT images
presents unique challenges due to inherent differences in data dimensionality
and biological information between modalities. To advance generative models in
the fundus-to-3D-OCT setting, the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society
(APTOS-2024) organized a challenge titled Artificial Intelligence-based OCT
Generation from Fundus Images. This paper details the challenge framework
(referred to as APTOS-2024 Challenge), including: the benchmark dataset,
evaluation methodology featuring two fidelity metrics-image-based distance
(pixel-level OCT B-scan similarity) and video-based distance (semantic-level
volumetric consistency), and analysis of top-performing solutions. The
challenge attracted 342 participating teams, with 42 preliminary submissions
and 9 finalists. Leading methodologies incorporated innovations in hybrid data
preprocessing or augmentation (cross-modality collaborative paradigms),
pre-training on external ophthalmic imaging datasets, integration of vision
foundation models, and model architecture improvement. The APTOS-2024 Challenge
is the first benchmark demonstrating the feasibility of fundus-to-3D-OCT
synthesis as a potential solution for improving ophthalmic care accessibility
in under-resourced healthcare settings, while helping to expedite medical
research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers
a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without
compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods
struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the
structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,
referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can
generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift
the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by
leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes
each private image into a concise textual description using image to text
models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP
text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI
requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a
private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality
than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less
than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private
Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less
than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine
tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private
Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model
compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images,
greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital pathology, virtual staining has become
a key technology in multimedia medical information systems, offering new
possibilities for the analysis and diagnosis of pathological images. However,
existing H&E-to-IHC studies often overlook the cross-channel correlations
between cell nuclei and cell membranes. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy. Specifically, CCPL
first decomposes HER2 immunohistochemical staining into Hematoxylin and DAB
staining channels, corresponding to cell nuclei and cell membranes,
respectively. Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder,
CCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and
measures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features
of the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder,
are also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's
feature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden.
Additionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density
maps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and
intensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR,
SSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists,
demonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates
high-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated
pathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.

Motivation: To address the challenges in music-driven dance generation, such as lack of fine-grained multimodal data and limited generation controllability and diversity.

Method: Developing OpenDance5D dataset with five modalities (RGB, audio, 2D/3D motion, text) and creating OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling approach for generating dance based on music and various text, keypoints, or character positions.

Result: OpenDanceNet shows high-fidelity and flexible controllability in dance generation through comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that OpenDance5D and OpenDanceNet contribute to advancing controllable and diverse music-driven dance generation.

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation offers significant creative potential yet faces
considerable challenges. The absence of fine-grained multimodal data and the
difficulty of flexible multi-conditional generation limit previous works on
generation controllability and diversity in practice. In this paper, we build
OpenDance5D, an extensive human dance dataset comprising over 101 hours across
14 distinct genres. Each sample has five modalities to facilitate robust
cross-modal learning: RGB video, audio, 2D keypoints, 3D motion, and
fine-grained textual descriptions from human arts. Furthermore, we propose
OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling framework for controllable dance
generation conditioned on music and arbitrary combinations of text prompts,
keypoints, or character positioning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenDanceNet achieves high-fidelity and flexible controllability.

Motivation: The paper aims to explore the impact of text quantity on writer retrieval performance, as existing research focuses mainly on page-level retrieval.

Method: The authors evaluate three state-of-the-art systems (both handcrafted and deep learning-based) on CVL and IAM datasets using varying text amounts (line- and word-level).

Result: Using one line of text results in 20-30% performance drop, but four lines maintain over 90% accuracy. Deep learning methods like NetVLAD outperform traditional VLAD in low-text scenarios.

Conclusion: Text-dependent retrieval can be effective even with limited text, and deep learning approaches are more robust in low-text conditions compared to handcrafted features.

Abstract: This paper investigates the task of writer retrieval, which identifies
documents authored by the same individual within a dataset based on handwriting
similarities. While existing datasets and methodologies primarily focus on page
level retrieval, we explore the impact of text quantity on writer retrieval
performance by evaluating line- and word level retrieval. We examine three
state-of-the-art writer retrieval systems, including both handcrafted and deep
learning-based approaches, and analyze their performance using varying amounts
of text. Our experiments on the CVL and IAM dataset demonstrate that while
performance decreases by 20-30% when only one line of text is used as query and
gallery, retrieval accuracy remains above 90% of full-page performance when at
least four lines are included. We further show that text-dependent retrieval
can maintain strong performance in low-text scenarios. Our findings also
highlight the limitations of handcrafted features in low-text scenarios, with
deep learning-based methods like NetVLAD outperforming traditional VLAD
encoding.

Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to
its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and
embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven
approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and
learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models.
Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high
computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by
coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization
to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout
generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines
synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline,
upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000
scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and
bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations.
We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor
layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our
two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then
conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II,
to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply
multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving
layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based
baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks
such as scene editing and robot navigation.

Abstract: Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip
movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual
features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color,
texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These
correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model
generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a
speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles
speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules
(Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve
generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic
consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same
words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as
supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers,
implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a
speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter
speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these
personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal.
Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances
generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization
performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), harnessing the complementarity among diverse
modalities, are often considered more robust than pure Language Large Models
(LLMs); yet do LMMs know what they do not know? There are three key open
questions remaining: (1) how to evaluate the uncertainty of diverse LMMs in a
unified manner, (2) how to prompt LMMs to show its uncertainty, and (3) how to
quantify uncertainty for downstream tasks. In an attempt to address these
challenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed
to reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or
capabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations
to uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the
formulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying
uncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks
spanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM
uncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination
detection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought
reasoning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world
modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently,
multi-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale
pretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different
modalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal
interactions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with
diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding
Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct
interactions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the
foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained
encoders as "super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association
(RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based
on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a
recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper
multi-modal interactions, for prompting various video understanding tasks in
downstream. Extensive experiments show that, our SEN can remarkably boost the
four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition,
chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard
index improves 2.7%, temporal coherence(TC) drops 8.8% compared to the popular
CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%,
and frame consistency increases 4.1% compared to the popular TuneA-Video
approach.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and

models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations,
sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content
that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security
threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic
images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This
enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial
attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without
needing access to the original training data. The generated images are
sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose
outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks,
including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement
of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the
query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the

Abstract: Despite recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for video
understanding, effectively understanding long-form video content remains
underexplored due to the vast scale and high complexity of video data. Current
RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often
disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture
authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize
continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified
framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into
narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal
metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through
lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework
fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity
relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop
retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments
on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content,
confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a
win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.

SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with

Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize

Abstract: Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by
directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention
from the community. However, it faces two key challenges:
(\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and
difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}})
current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision
and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce
high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new
perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of
user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly
specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity
issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region
Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward
Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while
further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure
information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform
existing approaches. Code will be released on github.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is often limited by the scarcity of labeled

mitigate this, recent work has explored generating virtual inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data via cross-modality transfer. While video-based and
language-based pipelines have each shown promise, they differ in assumptions
and computational cost. Moreover, their effectiveness relative to traditional
sensor-level data augmentation remains unclear. In this paper, we present a
direct comparison between these two virtual IMU generation approaches against
classical data augmentation techniques. We construct a large-scale virtual IMU
dataset spanning 100 diverse activities from Kinetics-400 and simulate sensor
signals at 22 body locations. The three data generation strategies are
evaluated on benchmark HAR datasets (UTD-MHAD, PAMAP2, HAD-AW) using four
popular models. Results show that virtual IMU data significantly improves
performance over real or augmented data alone, particularly under limited-data
conditions. We offer practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies
and highlight the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
substantially extended the boundaries of visual understanding capabilities.
However, their high computational demands hinder deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. A key source of inefficiency stems from the
VLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs
contain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the
associated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a
novel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core
contribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic
event vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition,
EP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB
visual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions
of the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving
tokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This
strategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while
accurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input.
Experimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency
improvements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline
models from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original
Qwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the
original accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset. This work demonstrates the
potential of event-based vision priors for improving VLM inference efficiency,
paving the way for creating more efficient and deployable VLMs for sustainable
visual understanding at the edge.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images is one of the most important tasks in
computer graphics. Unfortunately, existing datasets and benchmarks concentrate
on idealized synthetic or meticulously captured realistic data. Such benchmarks
fail to convey the inherent complexities encountered in newly acquired
real-world scenes. In such scenes especially those acquired outside, the
background is often dynamic, and by popular usage of cell phone cameras, there
might be discrepancies in, e.g., white balance. To address this gap, we present
HuSc3D, a novel dataset specifically designed for rigorous benchmarking of 3D
reconstruction models under realistic acquisition challenges. Our dataset
uniquely features six highly detailed, fully white sculptures characterized by
intricate perforations and minimal textural and color variation. Furthermore,
the number of images per scene varies significantly, introducing the additional
challenge of limited training data for some instances alongside scenes with a
standard number of views. By evaluating popular 3D reconstruction methods on
this diverse dataset, we demonstrate the distinctiveness of HuSc3D in
effectively differentiating model performance, particularly highlighting the
sensitivity of methods to fine geometric details, color ambiguity, and varying
data availability--limitations often masked by more conventional datasets.

Abstract: Automated pollen recognition is vital to paleoclimatology, biodiversity
monitoring, and public health, yet conventional methods are hampered by
inefficiency and subjectivity. Existing deep learning models often struggle to
achieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like
pollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and
complex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a
multi-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the
introduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),
which explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that
corresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic
Edge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic
information at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel
Module (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers
using an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel
convolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally
efficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset
comprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision
(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline
models such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms
that our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely
focused on object boundaries. By systematically integrating edge information,
HieraEdgeNet provides a robust and powerful solution for high-precision,
high-efficiency automated detection of microscopic objects.

Abstract: Reasoning over visual relationships-spatial, functional, interactional,
social, etc.-is considered to be a fundamental component of human cognition.
Yet, despite the major advances in visual comprehension in multimodal language
models (MLMs), precise reasoning over relationships and their generations
remains a challenge. We introduce ROBIN: an MLM instruction-tuned with densely
annotated relationships capable of constructing high-quality dense scene graphs
at scale. To train ROBIN, we curate SVG, a synthetic scene graph dataset by
completing the missing relations of selected objects in existing scene graphs
using a teacher MLM and a carefully designed filtering process to ensure
high-quality. To generate more accurate and rich scene graphs at scale for any
image, we introduce SG-EDIT: a self-distillation framework where GPT-4o further
refines ROBIN's predicted scene graphs by removing unlikely relations and/or
suggesting relevant ones. In total, our dataset contains 146K images and 5.6M
relationships for 2.6M objects. Results show that our ROBIN-3B model, despite
being trained on less than 3 million instances, outperforms similar-size models
trained on over 300 million instances on relationship understanding benchmarks,
and even surpasses larger models up to 13B parameters. Notably, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance in referring expression comprehension with a score
of 88.9, surpassing the previous best of 87.4. Our results suggest that
training on the refined scene graph data is crucial to maintaining high
performance across diverse visual reasoning task.

Abstract: Accurate lesion segmentation in histopathology images is essential for
diagnostic interpretation and quantitative analysis, yet it remains challenging
due to the limited availability of costly pixel-level annotations. To address
this, we propose FMaMIL, a novel two-stage framework for weakly supervised
lesion segmentation based solely on image-level labels. In the first stage, a
lightweight Mamba-based encoder is introduced to capture long-range
dependencies across image patches under the MIL paradigm. To enhance spatial
sensitivity and structural awareness, we design a learnable frequency-domain
encoding module that supplements spatial-domain features with spectrum-based
information. CAMs generated in this stage are used to guide segmentation
training. In the second stage, we refine the initial pseudo labels via a
CAM-guided soft-label supervision and a self-correction mechanism, enabling
robust training even under label noise. Extensive experiments on both public
and private histopathology datasets demonstrate that FMaMIL outperforms
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods without relying on pixel-level
annotations, validating its effectiveness and potential for digital pathology
applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated promising
results for novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, particularly
under narrow-baseline conditions. However, its performance significantly
degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and
geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for
high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage
involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second
stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement
model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion
model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view
Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI
supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference
view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency
using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer
training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through
joint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K
datasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that
ProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent
SOTA methods.

Conclusion: OpenSplat3D successfully extends 3DGS for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene understanding through semantic feature-splatting, SAM guidance, and language embeddings, without relying on manual labels.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
neural scene reconstruction, offering high-quality novel view synthesis while
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we extend the capabilities
of 3DGS beyond pure scene representation by introducing an approach for
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without requiring manual labeling,
termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to
associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained
scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with
a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve
accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language
embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven
instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and
segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.
We show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create 3D content from a single image but existing methods have problems with multi-view consistency and texture quality.

Method: NOVA3D uses a pretrained video diffusion model to get strong 3D priors and adds geometric info during multi-view video training. It has GTA attention for color and geometry exchange and a de-conflict geometry fusion to fix pose issues.

Result: Experiments show NOVA3D works better than other methods, with better multi-view consistency and texture details.

Conclusion: NOVA3D is a successful new framework for single-image 3D generation, using video models and special techniques to improve 3D content quality.

Abstract: 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) has made it increasingly accessible for anyone
to become a 3D content creator. While recent methods leverage Score
Distillation Sampling to distill 3D objects from pretrained image diffusion
models, they often suffer from inadequate 3D priors, leading to insufficient
multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce NOVA3D, an innovative
single-image-to-3D generation framework. Our key insight lies in leveraging
strong 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and integrating
geometric information during multi-view video fine-tuning. To facilitate
information exchange between color and geometric domains, we propose the
Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention mechanism, thereby improving
generalization and multi-view consistency. Moreover, we introduce the
de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm, which improves texture fidelity by
addressing multi-view inaccuracies and resolving discrepancies in pose
alignment. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NOVA3D over
existing baselines.

Abstract: Prior methodologies have disregarded the diversities among distinct
degradation types during image reconstruction, employing a uniform network
model to handle multiple deteriorations. Nevertheless, we discover that
prevalent degradation modalities, including sampling, blurring, and noise, can
be roughly categorized into two classes. We classify the first class as
spatial-agnostic dominant degradations, less affected by regional changes in
image space, such as downsampling and noise degradation. The second class
degradation type is intimately associated with the spatial position of the
image, such as blurring, and we identify them as spatial-specific dominant
degradations. We introduce a dynamic filter network integrating global and
local branches to address these two degradation types. This network can greatly
alleviate the practical degradation problem. Specifically, the global dynamic
filtering layer can perceive the spatial-agnostic dominant degradation in
different images by applying weights generated by the attention mechanism to
multiple parallel standard convolution kernels, enhancing the network's
representation ability. Meanwhile, the local dynamic filtering layer converts
feature maps of the image into a spatially specific dynamic filtering operator,
which performs spatially specific convolution operations on the image features
to handle spatial-specific dominant degradations. By effectively integrating
both global and local dynamic filtering operators, our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms in both
synthetic and real image datasets.

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like
video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much
computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion
transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the
consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the
temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods
fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are
fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object
motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this
paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex
motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task
of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V
decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V
generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed
shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on
DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error
illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V
compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the
first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), a biologically inspired neural network
infrastructure, has garnered significant attention recently. SNNs utilize
binary spike activations for efficient information transmission, replacing
multiplications with additions, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. However,
binary spike activation maps often fail to capture sufficient data information,
resulting in reduced accuracy. To address this challenge, we advocate reversing
the bit of the weight and activation for SNNs, called \textbf{ReverB-SNN},
inspired by recent findings that highlight greater accuracy degradation from
quantizing activations compared to weights. Specifically, our method employs
real-valued spike activations alongside binary weights in SNNs. This preserves
the event-driven and multiplication-free advantages of standard SNNs while
enhancing the information capacity of activations. Additionally, we introduce a
trainable factor within binary weights to adaptively learn suitable weight
amplitudes during training, thereby increasing network capacity. To maintain
efficiency akin to vanilla \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, our trainable binary weight
SNNs are converted back to standard form using a re-parameterization technique
during inference. Extensive experiments across various network architectures
and datasets, both static and dynamic, demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a
common dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system
architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a
larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system
designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either
directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved
from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle
to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key
insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous
time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large
models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we
introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system
designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current
frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame
features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate
these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes
action-critical image regions. Evaluated on the Bench2Drive CARLA
Leaderboard-v2 benchmark, ETA advances state-of-the-art performance by 8% with
a driving score of 69.53 while maintaining a near-real-time inference speed at

Abstract: Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area
because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in
fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with
low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this
research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose
the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power
monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will
generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared
with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue,
inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose
a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature
representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated
filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the
speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can
maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection
performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection,
the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2,
Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by
AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the
results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to
the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by
72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only
4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3
times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.

raw materials for designers, efficiently extracting high-quality, standardized
assets remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce AssetDropper, the
first framework designed to extract assets from reference images, providing
artists with an open-world asset palette. Our model adeptly extracts a front
view of selected subjects from input images, effectively handling complex
scenarios such as perspective distortion and subject occlusion. We establish a
synthetic dataset of more than 200,000 image-subject pairs and a real-world
benchmark with thousands more for evaluation, facilitating the exploration of
future research in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to ensure precise asset
extraction that aligns well with the image prompts, we employ a pre-trained
reward model to fulfill a closed-loop with feedback. We design the reward model
to perform an inverse task that pastes the extracted assets back into the
reference sources, which assists training with additional consistency and
mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments show that, with the aid of
reward-driven optimization, AssetDropper achieves the state-of-the-art results

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic
diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition

ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects
from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery.
However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on
subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often
suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these
challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a
professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises
1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style
annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We
propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models
and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced
computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms,
ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise
classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language
outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show
that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition,
with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification
accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The
proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses
and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of
architectural culture.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a crucial subfield of computer vision, serving as

animated synthetic datasets for training. This introduces domain gaps when
applied to real-world applications and limits the benefits of scaling up
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Flow-Anything}, a
large-scale data generation framework designed to learn optical flow estimation
from any single-view images in the real world. We employ two effective steps to
make data scaling-up promising. First, we convert a single-view image into a 3D
representation using advanced monocular depth estimation networks. This allows
us to render optical flow and novel view images under a virtual camera. Second,
we develop an Object-Independent Volume Rendering module and a Depth-Aware
Inpainting module to model the dynamic objects in the 3D representation. These
two steps allow us to generate realistic datasets for training from large-scale
single-view images, namely \textbf{FA-Flow Dataset}. For the first time, we
demonstrate the benefits of generating optical flow training data from
large-scale real-world images, outperforming the most advanced unsupervised
methods and supervised methods on synthetic datasets. Moreover, our models
serve as a foundation model and enhance the performance of various downstream
video tasks.

Abstract: How can we generate an image B' that satisfies A:A'::B:B', given the input
images A,A' and B? Recent works have tackled this challenge through approaches
like visual in-context learning or visual instruction. However, these methods
are typically limited to specific models (e.g. InstructPix2Pix. Inpainting
models) rather than general diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion, SDXL).
This dependency may lead to inherited biases or lower editing capabilities. In
this paper, we propose Difference Inversion, a method that isolates only the
difference from A and A' and applies it to B to generate a plausible B'. To
address model dependency, it is crucial to structure prompts in the form of a
"Full Prompt" suitable for input to stable diffusion models, rather than using
an "Instruction Prompt". To this end, we accurately extract the Difference
between A and A' and combine it with the prompt of B, enabling a plug-and-play
application of the difference. To extract a precise difference, we first
identify it through 1) Delta Interpolation. Additionally, to ensure accurate
training, we propose the 2) Token Consistency Loss and 3) Zero Initialization
of Token Embeddings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Difference
Inversion outperforms existing baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively,
indicating its ability to generate more feasible B' in a model-agnostic manner.

Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has
fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities.
However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from
generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual
reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a
step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and
execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with
execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the
task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to
generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning
task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the
composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence
reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we
improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving
logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM
hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and
correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to
launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve
the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with
four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent
achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual
reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM
based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the
novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer,
Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visible images offer rich texture details, while infrared images emphasize
salient targets. Fusing these complementary modalities enhances scene
understanding, particularly for advanced vision tasks under challenging
conditions. Recently, deep learning-based fusion methods have gained attention,
but current evaluations primarily rely on general-purpose metrics without
standardized benchmarks or downstream task performance. Additionally, the lack
of well-developed dual-spectrum datasets and fair algorithm comparisons hinders
progress.
  To address these gaps, we construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset
captured in campus environments, comprising 1,369 well-aligned visible-infrared
image pairs across four representative scenarios: daytime, nighttime, smoke
occlusion, and underpasses. We also propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation
framework that integrates fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection
performance using the lang-segment-anything model to ensure fairness in
downstream evaluation.
  Extensive experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms
under this framework. Results demonstrate that fusion models optimized for
downstream tasks achieve superior performance in target detection, especially
in low-light and occluded scenes. Notably, some algorithms that perform well on
general metrics do not translate to strong downstream performance, highlighting
limitations of current evaluation practices and validating the necessity of our
proposed framework.
  The main contributions of this work are: (1)a campus-oriented dual-spectrum
dataset with diverse and challenging scenes; (2) a task-aware, comprehensive
evaluation framework; and (3) thorough comparative analysis of leading fusion
methods across multiple datasets, offering insights for future development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly improved performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning
examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these
issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS,
which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge
base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a
self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with
intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with
Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This
ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better
and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets,
significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods.
It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in
improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.

*Eduard Allakhverdov,Dmitrii Tarasov,Elizaveta Goncharova,Andrey Kuznetsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to interpret vision features through image reconstruction, showing that image-trained encoders preserve more image information and that orthogonal rotations affect color encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how vision encoders represent features internally is crucial for improving their performance and applicability in various tasks.

Method: Proposed a novel approach for interpreting vision features via image reconstruction, compared two model families (SigLIP and SigLIP2) based on their training objectives, and applied the method to various vision encoders.

Result: Encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain more image information compared to those trained on non-image tasks like contrastive learning. Feature space manipulation leads to predictable image changes, indicating orthogonal rotations control color encoding.

Conclusion: The proposed method can be applied to any vision encoder, providing insights into their internal feature representations and highlighting the importance of training objectives on information retention.

Abstract: Vision encoders are increasingly used in modern applications, from
vision-only models to multimodal systems such as vision-language models.
Despite their remarkable success, it remains unclear how these architectures
represent features internally. Here, we propose a novel approach for
interpreting vision features via image reconstruction. We compare two related
model families, SigLIP and SigLIP2, which differ only in their training
objective, and show that encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain
significantly more image information than those trained on non-image tasks such
as contrastive learning. We further apply our method to a range of vision
encoders, ranking them by the informativeness of their feature representations.
Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the feature space yields predictable
changes in reconstructed images, revealing that orthogonal rotations (rather
than spatial transformations) control color encoding. Our approach can be
applied to any vision encoder, shedding light on the inner structure of its
feature space. The code and model weights to reproduce the experiments are
available in GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the texture realism and reconstruction fidelity in codebook-based real image super-resolution methods, which are limited by inaccurate feature matching and poor texture detail reconstruction.

Method: The method involves three key components: an uncertainty learning mechanism to focus on texture-rich regions, a Top-k feature matching strategy to enhance accuracy through multiple candidate feature fusion, and an Align-Attention module to improve alignment between LR and HR features.

Result: The experimental results show significant improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed UGTSR framework effectively addresses the challenges in codebook-based SR, leading to better performance in real-world applications, and the code will be released upon formal publication.

Abstract: Recent advancements in codebook-based real image super-resolution (SR) have
shown promising results in real-world applications. The core idea involves
matching high-quality image features from a codebook based on low-resolution
(LR) image features. However, existing methods face two major challenges:
inaccurate feature matching with the codebook and poor texture detail
reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided
and Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key
components: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to
focus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that
enhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and
(3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information
between LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to
existing methods. We will release the code upon formal publication.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions
based on the given video, with prior work primarily focusing on identifying the
duration of relevant segments, referred to as explicit visual evidence.
However, explicit visual evidence is not always directly available,
particularly when questions target symbolic meanings or deeper intentions,
leading to significant performance degradation. To fill this gap, we introduce
a novel task and dataset, $\textbf{I}$mplicit $\textbf{V}$ideo
$\textbf{Q}$uestion $\textbf{A}$nswering (I-VQA), which focuses on answering
questions in scenarios where explicit visual evidence is inaccessible. Given an
implicit question and its corresponding video, I-VQA requires answering based
on the contextual visual cues present within the video. To tackle I-VQA, we
propose a novel reasoning framework, IRM (Implicit Reasoning Model),
incorporating dual-stream modeling of contextual actions and intent clues as
implicit reasoning chains. IRM comprises the Action-Intent Module (AIM) and the
Visual Enhancement Module (VEM). AIM deduces and preserves question-related
dual clues by generating clue candidates and performing relation deduction. VEM
enhances contextual visual representation by leveraging key contextual clues.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our IRM in I-VQA tasks,
outperforming GPT-4o, OpenAI-o3, and fine-tuned VideoChat2 by $0.76\%$,
$1.37\%$, and $4.87\%$, respectively. Additionally, IRM performs SOTA on
similar implicit advertisement understanding and future prediction in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasArbi is a new self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution that breaks down scaling into sequential steps and improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution is more flexible than fixed-scale methods, but existing approaches struggle with learning across a wide range of scaling factors. The paper aims to address this challenge.

Method: CasArbi uses a self-cascaded diffusion framework that decomposes arbitrary scaling into smaller sequential factors. It employs a coordinate-guided residual diffusion model to learn continuous image representations and enable efficient sampling.

Result: CasArbi achieves better perceptual and distortion performance than previous methods on various arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that CasArbi effectively meets varying scaling demands through progressive enhancement and seamless transitions, offering a promising approach for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution aims to upsample images to any desired
resolution, offering greater flexibility than traditional fixed-scale
super-resolution. Recent approaches in this domain utilize regression-based or
generative models, but many of them are a single-stage upsampling process,
which may be challenging to learn across a wide, continuous distribution of
scaling factors. Progressive upsampling strategies have shown promise in
mitigating this issue, yet their integration with diffusion models for flexible
upscaling remains underexplored. Here, we present CasArbi, a novel
self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution.
CasArbi meets the varying scaling demands by breaking them down into smaller
sequential factors and progressively enhancing the image resolution at each
step with seamless transitions for arbitrary scales. Our novel
coordinate-guided residual diffusion model allows for the learning of
continuous image representations while enabling efficient diffusion sampling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CasArbi outperforms prior arts in
both perceptual and distortion performance metrics across diverse
arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Natural images are often degraded by complex, composite degradations such as
rain, snow, and haze, which adversely impact downstream vision applications.
While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they
are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across
dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between
preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these
challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image
restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the
model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a
CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with
CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal
feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various
degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies
and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that
integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range
modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative
optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,
preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we
introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances
global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention
to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient
and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image
restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual
quality and quantitative performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and
safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential.
Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to
scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast,
neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a
scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world
driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and
reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result
in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper
introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome
these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into
existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and
consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel
dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an
image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into
neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic
integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2
significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like
text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing
for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable
and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent work on diffusion models proposed that they operate in two regimes:
memorization, in which models reproduce their training data, and
generalization, in which they generate novel samples. While this has been
tested in high-noise settings, the behavior of diffusion models as effective
denoisers when the corruption level is small remains unclear. To address this
gap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under
low-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and
interpretability. Using (i) CelebA subsets of varying sample sizes and (ii)
analytic Gaussian mixture benchmarks, we reveal that models trained on disjoint
data diverge near the data manifold even when their high-noise outputs
converge. We quantify how training set size, data geometry, and model objective
choice shape denoising trajectories and affect score accuracy, providing
insights into how these models actually learn representations of data
distributions. This work starts to address gaps in our understanding of
generative model reliability in practical applications where small
perturbations are common.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery
is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning
but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods
either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via
patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they
suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during
training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR
images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The
high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the
low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches
capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module
integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency
Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and
Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to
stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net
achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39,
respectively. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack

consistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a
multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and
identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between
subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion
module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise
grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we
propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured
bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an
attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused
identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift.
Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based
grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to
produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject
distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in
identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the
scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations
is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets
requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach
consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that
combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection
capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a
multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains
consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent
detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require
frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives,
our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while
ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves
comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation
time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse
datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments,
making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work
establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a
pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset
bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.

Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point

formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a
simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and
possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we
introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point
features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by
grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency
domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a
segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor
datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by
large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D
semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global
patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the
absence of human labels during training.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system
for table tennis using event cameras. Unlike standard cameras, which suffer
from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide
higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater
robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short
time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game
sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized
with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our
system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to
process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach
improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational
latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually
relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected
trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms,
including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based
30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception.
Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the
ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from
an egocentric perspective using event cameras.

Motivation: To address artifacts in VAE training that affect reconstruction and generation quality, without needing major architectural changes.

Conclusion: VIVAT effectively reduces artifacts in KL-VAEs while maintaining their simplicity, providing practical insights for optimization.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer
vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade
reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a
systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without
requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five
prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet
artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward
modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and
the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate
significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across
multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced
by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework
while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for
researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for modeling 3D scenes from multi-view videos either fail to capture complex physical motions at boundaries or need object priors like masks, which limits their applicability. The motivation is to develop a method that can learn physics without these constraints.

Method: FreeGave uses a physics code combined with a divergence-free module to estimate per-Gaussian velocity fields, avoiding traditional PINN losses and object priors.

Result: FreeGave outperforms existing methods in future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation on three public and one real-world dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness without human-labeled data.

Conclusion: FreeGave successfully learns 3D physical motion patterns without object priors or human labels, making it a promising approach for dynamic 3D scene modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the
underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing
PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks,
existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or
require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose
FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any
object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed
by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian
velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging
real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for
future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our
investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn
meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in
training.

Abstract: Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with
standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion
estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications.
In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount.
Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown
remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency.
Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are
computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient
spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better
performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce
Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network
architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive
performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively
capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance
with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar
settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations
compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with
competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark. Our code will be available at

Abstract: With the increasing availability of aerial and satellite imagery, deep
learning presents significant potential for transportation asset management,
safety analysis, and urban planning. This study introduces CrosswalkNet, a
robust and efficient deep learning framework designed to detect various types
of pedestrian crosswalks from 15-cm resolution aerial images. CrosswalkNet
incorporates a novel detection approach that improves upon traditional object
detection strategies by utilizing oriented bounding boxes (OBB), enhancing
detection precision by accurately capturing crosswalks regardless of their
orientation. Several optimization techniques, including Convolutional Block
Attention, a dual-branch Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast module, and cosine
annealing, are implemented to maximize performance and efficiency. A
comprehensive dataset comprising over 23,000 annotated crosswalk instances is
utilized to train and validate the proposed framework. The best-performing
model achieves an impressive precision of 96.5% and a recall of 93.3% on aerial
imagery from Massachusetts, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.
CrosswalkNet has also been successfully applied to datasets from New Hampshire,
Virginia, and Maine without transfer learning or fine-tuning, showcasing its
robustness and strong generalization capability. Additionally, the crosswalk
detection results, processed using High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms
and provided in polygon shapefile format, have been shown to accelerate data
processing and detection, supporting real-time analysis for safety and mobility
applications. This integration offers policymakers, transportation engineers,
and urban planners an effective instrument to enhance pedestrian safety and
improve urban mobility.

Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video,
depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented
reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction. These capabilities enable
systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and
surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal
and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently
heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and
settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or
head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard
supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera
motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video
pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal
foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal
tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from
temporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for
egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across
diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,
egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric
video. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric
video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist
models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source
EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project

Abstract: Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through
intuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful
concepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance
creates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even
illegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored
explicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our
method requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a "safe"
and an "unsafe" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their
per-layer latent differences produces a "refusal vector", which, once
subtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We
introduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference
of embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target
concept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus
preserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the
model's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the
original training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the
model's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust
against adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output
filters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we
can neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity,
graphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks. Project page:

Abstract: Building on the success of text-based reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1,
extending these capabilities to multimodal reasoning holds great promise. While
recent works have attempted to adapt DeepSeek-R1-style reinforcement learning
(RL) training paradigms to multimodal large language models (MLLM), focusing on
domain-specific tasks like math and visual perception, a critical question
remains: How can we achieve the general-purpose visual-language reasoning
through RL? To address this challenge, we make three key efforts: (1) A novel
Scalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline that autonomously generates
context-aware, reasoning-centric question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the
given images. (2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K
multimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse
dataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive
exploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that
combines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL
training efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM
benchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances
performance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks.
Moreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase
data diversity to further improve model performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring the everchanging
landscapes of the Earth. The U-Net architecture has gained popularity for its
capability to capture spatial information and perform pixel-wise
classification. However, their application in the Remote sensing field remains
largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper fill the gap by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of 34 papers. This study conducts a comparison and
analysis of 18 different U-Net variations, assessing their potential for
detecting changes in remote sensing. We evaluate both benefits along with
drawbacks of each variation within the framework of this particular
application. We emphasize variations that are explicitly built for change
detection, such as Siamese Swin-U-Net, which utilizes a Siamese architecture.
The analysis highlights the significance of aspects such as managing data from
different time periods and collecting relationships over a long distance to
enhance the precision of change detection. This study provides valuable
insights for researchers and practitioners that choose U-Net versions for
remote sensing change detection tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context
learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts.
While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies
show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority
voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by
evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a
dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with
more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from
them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline
that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the
answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception-
and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B
and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies
varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our
results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting
that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as
intended in MM-ICL.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires
segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise
visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches
rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and
reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous
spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS
approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate
layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger
reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image
into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and
semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform
explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We
propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT
representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to
enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments
show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS
benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT
representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text,
enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an
LLM.

Motivation: To study historical demographic patterns, migration, urbanization, family movement, and disease spread in preindustrial Finland, there is a need for structured datasets from handwritten archival materials.

Method: Automated data extraction with a deep learning pipeline involving layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting recognition on 200,000 images of migration records.

Result: Over six million structured dataset entries from the migration records, enabling research on migration and demographic studies.

Conclusion: The work shows that automated deep learning can effectively convert handwritten archival data into structured datasets, aiding historical and demographic research.

Abstract: This article presents a large-scale effort to create a structured dataset of
internal migration in Finland between 1800 and 1920 using digitized church
moving records. These records, maintained by Evangelical-Lutheran parishes,
document the migration of individuals and families and offer a valuable source
for studying historical demographic patterns. The dataset includes over six
million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten
migration records.
  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that
included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting
recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a
structured dataset suitable for research.
  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family
migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland. A case study
from the Elim\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be
reconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival
material can be transformed into structured data to support historical and
demographic research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require
integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic
tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the
spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional
level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for
compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial
capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on
these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to
generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+
hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor
scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud
input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs
on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans
by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant
findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the
shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial
capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may struggle with
understanding long or complex videos due to computational demands at test time,
lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, primarily stemming from their
feed-forward processing nature. These limitations could be more severe for
models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as
adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic
resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a
cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a
Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and
collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the
controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate
feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework
enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components.
Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B
by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive
proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0%
improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts.
Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose
benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for
dynamic video understanding. The code is released at

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating
high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model
advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive
evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and
style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge
modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems
requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not
adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we
introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark
framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,
including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated
content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this
benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers
and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of
image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by
allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of
generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only
for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the
corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly
available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model
comparisons within the T2I research community.

Abstract: The CXR-LT series is a community-driven initiative designed to enhance lung
disease classification using chest X-rays (CXR). It tackles challenges in open
long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of
state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve
these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development
and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting
lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT
2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45
disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a
new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the
previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed
classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a
manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization
to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of
CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating
state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare
disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and
zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded
dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical
settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the
insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the
development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activations space is an
important component of mechanistic interpretability. As such, many algorithms
have been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is
often not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce
the best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but
they can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this
paper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a
cost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In
contrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation
matches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation
describes neuron activations across all inputs. To estimate this effectively,
we introduce a novel application of importance sampling to determine which
inputs are the most valuable to show to raters, leading to around 30x cost
reduction compared to uniform sampling. We also analyze the label noise present
in crowd-sourced evaluations and propose a Bayesian method to aggregate
multiple ratings leading to a further ~5x reduction in number of ratings
required for the same accuracy. Finally, we use these methods to conduct a
large-scale study comparing the quality of neuron explanations produced by the
most popular methods for two different vision models.

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress
in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models
like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and
generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of
MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token
imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of
timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address
these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention
(TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal
interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment.
When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image
alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead.
We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating
its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance,
attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the
importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided image editing have achieved notable
success by leveraging natural language prompts for fine-grained semantic
control. However, certain editing semantics are challenging to specify
precisely using textual descriptions alone. A practical alternative involves
learning editing semantics from paired source-target examples. Existing
exemplar-based editing methods still rely on text prompts describing the change
within paired examples or learning implicit text-based editing instructions. In
this paper, we introduce PairEdit, a novel visual editing method designed to
effectively learn complex editing semantics from a limited number of image
pairs or even a single image pair, without using any textual guidance. We
propose a target noise prediction that explicitly models semantic variations
within paired images through a guidance direction term. Moreover, we introduce
a content-preserving noise schedule to facilitate more effective semantic
learning. We also propose optimizing distinct LoRAs to disentangle the learning
of semantic variations from content. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics
while significantly improving content consistency compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects.
However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed
3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating
6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's
appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose
UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online
object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume
access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a
single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model
based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use
image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method
integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between
seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose
estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object
completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving
object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and
HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots
and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are
incomplete or partially captured. Project page:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined
autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their
complementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce
fluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous
latent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids
often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity
between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed
Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing
AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial
blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and
diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through
controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights:
(1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on
high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers
yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under
constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles
for future hybrid generative models.

Abstract: Creating machines capable of understanding the world in 3D is essential in
assisting designers that build and edit 3D environments and robots navigating
and interacting within a three-dimensional space. Inspired by advances in
language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive
models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a
unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a
detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal
training and performance addressing key questions related to data
representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We evaluate performance
across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and
question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We extend
our approach to reconstruct complex 3D object shapes by enriching our 3D
modality with quantized shape encodings, and show our model's effectiveness on
real-world 3D object recognition tasks. Project webpage:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world,
making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable
video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio
into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives
(e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall
short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual
synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this
work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation.
MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks,
enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood,
respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video
generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset
comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is
structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training
for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV
achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning
video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment. Project page:

TL;DR: This paper presents a training-free method for dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos by modifying noise initialization in a pre-trained video diffusion model, using K-order Recursive Noise Representation and Stochastic Latent Modulation to achieve high-fidelity results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos without requiring any weight updates or auxiliary modules, addressing the challenge of deterministic inversion with zero-terminal SNR schedules.

Method: The method involves redesigning the noise initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model. It introduces K-order Recursive Noise Representation for precise alignment between VAE-encoded and DDIM inverted latents, and Stochastic Latent Modulation for visibility-aware sampling to complete occluded regions.

Result: The results show that dynamic view synthesis can be effectively achieved through structured latent manipulation in the noise initialization phase, with high-fidelity outputs and successful completion of occluded regions due to camera motion.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that modifying the noise initialization phase of video diffusion models allows for effective training-free dynamic view synthesis, highlighting the potential of structured latent manipulation for achieving high-quality results without additional training or modules.

Abstract: In this work, we address dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos as an
inverse problem in a training-free setting. By redesigning the noise
initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable
high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary
modules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic
inversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and
resolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order
Recursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this
representation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the
VAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions
resulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which
performs visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded
regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic view synthesis can
be effectively performed through structured latent manipulation in the noise
initialization phase.

Abstract: We introduce ZeroVO, a novel visual odometry (VO) algorithm that achieves
zero-shot generalization across diverse cameras and environments, overcoming
limitations in existing methods that depend on predefined or static camera
calibration setups. Our approach incorporates three main innovations. First, we
design a calibration-free, geometry-aware network structure capable of handling
noise in estimated depth and camera parameters. Second, we introduce a
language-based prior that infuses semantic information to enhance robust
feature extraction and generalization to previously unseen domains. Third, we
develop a flexible, semi-supervised training paradigm that iteratively adapts
to new scenes using unlabeled data, further boosting the models' ability to
generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. We analyze complex autonomous
driving contexts, demonstrating over 30% improvement against prior methods on
three standard benchmarks, KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, as well as a newly
introduced, high-fidelity synthetic dataset derived from Grand Theft Auto
(GTA). By not requiring fine-tuning or camera calibration, our work broadens
the applicability of VO, providing a versatile solution for real-world
deployment at scale.

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic
visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise
controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI
agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the
granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content
output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a
layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level
semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the
simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability,
minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world
distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained
generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the
training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate
that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image
quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance
embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on
visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must
successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares
VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability
to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric
benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform
substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance
performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across
the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2)
brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the
task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies
in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information
easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language
priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of
open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future
investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video
diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where
models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on
their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise
future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions
each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing
autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This
strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that
directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than
relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training
efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic
gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and
performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables
efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second
latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation
quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models. Project

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in
Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy
attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a
sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on
outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading
downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these
outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned
register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to
mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our
discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic
the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We
demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,
enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,
and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register
tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language
models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time
registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time,
offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without
them.

Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature
suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a
novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs
develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing
arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM
via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake,
significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks
like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any
worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of
transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist
models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a
challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new
post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable
and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning
abilities in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive annotation for every task, but recent works have explored training with partial labels. The paper aims to extend this to a zero-shot setting using diffusion models' generalization power.

Method: StableMTL repurposes image generators for latent regression, using a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task conditioning, and a tailored training scheme. It employs a unified latent loss instead of per-task losses and introduces a multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism for efficient cross-task sharing.

Result: StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that StableMTL effectively addresses the challenge of multi-task learning with limited annotations by leveraging diffusion models and a unified latent loss, enabling scalable and synergistic task learning.

Abstract: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive

regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task
conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses
requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling
seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a
multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task
interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task

Abstract: We propose 4DGT, a 4D Gaussian-based Transformer model for dynamic scene

Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components,
enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object
lifespans. We proposed a novel density control strategy in training, which
enables our 4DGT to handle longer space-time input and remain efficient
rendering at runtime. Our model processes 64 consecutive posed frames in a
rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike
optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference,
reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to
long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video
datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in
real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods
on cross-domain videos. Project page: https://4dgt.github.io

Result: A practical and computationally viable method for handling references to hypothetical or non-existent entities.

Conclusion: The paper argues that existing approaches to non-existent entities are either overcommitted to metaphysical assumptions or introduce computational inefficiencies, and proposes a solution using actual type intersections.

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for representing information about entities

actual types rather than specific non existent tokens. The paper positions
itself within the Basic Formal Ontology and its realist commitments,
emphasizing the importance of practical, implementable solutions over purely
metaphysical or philosophical proposals, arguing that existing approaches to
non existent entities either overcommit to metaphysical assumptions or
introduce computational inefficiencies that hinder applications. By developing

library facilitates model evaluation and comparison by offering built-in tools
for training, visualization, and performance assessment. The models are
evaluated using the fetch\_california\_housing dataset, with performance
measured in terms of normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), non-dimensional
error index (NDEI), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Additionally,
computational complexity is analyzed by measuring execution times and rule
evolution during training and testing phases. The results highlight ePL as a
simple yet efficient model that balances accuracy and computational cost,
making it particularly suitable for real-world applications. By making these
models publicly available, evolvingfuzzysystems aims to foster research and
practical applications in adaptive and interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: Roadway safety and mobility remain critical challenges for modern
transportation systems, demanding innovative analytical frameworks capable of
addressing complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. While traditional
engineering methods have made progress, the complexity and dynamism of
real-world traffic necessitate more advanced analytical frameworks. Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their unprecedented capabilities in natural
language understanding, knowledge integration, and reasoning, represent a
promising paradigm shift. This paper comprehensively reviews the application
and customization of LLMs for enhancing roadway safety and mobility. A key
focus is how LLMs are adapted -- via architectural, training, prompting, and
multimodal strategies -- to bridge the "modality gap" with transportation's
unique spatio-temporal and physical data. The review systematically analyzes
diverse LLM applications in mobility (e.g., traffic flow prediction, signal
control) and safety (e.g., crash analysis, driver behavior assessment,).
Enabling technologies such as V2X integration, domain-specific foundation
models, explainability frameworks, and edge computing are also examined.
Despite significant potential, challenges persist regarding inherent LLM
limitations (hallucinations, reasoning deficits), data governance (privacy,
bias), deployment complexities (sim-to-real, latency), and rigorous safety
assurance. Promising future research directions are highlighted, including
advanced multimodal fusion, enhanced spatio-temporal reasoning, human-AI
collaboration, continuous learning, and the development of efficient,
verifiable systems. This review provides a structured roadmap of current
capabilities, limitations, and opportunities, underscoring LLMs' transformative
potential while emphasizing the need for responsible innovation to realize
safer, more intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Several papers have delved into the challenges of human-AI-robot co-learning
and co-adaptation. It has been noted that the terminology used to describe this
collaborative relationship in existing studies needs to be more consistent. For
example, the prefix "co" is used interchangeably to represent both
"collaborative" and "mutual," and the terms "co-learning" and "co-adaptation"
are sometimes used interchangeably. However, they can reflect subtle
differences in the focus of the studies. The current scoping review's primary
research question (RQ1) aims to gather existing papers discussing this
collaboration pattern and examine the terms researchers use to describe this
human-agent relationship. Given the relative newness of this area of study, we
are also keen on exploring the specific types of intelligent agents and task
domains that have been considered in existing research (RQ2). This exploration
is significant as it can shed light on the diversity of human-agent
interactions, from one-time to continuous learning/adaptation scenarios. It can
also help us understand the dynamics of human-agent interactions in different
task domains, guiding our expectations towards research situated in dynamic,
complex domains. Our third objective (RQ3) is to investigate the cognitive
theories and frameworks that have been utilized in existing studies to measure
human-agent co-learning and co-adaptation. This investigation is crucial as it
can help us understand the theoretical underpinnings of human-agent
collaboration and adaptation, and it can also guide us in identifying any new
frameworks proposed specifically for this type of relationship.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a crucial challenge from fixed context
windows and inadequate memory management, leading to a severe shortage of
long-term memory capabilities and limited personalization in the interactive
experience with AI agents. To overcome this challenge, we innovatively propose
a Memory Operating System, i.e., MemoryOS, to achieve comprehensive and
efficient memory management for AI agents. Inspired by the memory management
principles in operating systems, MemoryOS designs a hierarchical storage
architecture and consists of four key modules: Memory Storage, Updating,
Retrieval, and Generation. Specifically, the architecture comprises three
levels of storage units: short-term memory, mid-term memory, and long-term
personal memory. Key operations within MemoryOS include dynamic updates between
storage units: short-term to mid-term updates follow a dialogue-chain-based
FIFO principle, while mid-term to long-term updates use a segmented page
organization strategy. Our pioneering MemoryOS enables hierarchical memory

TL;DR: The paper discusses instrumental convergence and power-seeking in AI, suggesting power is a convergent goal but with limited predictive value without knowing final goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental goal for advanced AI agents.

Method: Abstract decision-theoretic framework analysis.

Result: Power-seeking is a convergent goal but its predictive utility is limited without knowledge of the agent's final goals.

Conclusion: Instrumental convergence is more predictive for agents with high potential for absolute or near-absolute power.

Abstract: Researchers worried about catastrophic risks from advanced AI have argued
that we should expect sufficiently capable AI agents to pursue power over
humanity because power is a convergent instrumental goal, something that is
useful for a wide range of final goals. Others have recently expressed
skepticism of these claims. This paper aims to formalize the concepts of
instrumental convergence and power-seeking in an abstract, decision-theoretic
framework, and to assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental
goal. I conclude that this claim contains at least an element of truth, but
might turn out to have limited predictive utility, since an agent's options
cannot always be ranked in terms of power in the absence of substantive
information about the agent's final goals. However, the fact of instrumental
convergence is more predictive for agents who have a good shot at attaining
absolute or near-absolute power.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) store temporal facts with quadruple formats
(s, p, o, t). Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models perform
link prediction tasks in transductive or semi-inductive settings, which means
the entities, relations, and temporal information in the test graph are fully
or partially observed during training. Such reliance on seen elements during
inference limits the models' ability to transfer to new domains and generalize
to real-world scenarios. A central limitation is the difficulty in learning
representations for entities, relations, and timestamps that are transferable
and not tied to dataset-specific vocabularies. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the first fully-inductive approach to temporal knowledge graph
link prediction. Our model employs sinusoidal positional encodings to capture
fine-grained temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation
representations using message passing conditioned on both local and global
temporal contexts. Our model design is agnostic to temporal granularity and
time span, effectively addressing temporal discrepancies across TKGs and
facilitating time-aware structural information transfer. As a pretrained,
scalable, and transferable model, POSTRA demonstrates strong zero-shot
performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs, effectively generalizing to
novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Extensive theoretical analysis and
empirical results show that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot
performance on various inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, marking a
significant step toward a foundation model for temporal KGs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Enhancing large language models by simply scaling up datasets has begun to
yield diminishing returns, shifting the spotlight to data quality. Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful technique for generating
high-quality chain-of-thought data, yet conventional approaches typically
retain only the top-scoring trajectory from the search tree, discarding sibling
nodes that often contain valuable partial insights, recurrent error patterns,
and alternative reasoning strategies. This unconditional rejection of
non-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in
the whole search tree. We propose SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo
Augmentation), a novel framework that reintegrates these discarded sibling
nodes to refine LLM reasoning. SIGMA forges semantic links among sibling nodes
along each search path and applies a two-stage refinement: a critique model
identifies overlooked strengths and weaknesses across the sibling set, and a
revision model conducts text-based backpropagation to refine the top-scoring
trajectory in light of this comparative feedback. By recovering and amplifying
the underutilized but valuable signals from non-optimal reasoning branches,
SIGMA substantially improves reasoning trajectories. On the challenging MATH
benchmark, our SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy using only 30K
samples, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on 590K samples. This
result highlights that our sibling-guided optimization not only significantly
reduces data usage but also significantly boosts LLM reasoning.

Abstract: There is much interest in using large pre-trained models in Automatic Game
Design (AGD), whether via the generation of code, assets, or more abstract
conceptualization of design ideas. But so far this interest largely stems from
the ad hoc use of such generative models under persistent human supervision.
Much work remains to show how these tools can be integrated into
longer-time-horizon AGD pipelines, in which systems interface with game engines
to test generated content autonomously. To this end, we introduce ScriptDoctor,
a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven system for automatically generating and
testing games in PuzzleScript, an expressive but highly constrained description
language for turn-based puzzle games over 2D gridworlds. ScriptDoctor generates
and tests game design ideas in an iterative loop, where human-authored examples
are used to ground the system's output, compilation errors from the
PuzzleScript engine are used to elicit functional code, and search-based agents
play-test generated games. ScriptDoctor serves as a concrete example of the
potential of automated, open-ended LLM-based workflows in generating novel game
content.

Abstract: Multi-agent artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in
clinical settings, yet the relationship between component-level optimization
and system-wide performance remains poorly understood. We evaluated this
relationship using 2,400 real patient cases from the MIMIC-CDM dataset across
four abdominal pathologies (appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis,
diverticulitis), decomposing clinical diagnosis into information gathering,
interpretation, and differential diagnosis. We evaluated single agent systems
(one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized
models for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes,
process adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while
multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the
component-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and
excellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly
underperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent
system). This finding underscores that successful integration of AI in
healthcare requires not just component level optimization but also attention to
information flow and compatibility between agents. Our findings highlight the
need for end to end system validation rather than relying on component metrics
alone.

Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial
optimization problem with broad real-world applications. Recent advancements in
neural network-based TSP solvers have shown promising results. Nonetheless,
these models often struggle to efficiently solve both small- and large-scale
TSPs using the same set of pre-trained model parameters, limiting their
practical utility. To address this issue, we introduce a novel neural TSP
solver named GELD, built upon our proposed broad global assessment and refined
local selection framework. Specifically, GELD integrates a lightweight
Global-view Encoder (GE) with a heavyweight Local-view Decoder (LD) to enrich
embedding representation while accelerating the decision-making process.
Moreover, GE incorporates a novel low-complexity attention mechanism, allowing
GELD to achieve low inference latency and scalability to larger-scale TSPs.
Additionally, we propose a two-stage training strategy that utilizes training
instances of different sizes to bolster GELD's generalization ability.
Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that GELD outperforms seven state-of-the-art models considering
both solution quality and inference speed. Furthermore, GELD can be employed as
a post-processing method to significantly elevate the quality of the solutions
derived by existing neural TSP solvers via spending affordable additional
computing time. Notably, GELD is shown as capable of solving TSPs with up to
744,710 nodes, first-of-its-kind to solve this large size TSP without relying
on divide-and-conquer strategies to the best of our knowledge.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential
decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any
environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks.
Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past
experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain
these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual
Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient
self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER
accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer.
These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making
patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant
knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments.
We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On
VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena,
CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving
the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a
comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand
it better.

Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between system modeling and AI planning by enabling direct integration of PDDL semantics into SysML models, facilitating automated generation of planning descriptions for engineering design.

Method: The method involves defining reusable stereotypes for PDDL concepts (types, predicates, functions, actions) and using OCL constraints to ensure syntactic consistency, derived from PDDL 3.1's BNF definition to align with SysML practices.

Result: The profile was applied in an aircraft manufacturing case study, modeling a robotic system with interchangeable end effectors to generate PDDL domain and problem descriptions, which were used by a PDDL solver to create optimized execution plans.

Conclusion: The approach offers a reusable bridge between system modeling and AI planning, supporting automated and model-based generation of planning descriptions in engineering design.

Abstract: This paper presents a SysML profile that enables the direct integration of
planning semantics based on the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) into
system models. Reusable stereotypes are defined for key PDDL concepts such as
types, predicates, functions and actions, while formal OCL constraints ensure
syntactic consistency. The profile was derived from the Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
definition of PDDL 3.1 to align with SysML modeling practices. A case study
from aircraft manufacturing demonstrates the application of the profile: a
robotic system with interchangeable end effectors is modeled and enriched to
generate both domain and problem descriptions in PDDL format. These are used as
input to a PDDL solver to derive optimized execution plans. The approach
supports automated and model-based generation of planning descriptions and
provides a reusable bridge between system modeling and AI planning in
engineering design.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often
struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific
contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to
ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To
address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world
modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with
reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of
LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language
hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined
through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the
proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected
using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the
environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based
predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining
hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives
continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to
manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive
accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment
dynamics.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving

mathematical reasoning when answer options are represented as images--an
essential aspect of multi-image comprehension--remains underexplored. To bridge
this gap, we introduce VisioMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical
reasoning in multimodal contexts involving image-based answer choices.
VisioMath comprises 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions, where
each answer option is an image, presenting unique challenges to existing LMMs.
To the best of our knowledge, VisioMath is the first dataset specifically
tailored for mathematical reasoning in image-based-option scenarios, where
fine-grained distinctions between answer choices are critical for accurate
problem-solving. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on VisioMath
and find that even the most advanced models struggle with this task. Notably,
GPT-4o achieves only 45.9% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current
models in reasoning over visually similar answer choices. By addressing a
crucial gap in existing benchmarks, VisioMath establishes a rigorous testbed
for future research, driving advancements in multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to shrink the hypothesis space in ILP using background knowledge to eliminate non-optimal rules, significantly reducing learning times without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of inductive logic programming by reducing the time required for hypothesis space search, which is often computationally intensive.

Method: The approach uses background knowledge to identify and remove rules that are inherently invalid or cannot be part of an optimal hypothesis, implemented via answer set programming to shrink the hypothesis space of a constraint-based ILP system.

Result: Experiments across domains like visual reasoning and game playing show that the method reduces learning times from over 10 hours to 2 seconds with 10 seconds of preprocessing, maintaining predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that shrinking the hypothesis space using background knowledge is an effective way to enhance ILP efficiency, making it feasible for complex domains with large hypothesis spaces.

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. The
goal is to search a hypothesis space for a hypothesis that generalises training
examples and background knowledge. We introduce an approach that 'shrinks' the
hypothesis space before an ILP system searches it. Our approach uses background
knowledge to find rules that cannot be in an optimal hypothesis regardless of
the training examples. For instance, our approach discovers relationships such
as "even numbers cannot be odd" and "prime numbers greater than 2 are odd". It
then removes violating rules from the hypothesis space. We implement our
approach using answer set programming and use it to shrink the hypothesis space
of a constraint-based ILP system. Our experiments on multiple domains,
including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can
substantially reduce learning times whilst maintaining predictive accuracies.
For instance, given just 10 seconds of preprocessing time, our approach can
reduce learning times from over 10 hours to only 2 seconds.

We also propose PsyRoom B for generating personalized treatment plans.
Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AI PsyRoom significantly outperforms

Abstract: Training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is challenging due to their unique

influence of the type of chosen learning algorithm, including bioinspired
learning rules on the accuracy of classification. We proposed a bioinspired
classifier based on the combination of SNN and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC).
This approach synergizes the strengths of SNNs in temporal precision and
biological realism with LZC's structural complexity analysis, facilitating
efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal neural data. It
turned out that the classic backpropagation algorithm achieves excellent
classification accuracy, but at extremely high computational cost, which makes
it impractical for real-time applications. Biologically inspired learning
algorithms such as tempotron and Spikprop provide increased computational
efficiency while maintaining competitive classification performance, making
them suitable for time-sensitive tasks. The results obtained indicate that the
selection of the most appropriate learning algorithm depends on the trade-off
between classification accuracy and computational cost as well as application
constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in high-stakes search-and-rescue (SAR) missions

Max-Information Q-learning), a lightweight dual-critic reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that dynamically adjusts its exploration strategy whenever
mission priorities change. CA-MIQ pairs a standard extrinsic critic for task
reward with an intrinsic critic that fuses state-novelty, information-location
awareness, and real-time priority alignment. A built-in shift detector triggers
transient exploration boosts and selective critic resets, allowing the agent to
re-focus after a priority revision. In a simulated SAR grid-world, where
experiments specifically test adaptation to changes in the priority order of
information types the agent is expected to focus on, CA-MIQ achieves nearly
four times higher mission-success rates than baselines after a single priority
shift and more than three times better performance in multiple-shift scenarios,
achieving 100% recovery while baseline methods fail to adapt. These results
highlight CA-MIQ's effectiveness in any discrete environment with
piecewise-stationary information-value distributions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By
considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know
such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to
formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms
of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality
search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be
formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent)
Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve
cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as
simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large
enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible
from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game
space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the
construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be
used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a
covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the
challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of
Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary
dynamics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on
complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse
information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation
arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load
capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory
(CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in
the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs
have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded
understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework
designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative
problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by
distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing
transactional load via structured communication and a collective working
memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and
fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over
existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis
reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the
emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering
a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a probabilistic safety assurance framework that integrates SafeML with Bayesian Networks to model ML failures in safety-critical systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in an automotive platooning system with traffic sign recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models in safety-critical systems can have reasoning failures due to distributional shifts, which traditional safety methods can't handle effectively.

Method: The framework combines SafeML for detecting distributional shifts with Bayesian Networks to model and analyze ML failures within a causal safety context.

Result: The approach was tested on a simulated automotive platooning system with traffic sign recognition, showing potential benefits in explicitly modelling ML failures for safety assessment.

Conclusion: Integrating SafeML with BNs allows dynamic safety evaluation and system adaptation under uncertainty, suggesting broader applications for safety assurance in ML-based systems.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into safety-critical
systems, such as autonomous vehicle platooning, to enable real-time
decision-making. However, their inherent imperfection introduces a new class of
failure: reasoning failures often triggered by distributional shifts between
operational and training data. Traditional safety assessment methods, which
rely on design artefacts or code, are ill-suited for ML components that learn
behaviour from data. SafeML was recently proposed to dynamically detect such
shifts and assign confidence levels to the reasoning of ML-based components.
Building on this, we introduce a probabilistic safety assurance framework that
integrates SafeML with Bayesian Networks (BNs) to model ML failures as part of
a broader causal safety analysis. This allows for dynamic safety evaluation and
system adaptation under uncertainty. We demonstrate the approach on an
simulated automotive platooning system with traffic sign recognition. The
findings highlight the potential broader benefits of explicitly modelling ML
failures in safety assessment.

Abstract: Deep knowledge analysis tasks always involve the systematic extraction and
association of knowledge from large volumes of data, followed by logical
reasoning to discover insights. However, to solve such complex tasks, existing
deep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematic
organization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, making
it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) They
cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities to
produce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, we
propose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR})
framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability.
Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase to
preprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline.
Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind of
reasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner.
To enhance the abilities of LLMs to solve knowledge analysis tasks in the above
framework, we further introduce \textbf{\KCII}, an LLM that bridges knowledge
organization and reasoning via unified code generation. For knowledge
organization, it generates instantiation code for predefined classes,
transforming data into knowledge objects. For knowledge computation, it
generates analysis code and executes on the above knowledge objects to obtain
deep analysis results. Experimental results on more than thirty datasets across
six knowledge analysis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of \KCII. Moreover,
when integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII can generate high-quality reports
with insightful analytical results compared to the mainstream deep research
framework.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

Abstract: Understanding how events in a scenario causally connect with each other is
important for effectively modeling and reasoning about events. But event
reasoning remains a difficult challenge, and despite recent advances, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately identify causal connections
between events. This struggle leads to poor performance on deeper reasoning
tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To address this
challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g., A
enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality
during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as
well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to
causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on
specific semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of
discussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate
the utility of causal graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications,
and also introduce a new explainable event prediction task that requires a
causal chain of events in the explanation. These explanations are more
informative and coherent than baseline generations. Finally, our overall
approach not finetuned on any downstream task, achieves competitive results
with state-of-the-art models on both forecasting and next event prediction
tasks.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success on a
broad range of tasks, math reasoning remains a challenging one. One of the
approaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs
self-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However,
existing self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone
post-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to
elicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous
self-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose SPOC, a
spontaneous self-correction approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved
solutions and verifications in a single inference pass, with generation
dynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively
scaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by
assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We
adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for
fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification
and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and
verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SPOC significantly improves
performance. Notably, SPOC boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct
models, achieving gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23,

Motivation: The motivation is to automate complex tasks like inverse design of photonic metamaterials, which traditionally require extensive human expertise and iterative processes, using advanced LLM integration for efficiency and innovation.

Method: The method involves developing an Agentic Framework that integrates multiple LLMs, enabling the Agent to propose forward models, use APIs for simulations and optimizations, leverage memory, and apply deep inverse methods to create designs.

Result: The framework successfully automates the inverse design process, showing effectiveness in reasoning, planning, adapting, and generating diverse, potentially novel photonic metamaterial designs.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that the Agentic Framework demonstrates the potential of integrated LLM systems in autonomously handling complex scientific tasks, highlighting its adaptability and capacity for generating innovative solutions in photonic metamaterial design.

Abstract: Recent significant advances in integrating multiple Large Language Model
(LLM) systems have enabled Agentic Frameworks capable of performing complex
tasks autonomously, including novel scientific research. We develop and
demonstrate such a framework specifically for the inverse design of photonic
metamaterials. When queried with a desired optical spectrum, the Agent
autonomously proposes and develops a forward deep learning model, accesses
external tools via APIs for tasks like simulation and optimization, utilizes
memory, and generates a final design via a deep inverse method. The framework's
effectiveness is demonstrated in its ability to automate, reason, plan, and
adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection and
decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs.

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers.
While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks,
their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain
insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established
math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this
evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide
insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate
these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise
manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures.
This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal
reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive
experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain
complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their
reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines
despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard
LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance
regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2)
medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3)
high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that
LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit
algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the
reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and
analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their
strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning
capabilities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the most common model for decision
making under uncertainty in the Machine Learning community. An MDP captures
non-determinism, probabilistic uncertainty, and an explicit model of action. A
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent learns to act in an MDP by maximizing a
utility function. This paper considers the problem of learning a decision
policy that maximizes utility subject to satisfying a constraint expressed in
deontic logic. In this setup, the utility captures the agent's mission - such
as going quickly from A to B. The deontic formula represents (ethical, social,
situational) constraints on how the agent might achieve its mission by
prohibiting classes of behaviors. We use the logic of Expected Act
Utilitarianism, a probabilistic stit logic that can be interpreted over
controlled MDPs. We develop a variation on policy improvement, and show that it
reaches a constrained local maximum of the mission utility. Given that in stit
logic, an agent's duty is derived from value maximization, this can be seen as
a way of acting to simultaneously maximize two value functions, one of which is
implicit, in a bi-level structure. We illustrate these results with experiments
on sample MDPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods perform well on balanced artificial datasets but struggle with real-world imbalanced data, motivating the need for a solution tailored to long-tailed distributions.

Method: The framework includes a self-guided labeling technique with a learnable distribution for pseudo-labels and a representation balancing process that focuses on tail classes through neighborhood mining.

Result: Experiments on public datasets show the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in GCD tasks under long-tailed distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of GCD in imbalanced real-world datasets by reducing bias and enhancing representation learning for tail classes.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) utilizes labeled samples of known
classes to discover novel classes in unlabeled samples. Existing methods show
effective performance on artificial datasets with balanced distributions.
However, real-world datasets are always imbalanced, significantly affecting the
effectiveness of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
framework that performs generalized category discovery in long-tailed
distributions. We first present a self-guided labeling technique that uses a
learnable distribution to generate pseudo-labels, resulting in less biased
classifiers. We then introduce a representation balancing process to derive
discriminative representations. By mining sample neighborhoods, this process
encourages the model to focus more on tail classes. We conduct experiments on
public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The
results show that our model exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents --
particularly as task and agent sophistication increase -- requires more than
simple comparison of reward curves, yet standard methods for behavioral
analysis remain underdeveloped in DRL. We apply tools from neuroscience and
ethology to study DRL agents in a novel, complex, partially observable
environment, ForageWorld, designed to capture key aspects of real-world animal
foraging -- including sparse, depleting resource patches, predator threats, and
spatially extended arenas. We use this environment as a platform for applying
joint behavioral and neural analysis to agents, revealing detailed,
quantitatively grounded insights into agent strategies, memory, and planning.
Contrary to common assumptions, we find that model-free RNN-based DRL agents
can exhibit structured, planning-like behavior purely through emergent dynamics
-- without requiring explicit memory modules or world models. Our results show
that studying DRL agents like animals -- analyzing them with
neuroethology-inspired tools that reveal structure in both behavior and neural
dynamics -- uncovers rich structure in their learning dynamics that would
otherwise remain invisible. We distill these tools into a general analysis
framework linking core behavioral and representational features to diagnostic
methods, which can be reused for a wide range of tasks and agents. As agents
grow more complex and autonomous, bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, and
AI will be essential -- not just for understanding their behavior, but for
ensuring safe alignment and maximizing desirable behaviors that are hard to
measure via reward. We show how this can be done by drawing on lessons from how
biological intelligence is studied.

Abstract: The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of
high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the
increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a
significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be
compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often
rely on high-dimension training data such as text, making them unsuitable for
annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate
the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information
within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate
LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our
approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning
on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on
prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical
guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We
establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically
demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world
crowdsourcing datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models show strong promise for formal

by the need for expert-written formal statements as inputs, limiting their
applicability to real-world problems expressed in natural language. We tackle
this gap with Mathesis, the first end-to-end theorem proving pipeline
processing informal problem statements. It contributes Mathesis-Autoformalizer,
the first autoformalizer using reinforcement learning to enhance the
formalization ability of natural language problems, aided by our novel
LeanScorer framework for nuanced formalization quality assessment. It also
proposes a Mathesis-Prover, which generates formal proofs from the formalized
statements. To evaluate the real-world applicability of end-to-end formal
theorem proving, we introduce Gaokao-Formal, a benchmark of 488 complex
problems from China's national college entrance exam. Our approach is carefully
designed, with a thorough study of each component. Experiments demonstrate
Mathesis's effectiveness, with the autoformalizer outperforming the best
baseline by 22% in pass-rate on Gaokao-Formal. The full system surpasses other

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fact verification systems struggle with complex claims due to static models that can't capture evolving reasoning paths, leading to poor retrieval and interpretability.

Method: The framework has two modules: structure-enhanced retrieval to build reasoning graphs and reasoning-path-guided verification to incrementally create subgraphs for inference. It also includes a structure-aware mechanism for long-range dependencies.

Result: Experiments on FEVER and HoVer datasets show the approach outperforms baselines, improving retrieval precision and verification accuracy.

Conclusion: Reasoning-path modeling is effective for multi-hop fact verification, suggesting that structured graphs enhance system performance.

Abstract: The growing complexity of factual claims in real-world scenarios presents
significant challenges for automated fact verification systems, particularly in
accurately aggregating and reasoning over multi-hop evidence. Existing
approaches often rely on static or shallow models that fail to capture the
evolving structure of reasoning paths, leading to fragmented retrieval and
limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a Structural
Reasoning framework for Multi-hop Fact Verification that explicitly models
reasoning paths as structured graphs throughout both evidence retrieval and
claim verification stages. Our method comprises two key modules: a
structure-enhanced retrieval mechanism that constructs reasoning graphs to
guide evidence collection, and a reasoning-path-guided verification module that
incrementally builds subgraphs to represent evolving inference trajectories. We
further incorporate a structure-aware reasoning mechanism that captures
long-range dependencies across multi-hop evidence chains, enabling more precise
verification. Extensive experiments on the FEVER and HoVer datasets demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the
effectiveness of reasoning-path modeling in enhancing retrieval precision and
verification accuracy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both

influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across
diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is
limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and
semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream
reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven
StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and
Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean.
  In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a
higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for
structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing
spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in
both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of
retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to
support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.

Motivation: To automate the translation of FL algorithms from Python to CSP processes, making verification more efficient and accessible for ML/AI developers and LLMs.

Method: Using ChatGPT to translate Python FL algorithms into CSP processes and estimating minimal context via feedback for verification with PAT.

Result: Successful automated translation and verification of both centralized and decentralized FL algorithms using ChatGPT and PAT.

Conclusion: The proposed translation process effectively automates FL algorithm verification, reducing manual effort and improving accessibility for non-expert users.

Abstract: The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple Python FL
framework that is easy to use by ML&AI developers who do not need to be
professional programmers and is also amenable to LLMs. In the previous
research, generic federated learning algorithms provided by this framework were
manually translated into the CSP processes and algorithms' safety and liveness
properties were automatically verified by the model checker PAT. In this paper,
a simple translation process is introduced wherein the ChatGPT is used to
automate the translation of the mentioned federated learning algorithms in
Python into the corresponding CSP processes. Within the process, the minimality
of the used context is estimated based on the feedback from ChatGPT. The
proposed translation process was experimentally validated by successful
translation (verified by the model checker PAT) of both generic centralized and
decentralized federated learning algorithms.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still

focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides
objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less
studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral
hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the
snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence
Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects
hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive
temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint
embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral
hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while
maintaining descriptive accuracy.

Abstract: This study investigates effective strategies for developing a customised GPT
agent to code classroom dialogue. While classroom dialogue is widely recognised
as a crucial element of education, its analysis remains challenging due to the
need for a nuanced understanding of dialogic functions and the labour-intensive
nature of manual transcript coding. Recent advancements in large language
models offer promising avenues for automating this process. However, existing
studies predominantly focus on training large-scale models or evaluating
pre-trained models with fixed codebooks, which are often not applicable or
replicable for dialogue researchers working with small datasets or customised
coding schemes. Using GPT-4's MyGPT agent as a case, this study evaluates its
baseline performance in coding classroom dialogue with a human codebook and
examines how performance varies with different example inputs through a
variable control method. Through a design-based research approach, it
identifies a set of practical strategies, based on MyGPT's unique features, for
configuring effective agents with limited data. The findings suggest that,
despite some limitations, a MyGPT agent developed with these strategies can
serve as a useful coding assistant by generating coding suggestions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show impressive vision-language
benchmark performance, yet growing concerns about data contamination (test set
exposure during training) risk masking true generalization. This concern
extends to reasoning MLLMs, often fine-tuned via reinforcement learning from
potentially contaminated base models. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework to rigorously assess MLLM generalization, moving beyond static
benchmarks. Instead of perturbing inputs, we perturb the task itself. Using the
same visual input, models are evaluated across a family of tasks (e.g., QA,
captioning, question posing, verification) to probe diverse capabilities. This
task perturbation reveals whether model performance is robust or reliant on
superficial task-specific cues. Our approach is analogous to loss landscape
sharpness: models overfit or contaminated for a single task (sharp minima)
falter under task shifts, unlike models with generalizable solutions (flatter
minima). We developed an automated pipeline with a calibrated judge scoring
open-ended generations (captions, questions) using paraphrase and corruption
sampling. Applying this framework to leading image/video MLLMs on benchmarks
including MME, RealWorldQA, and CVRR-ES, we analyze each model's cross-task
"ability vector." We demonstrate that fine-tuning on simulated test data
(extreme contamination) drastically sharpens task-specific performance but
harms overall generalization. Our dynamic task perturbation offers deeper
insights into MLLM generalization, distinguishing genuine understanding from
spurious leakage or overfitting.

Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended
design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information

autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI)
operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process,
including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific
workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate
BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based
conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design.
The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its
operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to
complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent
effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent,
highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural
modeling scenarios.

(LLMs) has markedly enhanced agent decision making. Consequently, researchers
have begun exploring agent performance in dynamically changing high-risk
scenarios, i.e., fire, flood, and wind scenarios in the HAZARD benchmark. Under
these extreme conditions, the delay in decision making emerges as a crucial yet
insufficiently studied issue. We propose a Time Conversion Mechanism (TCM) that
translates inference delays in decision-making into equivalent simulation
frames, thus aligning cognitive and physical costs under a single FPS-based
metric. By extending HAZARD with Respond Latency (RL) and Latency-to-Action
Ratio (LAR), we deliver a fully latency-aware evaluation protocol. Moreover, we
present the Rapid-Reflex Async-Reflect Agent (RRARA), which couples a
lightweight LLM-guided feedback module with a rule-based agent to enable
immediate reactive behaviors and asynchronous reflective refinements in situ.
Experiments on HAZARD show that RRARA substantially outperforms existing
baselines in latency-sensitive scenarios.

*Jake Tuero,Michael Buro,Levi H. S. Lelis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to learn subgoal-based policies for policy tree search algorithms, improving sample efficiency by utilizing both successful and failed search trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current policy tree search algorithms require complete solution trajectories for training, which can be costly and lead to wasted search samples on hard instances.

Method: The paper introduces a novel approach to learn subgoals and policies conditioned on subgoals from all search trees, including those from failed attempts.

Result: Empirical results show that the proposed method enhances sample efficiency in learning policies and heuristic functions in an online setting.

Conclusion: The method effectively uses search experiences, even from failures, to improve policy learning for policy tree search.

Abstract: Policy tree search is a family of tree search algorithms that use a policy to
guide the search. These algorithms provide guarantees on the number of
expansions required to solve a given problem that are based on the quality of
the policy. While these algorithms have shown promising results, the process in
which they are trained requires complete solution trajectories to train the
policy. Search trajectories are obtained during a trial-and-error search
process. When the training problem instances are hard, learning can be
prohibitively costly, especially when starting from a randomly initialized
policy. As a result, search samples are wasted in failed attempts to solve
these hard instances. This paper introduces a novel method for learning
subgoal-based policies for policy tree search algorithms. The subgoals and
policies conditioned on subgoals are learned from the trees that the search
expands while attempting to solve problems, including the search trees of
failed attempts. We empirically show that our policy formulation and training
method improve the sample efficiency of learning a policy and heuristic
function in this online setting.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable proficiency in numerous
coding-related tasks; however, their capabilities in detecting software
vulnerabilities remain limited. This limitation primarily stems from two
factors: (1) the absence of reasoning data related to vulnerabilities, which
hinders the models' ability to capture underlying vulnerability patterns; and
(2) their focus on learning semantic representations rather than the reason
behind them, thus failing to recognize semantically similar vulnerability
samples. Furthermore, the development of LLMs specialized in vulnerability
detection is challenging, particularly in environments characterized by the
scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
ReVD that excels at mining vulnerability patterns through reasoning data
synthesizing and vulnerability-specific preference optimization. Specifically,
we construct forward and backward reasoning processes for vulnerability and
corresponding fixed code, ensuring the synthesis of high-quality reasoning
data. Moreover, we design the triplet supervised fine-tuning followed by
curriculum online preference optimization for enabling ReVD to better
understand vulnerability patterns. The extensive experiments conducted on
PrimeVul and SVEN datasets demonstrate that ReVD sets new state-of-the-art for
LLM-based software vulnerability detection, e.g., 12.24\%-22.77\% improvement
in the accuracy. The source code and data are available at

Abstract: As the scale and complexity of cloud-based AI systems continue to increase,
the detection and adaptive recovery of system faults have become the core
challenges to ensure service reliability and continuity. In this paper, we
propose an Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) that integrates
Large Language Model (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), aiming to
realize a fault recovery framework with semantic understanding and policy
optimization capabilities in cloud AI systems. On the basis of the traditional
DRL-based control model, the proposed method constructs a two-stage hybrid
architecture: (1) an LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation module, which can
dynamically extract deep contextual semantics from multi-source logs and system
indicators to accurately identify potential fault modes; (2) DRL recovery
strategy optimizer, based on reinforcement learning, learns the dynamic
matching of fault types and response behaviors in the cloud environment. The
innovation of this method lies in the introduction of LLM for environment
modeling and action space abstraction, which greatly improves the exploration
efficiency and generalization ability of reinforcement learning. At the same
time, a memory-guided meta-controller is introduced, combined with
reinforcement learning playback and LLM prompt fine-tuning strategy, to achieve
continuous adaptation to new failure modes and avoid catastrophic forgetting.
Experimental results on the cloud fault injection platform show that compared
with the existing DRL and rule methods, the IFSHM framework shortens the system
recovery time by 37% with unknown fault scenarios.

underexplored. This paper analyzes the development and evaluation of MLLMs for
mathematical problem solving, focusing on diagrams, multilingual text, and
symbolic notation. We then assess several models, including GPT 4o, Pixtral,
Qwen VL, Llama 3.2 Vision variants, and Gemini 2.0 Flash in a multilingual
Kangaroo style benchmark spanning English, French, Spanish, and Catalan. Our
experiments reveal four key findings. First, overall precision remains moderate
across geometry, visual algebra, logic, patterns, and combinatorics: no single
model excels in every topic. Second, while most models see improved accuracy
with questions that do not have images, the gain is often limited; performance
for some remains nearly unchanged without visual input, indicating
underutilization of diagrammatic information. Third, substantial variation
exists across languages and difficulty levels: models frequently handle easier
items but struggle with advanced geometry and combinatorial reasoning. Notably,
Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves the highest precision on image based tasks, followed
by Qwen VL 2.5 72B and GPT 4o, though none approach human level performance.
Fourth, a complementary analysis aimed at distinguishing whether models reason
or simply recite reveals that Gemini and GPT 4o stand out for their structured
reasoning and consistent accuracy. In contrast, Pixtral and Llama exhibit less
consistent reasoning, often defaulting to heuristics or randomness when unable
to align their outputs with the given answer options.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are vulnerable, highlighting the
need for tailored attacks to assess their robustness and ensure security.
However, existing HGNN attacks often require complex retraining of parameters
to generate specific perturbations for new scenarios. Recently, foundation
models have opened new horizons for the generalization of graph neural networks
by capturing shared semantics across various graph distributions. This leads us
to ask:Can we design a foundation attack model for HGNNs that enables
generalizable perturbations across different HGNNs, and quickly adapts to new
heterogeneous graphs (HGs)? Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant
differences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly
share common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective.
Therefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining
shared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise
heterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation
surrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared
relation-aware attack units. Building on this, we implement a serialized
relation-by-relation attack based on the identified relational weights. In this
way, the perturbation can be transferred to various target HGNNs and easily
fine-tuned for new HGs. Extensive experiments exhibit powerful attack
performances and generalizability of our method.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) aims to function as a judge by making final
rulings based on case claims and facts, which plays a vital role in the
judicial domain for supporting court decision-making and improving judicial
efficiency. However, existing methods often struggle with logical errors when
conducting complex legal reasoning. We propose LegalReasoner, which enhances
LJP reliability through step-wise verification and correction of the reasoning
process. Specifically, it first identifies dispute points to decompose complex
cases, and then conducts step-wise reasoning while employing a process verifier
to validate each step's logic from correctness, progressiveness, and potential
perspectives. When errors are detected, expert-designed attribution and
resolution strategies are applied for correction. To fine-tune LegalReasoner,
we release the LegalHK dataset, containing 58,130 Hong Kong court cases with
detailed annotations of dispute points, step-by-step reasoning chains, and
process verification labels. Experiments demonstrate that LegalReasoner
significantly improves concordance with court decisions from 72.37 to 80.27 on
LLAMA-3.1-70B. The data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fact verification methods have limitations in handling complex claims that require multi-hop reasoning over fragmented evidence, leading to reasoning errors, noisy evidence, and poor adaptability.

Method: AFEV is a novel framework that iteratively decomposes complex claims into atomic facts, dynamically refines claim understanding, reranks evidence to filter noise, and uses context-specific demonstrations for reasoning.

Result: AFEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and interpretability on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The iterative decomposition and adaptive reasoning approach of AFEV enhances fact verification by reducing errors and improving evidence retrieval, making it more effective for complex claims.

Abstract: Fact verification plays a vital role in combating misinformation by assessing
the veracity of claims through evidence retrieval and reasoning. However,
traditional methods struggle with complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning
over fragmented evidence, as they often rely on static decomposition strategies
and surface-level semantic retrieval, which fail to capture the nuanced
structure and intent of the claim. This results in accumulated reasoning
errors, noisy evidence contamination, and limited adaptability to diverse
claims, ultimately undermining verification accuracy in complex scenarios. To
address this, we propose Atomic Fact Extraction and Verification (AFEV), a
novel framework that iteratively decomposes complex claims into atomic facts,
enabling fine-grained retrieval and adaptive reasoning. AFEV dynamically
refines claim understanding and reduces error propagation through iterative
fact extraction, reranks evidence to filter noise, and leverages
context-specific demonstrations to guide the reasoning process. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that AFEV achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in the training process for Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC)
agents is the generation of partner agents that are diverse in collaborative
conventions. Current Cross-play Minimization (XPM) methods for population
generation can be very computationally expensive and sample inefficient as the
training objective requires sampling multiple types of trajectories. Each
partner agent in the population is also trained from scratch, despite all of
the partners in the population learning policies of the same coordination task.
In this work, we propose that simulated trajectories from the dynamics model of
an environment can drastically speed up the training process for XPM methods.
We introduce XPM-WM, a framework for generating simulated trajectories for XPM
via a learned World Model (WM). We show XPM with simulated trajectories removes
the need to sample multiple trajectories. In addition, we show our proposed
method can effectively generate partners with diverse conventions that match
the performance of previous methods in terms of SP population training reward
as well as training partners for ZSC agents. Our method is thus, significantly
more sample efficient and scalable to a larger number of partners.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning have shown that
sophisticated behaviors such as planning and self-reflection can emerge through
reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite these successes, RL in its
current form remains insufficient to induce capabilities that exceed the
limitations of the base model, as it is primarily optimized based on existing
knowledge of the model rather than facilitating the acquisition of new
information. To address this limitation, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
to learn what RL cannot, which enables the incorporation of new knowledge and
reasoning patterns by leveraging high-quality demonstration data. We analyze
the training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning and find that RL excels
at maintaining and improving performance on questions within the model's
original capabilities, while SFT is more effective at enabling progress on
questions beyond the current scope of the model. Motivated by the complementary
strengths of RL and SFT, we introduce a novel training approach,
\textbf{ReLIFT} (\textbf{Re}inforcement \textbf{L}earning \textbf{I}nterleaved
with Online \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning). In ReLIFT, the model is primarily
trained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality
solutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates
between RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT
achieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five
competition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to
other zero-RL models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReLIFT outperforms both
RL and SFT while using only 13\% of the detailed demonstration data,
highlighting its scalability. These results provide compelling evidence that
ReLIFT overcomes the fundamental limitations of RL and underscores the
significant potential.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HARIS, a method for multi-hop claim verification that combines reasoning and search agents to improve accuracy and interpretability through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hop claim verification is challenging due to the need for multi-step reasoning and iterative information search to find hidden bridging facts, with reasoning and search being inherently interleaved.

Method: HARIS uses a high-level reasoning agent to build verification chains and generate factual questions, and a low-level search agent to retrieve information and refine searches based on findings, trained with reinforcement learning.

Result: HARIS shows strong performance on EX-FEVER and HOVER benchmarks, significantly advancing multi-hop claim verification.

Conclusion: HARIS effectively models the coordinated process of reasoning and search, enhancing accuracy and interpretability in multi-hop claim verification tasks.

Abstract: Multi-hop claim verification is inherently challenging, requiring multi-step
reasoning to construct verification chains while iteratively searching for
information to uncover hidden bridging facts. This process is fundamentally
interleaved, as effective reasoning relies on dynamically retrieved evidence,
while effective search demands reasoning to refine queries based on partial
information. To achieve this, we propose Hierarchical Agent Reasoning and
Information Search (HARIS), explicitly modeling the coordinated process of
reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning. HARIS consists of a
high-level reasoning agent that focuses on constructing the main verification
chain, generating factual questions when more information is needed, and a
low-level search agent that iteratively retrieves more information, refining
its search based on intermediate findings. This design allows each agent to
specialize in its respective task, enhancing verification accuracy and
interpretability. HARIS is trained using reinforcement learning with
outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on the EX-FEVER and HOVER
benchmarks demonstrate that HARIS achieves strong performance, greatly
advancing multi-hop claim verification.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved strong performance in
cooperative adversarial tasks. However, most existing methods typically train
agents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static
difficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments
and often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum
learning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL
that employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism. This mechanism
continuously modulates opponent strength based on real-time agent training
performance, allowing agents to progressively learn from easier to more
challenging scenarios. However, the dynamic nature of CL introduces instability
due to nonstationary environments and sparse global rewards. To address this
challenge, we develop a Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage (CGRPA),
which is tightly coupled with the curriculum by providing intrinsic credit
signals that reflect each agent's impact under evolving task demands. CGRPA
constructs a counterfactual advantage function that isolates individual
contributions within group behavior, facilitating more reliable policy updates
throughout the curriculum. CGRPA evaluates each agent's contribution through
constructing counterfactual action advantage function, providing intrinsic
rewards that enhance credit assignment and stabilize learning under
non-stationary conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
improves both training stability and final performance, achieving competitive
results against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing
chemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable
formats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in
this task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex
molecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) the \textit{Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought}
mechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular
graphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric
principle of \textit{Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen}, which addresses
the mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded
annotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a
large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,
and introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained
evaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist
models, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in
scenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,
GTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage
points, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work
will drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby
advancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release
GTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and
multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent
frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information
flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce
SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based
agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC),
precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data
exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM
reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or
adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure
robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces
transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared
state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce
mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that
further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To
validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and
concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security
guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming
state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for
principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of
reliable autonomy.

Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for

Abstract: (M)LLM-powered computer use agents (CUA) are emerging as a transformative
technique to automate human-computer interaction. However, existing CUA
benchmarks predominantly target GUI agents, whose evaluation methods are
susceptible to UI changes and ignore function interactions exposed by
application APIs, e.g., Model Context Protocol (MCP). To this end, we propose
MCPWorld, the first automatic CUA testbed for API, GUI, and API-GUI hybrid
agents. A key principle of MCPWorld is the use of "white-box apps", i.e., those
with source code availability and can be revised/re-compiled as needed (e.g.,
adding MCP support), with two notable advantages:
  (1) It greatly broadens the design space of CUA, such as what and how the app
features to be exposed/extracted as CUA-callable APIs.
  (2) It allows MCPWorld to programmatically verify task completion by directly
monitoring application behavior through techniques like dynamic code
instrumentation, offering robust, accurate CUA evaluation decoupled from
specific agent implementations or UI states.
  Currently, MCPWorld includes 201 well curated and annotated user tasks,
covering diversified use cases and difficulty levels. MCPWorld is also fully
containerized with GPU acceleration support for flexible adoption on different
OS/hardware environments. Our preliminary experiments, using a representative
LLM-powered CUA framework, achieve 75.12% task completion accuracy,
simultaneously providing initial evidence on the practical effectiveness of
agent automation leveraging MCP. Overall, we anticipate MCPWorld to facilitate
and standardize the benchmarking of next-generation computer use agents that
can leverage rich external tools. Our code and dataset are publicly available

the early training stages of small models, where benchmarks often fail to
provide meaningful or discriminative signals. To explore how these differences
arise, this competition tackles the challenge of designing scientific knowledge
evaluation tasks specifically tailored for measuring early training progress of
language models. Participants are invited to develop novel evaluation
methodologies or adapt existing benchmarks to better capture performance
differences among language models. To support this effort, we provide three
pre-trained small models (0.5B, 1B, and 3B parameters), along with intermediate
checkpoints sampled during training up to 200B tokens. All experiments and
development work can be run on widely available free cloud-based GPU platforms,
making participation accessible to researchers with limited computational
resources. Submissions will be evaluated based on three criteria: the quality
of the performance signal they produce, the consistency of model rankings at 1
trillion tokens of training, and their relevance to the scientific knowledge
domain. By promoting the design of tailored evaluation strategies for early
training, this competition aims to attract a broad range of participants from
various disciplines, including those who may not be machine learning experts or
have access to dedicated GPU resources. Ultimately, this initiative seeks to
make foundational LLM research more systematic and benchmark-informed from the
earliest phases of model development.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite
deliberate safety alignment efforts, posing significant risks to users and
society. To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content,
system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM
inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a
prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models
rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with
out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak
attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive
reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide
robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates
in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input
content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced
alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with
accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to
internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over
unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe
accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored
to specific safety requirements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the Semantic Spacetime graph model, focusing on its formal aspects for directed knowledge representations and process modeling. It introduces a finite $\\.gamma(3,4)$ representation that allows for scalable semantic operations and addresses issues with absorbing states causing information leakage, linking it to the problem of division by zero and the need for manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a formal framework for Semantic Spacetime that ensures predictability and scalability in knowledge representation and process modeling, while addressing challenges related to information leakage in graph processes.

Method: The paper presents formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model, defines a finite $\\.gamma(3,4)$ representation, and explores the implications of absorbing states and division by zero in graph operations.

Result: The Semantic Spacetime model with its $\\.gamma(3,4)$ representation offers a closed set of operations for scalable semantic complexity. Absorbing states in graphs lead to information leakage, which is connected to division by zero issues requiring manual remediation.

Conclusion: The Semantic Spacetime model and Promise Theory help clarify the relationship between absorbing states, boundary information, and intentionality, highlighting the need for addressing information leakage through manual injection when closure is lost.

Abstract: Some formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model are presented, with
reference to its use for directed knowledge representations and process
modelling. A finite $\gamma(3,4)$ representation is defined to form a closed
set of operations that can scale to any degree of semantic complexity. The
Semantic Spacetime postulates bring predictability with minimal constraints to
pathways in graphs. The ubiquitous appearance of absorbing states in any
partial graph means that a graph process leaks information. The issue is
closely associated with the issue of division by zero, which signals a loss of
closure and the need for manual injection of remedial information. The Semantic
Spacetime model (and its Promise Theory) origins help to clarify how such
absorbing states are associated with boundary information where intentionality
can enter.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is fundamental in complex decision-making tasks.
Traditional algorithms, while effective, often demand extensive
problem-specific modeling and struggle to adapt to nonlinear structures. Recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enhanced explainability,
adaptability, and reasoning. This work proposes Reflective Evolution of
Multi-objective Heuristics (REMoH), a novel framework integrating NSGA-II with
LLM-based heuristic generation. A key innovation is a reflection mechanism that
uses clustering and search-space reflection to guide the creation of diverse,
high-quality heuristics, improving convergence and maintaining solution
diversity. The approach is evaluated on the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling
Problem (FJSSP) in-depth benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods using
three instance datasets: Dauzere, Barnes, and Brandimarte. Results demonstrate
that REMoH achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches
with reduced modeling effort and enhanced adaptability. These findings
underscore the potential of LLMs to augment traditional optimization, offering
greater flexibility, interpretability, and robustness in multi-objective
scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified approach to integrating metacognition into the Common Model of Cognition (CMC) by utilizing explicit representations of cognitive capabilities in working memory, with minimal structural changes to the CMC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the CMC by incorporating metacognition, allowing agents to reason about their own cognitive processes and capabilities, thereby enabling more human-like mental functions.

Method: The method involves extending the CMC to include explicit representations of an agent's cognitive processes and capabilities within working memory, enabling reasoning about these aspects without major structural changes.

Result: The result demonstrates that integrating metacognition into CMC through explicit representations in working memory is feasible, with examples showing how this can be implemented in practice.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that this approach effectively enhances the CMC with metacognitive abilities, leveraging existing structures to achieve human-like cognitive functions with minimal modifications.

Abstract: The Common Model of Cognition (CMC) provides an abstract characterization of
the structure and processing required by a cognitive architecture for
human-like minds. We propose a unified approach to integrating metacognition
within the CMC. We propose that metacognition involves reasoning over explicit
representations of an agent's cognitive capabilities and processes in working
memory. Our proposal exploits the existing cognitive capabilities of the CMC,
making minimal extensions in the structure and information available within
working memory. We provide examples of metacognition within our proposal.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Human reasoning is flexible, adaptive, and grounded in prior
experience-qualities that large language models (LLMs) still struggle to
emulate. Existing methods either explore diverse reasoning paths at inference
time or search for optimal workflows through expensive operations, but both
fall short in leveraging multiple reusable strategies in a structured,
efficient manner. We propose Guideline Forest, a framework that enhances LLMs
reasoning by inducing structured reasoning strategies-called guidelines-from
verified examples and executing them via step-wise aggregation. Unlike
test-time search or single-path distillation, our method draws on verified
reasoning experiences by inducing reusable guidelines and expanding each into
diverse variants. Much like human reasoning, these variants reflect alternative
thought patterns, are executed in parallel, refined via self-correction, and
aggregated step by step-enabling the model to adaptively resolve uncertainty
and synthesize robust solutions.We evaluate Guideline Forest on four
benchmarks-GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval-spanning mathematical and
programmatic reasoning. Guideline Forest consistently outperforms strong
baselines, including CoT, ReAct, ToT, FoT, and AFlow. Ablation studies further
highlight the effectiveness of multi-path reasoning and stepwise aggregation,
underscoring the Guideline Forest's adaptability and generalization potential.

TL;DR: This paper explores how LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct performs multi-digit addition by analyzing its internal computational processes using linear probing and logit-lens inspection, revealing a four-stage trajectory that suggests a hierarchical computation over memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the internal arithmetic processes of large language models, particularly LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, to determine whether they perform computation or rely on memorization.

Method: The method involves combining linear probing with logit-lens inspection to analyze the model's forward pass during multi-digit addition tasks.

Result: The study found a four-stage trajectory in the model's processing: initial decodability of formula-structure representations, emergence of core computational features, clearer numerical abstractions in deeper layers, and reliable top-rank correct answer token near the output.

Conclusion: The trajectory indicates a hierarchical computational process in the model, emphasizing internal computation rather than rote memorization, and the authors release their code and data for reproducibility.

Abstract: Multi-digit addition is a clear probe of the computational power of large
language models. To dissect the internal arithmetic processes in
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, we combine linear probing with logit-lens inspection.
Inspired by the step-by-step manner in which humans perform addition, we
propose and analyze a coherent four-stage trajectory in the forward
pass:Formula-structure representations become linearly decodable first, while
the answer token is still far down the candidate list.Core computational
features then emerge prominently.At deeper activation layers, numerical
abstractions of the result become clearer, enabling near-perfect detection and
decoding of the individual digits in the sum.Near the output, the model
organizes and generates the final content, with the correct token reliably
occupying the top rank.This trajectory suggests a hierarchical process that
favors internal computation over rote memorization. We release our code and
data to facilitate reproducibility.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
general domains but perform poorly in some specific domains due to a lack of
domain-specific data, such as image-text data or vedio-text data. In some
specific domains, there is abundant graphic and textual data scattered around,
but lacks standardized arrangement. In the field of medical ultrasound, there
are ultrasonic diagnostic books, ultrasonic clinical guidelines, ultrasonic
diagnostic reports, and so on. However, these ultrasonic materials are often
saved in the forms of PDF, images, etc., and cannot be directly used for the
training of MLLMs. This paper proposes a novel image-text reasoning supervised
fine-tuning data generation pipeline to create specific domain quadruplets
(image, question, thinking trace, and answer) from domain-specific materials. A
medical ultrasound domain dataset ReMUD is established, containing over 45,000
reasoning and non-reasoning supervised fine-tuning Question Answering (QA) and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) data. The ReMUD-7B model, fine-tuned on
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, outperforms general-domain MLLMs in medical ultrasound
field. To facilitate research, the ReMUD dataset, data generation codebase, and
ReMUD-7B parameters will be released at https://github.com/ShiDaizi/ReMUD,

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Effectively representing legal norms for automated processing is a critical
challenge, particularly in tracking the diachronic evolution of their
hierarchical components (e.g., articles, paragraphs). While foundational
frameworks like FRBR/FRBRoo and standards like Akoma Ntoso model legal
documents at a macro level, they lack native mechanisms for granular,
component-level versioning. This limitation hinders the deterministic
point-in-time reconstruction of legal texts, a fundamental capability for
reliable Legal Tech and AI applications. This paper proposes a structured,
temporal model that extends the FRBRoo framework to address this gap. It
introduces specialized subclasses of Expressio - Temporal Version (TV) and
Language Version (LV - to represent the state of a legal norm and its
linguistic variations at specific points in time. The model applies this same
paradigm hierarchically, introducing Component Work (CW), Component Temporal
Version (CTV), and Component Language Version (CLV) to track the lifecycle of
individual articles, paragraphs, and clauses. Using the Brazilian Federal
Constitution as a case study, the paper demonstrates how each amendment creates
new Component Temporal Versions for affected provisions, while unaffected
components retain their existing versions. This fine-grained, time-aware
architecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction of
any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. The model provides a
robust foundation for developing advanced legal information systems, knowledge
graphs, and AI tools capable of accurate historical analysis and impact
assessment, overcoming the limitations of current generative models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revitalized
philosophical debates surrounding artificial intelligence. Two of the most
fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding
Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional
symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the
cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed
two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem,
administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed
and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five
trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including
contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The
results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in
performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction
tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings
suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to
produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical
challenges.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental
knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving
reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated
environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous
decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain
stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time
observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and
context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains
an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding
and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a
domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making
architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)
into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex
tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each
focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike
traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER
integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring
verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence
decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived
insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration
facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.
We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves
exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,
goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven
decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge
for operational success.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical
fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and
strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for
large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical
problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that
are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an
informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two
automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction.
Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of
Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched
with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel
LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four
step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic
evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even
top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise
scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only
final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and
a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and
constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time
computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our
findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided
reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at

Abstract: Foundation model fine-tuning faces a fundamental challenge: existing AutoML
platforms rely on single optimisation strategies that explore only a fraction

Gradients, a decentralised AutoML platform that transforms hyperparameter
optimisation into a competitive marketplace where independent miners compete to
discover optimal configurations. Economic incentives align individual
exploration with collective optimisation goals, driving systematic
investigation of hyperparameter regions that centralised methods miss. We
evaluate our approach across 180 controlled experiments spanning diverse model
architectures (70M to 70B parameters) and task types. Gradients achieves an
82.8\% win rate against HuggingFace AutoTrain and 100\% against TogetherAI,
Databricks, and Google Cloud, with mean improvements of 11.8\% and 42.1\%
respectively. Complex reasoning and retrieval tasks show particularly strong
gains of 30-40\%, whilst diffusion models achieve 23.4\% improvements for
person-specific generation. These results demonstrate that competitive,
economically-driven approaches can systematically discover superior
configurations that centralised AutoML consistently miss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of inaccurate image-text alignment in LMMs, which often leads to text responses that contradict visual input or fail to follow text-to-image prompts.

Method: The method involves sampling multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, reversing the input-output pairs to compute dual likelihood as self-rewards for optimization.

Result: The results show that the method effectively enhances model performance without external supervision, with significant improvements in text-to-image tasks.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the self-supervised dual reward mechanism can improve both understanding and generation in LMMs by utilizing the inverse relationship between tasks.

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models
(LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework.
However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to
generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow
the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision
(e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional
tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the
observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we
introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the
understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample
multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the
input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards
for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the
performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving
remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control

this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:
  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both
agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that
tests both agent coordination and communication,
  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse,
verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and
controlled complexity,
  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose
behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation
fidelity,
  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations
including separating errors arising from reasoning vs
communication/coordination.
  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents
shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding
users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that
must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing

thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates
self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal
GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training,
offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning.
GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated
data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation.
Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically
construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful
trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI
understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and
evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a
diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of
GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection
tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to
continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our
framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities,
paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with
all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.

Motivation: Current GraphRAG evaluation frameworks have issues with unrelated questions and bias, leading to misleading performance conclusions.

Method: Unbiased evaluation framework using graph-text-grounded question generation and improved answer assessment procedures.

Result: Performance gains of GraphRAG methods are more moderate than previously reported.

Conclusion: The proposed framework highlights the need for scientific evaluations to support reliable GraphRAG research.

Abstract: By retrieving contexts from knowledge graphs, graph-based retrieval-augmented
generation (GraphRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) to generate quality
answers for user questions. Many GraphRAG methods have been proposed and
reported inspiring performance in answer quality. However, we observe that the
current answer evaluation framework for GraphRAG has two critical flaws, i.e.,
unrelated questions and evaluation biases, which may lead to biased or even
wrong conclusions on performance. To tackle the two flaws, we propose an
unbiased evaluation framework that uses graph-text-grounded question generation
to produce questions that are more related to the underlying dataset and an
unbiased evaluation procedure to eliminate the biases in LLM-based answer
assessment. We apply our unbiased framework to evaluate 3 representative
GraphRAG methods and find that their performance gains are much more moderate
than reported previously. Although our evaluation framework may still have
flaws, it calls for scientific evaluations to lay solid foundations for
GraphRAG research.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and efficient, providing a scalable way to build speech LLMs without speech data.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising
results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing

computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and
accessibility. In this paper, we present \textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework
that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our
key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent
text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output

enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based
inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong

Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and
Russian achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%, with
particularly strong performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of
45.39%. In production, this unified approach significantly reduces
computational resources and maintenance overhead compared to maintaining
separate models for each game and language combination. At Ubisoft, this model
successfully identifies an average of 50 players, per game, per day engaging in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve table interpretation by detecting column relationships in unlabeled data using KGs.

Method: Hybrid approach combining LLMs and statistical analysis, including domain/range constraints detection and relation co-appearance analysis.

Result: The methodology showed competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches on SemTab benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid method effectively reduces search space for CPA tasks and is publicly available on github.

Abstract: Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant
progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and
benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for
detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to
reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this
approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints
detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental
evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses
the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different
state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were
performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed
methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive
with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural
language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex
decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with
high-level objectives. Existing methods either rely on short-term
auto-regressive action generation or face limitations in accurately simulating
rollouts and assessing outcomes, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This paper
introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that
effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a
principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1)
extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits
associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory
rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a
gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including
high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text),
and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and
superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves
competitive performance using 7B/8B parameter LLMs, even outperforming baseline
methods employing GPT-4 in complex tasks. These results underscore the
potential of integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' intrinsic
knowledge to advance decision-making capabilities in multi-step environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt
injection attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. Existing
defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and
generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt
injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To
address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion
detection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic
feature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, the
framework employs DeBERTa-v3-base as a feature extractor to transform input
text into semantic vectors enriched with contextual information. In parallel,
we design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit
structural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels
are subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to
produce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the
limitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental
results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms
existing methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, when
deployed actually, it significantly reduces attack success rates across
mainstream LLMs, including GLM-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2.5, and GPT-4o.

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the battlefield, Internet of
Battlefield Things (IoBT), gives rise to new opportunities for enhancing
situational awareness. To increase the potential of IoBT for situational
awareness in critical decision making, the data from these devices must be
processed into consumer-ready information objects, and made available to
consumers on demand. To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes
use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and
return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language
Models (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as
graphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which
are pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping
questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to
summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate
several medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing
publicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at
the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion
parameters) outperforms the other models across all the considered metrics.
Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach
allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced
Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4%
increase in accuracy. Our workflow lays the ground work for deploying LLMs on
edge devices to enable natural language interactions with databases containing
information objects for critical decision making.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Lightweight Large Language Models (LwLLMs) are reduced-parameter, optimized
models designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, offering
significant advantages in resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and data
privacy. However, these models often struggle with limited inference and
reasoning capabilities, which restrict their performance on complex tasks and
limit their practical applicability. Moreover, existing prompt optimization
methods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive
abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs. To
address these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior
Optimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
technique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method,
which focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In
particular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the
optimization of discrete, quantifiable execution sequences using a
gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate DeBoP on seven challenging
tasks where state-of-the-art LLMs excel but LwLLMs generally underperform.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeBoP significantly outperforms recent
prompt optimization methods on most tasks. In particular, DeBoP-optimized
LwLLMs surpass GPT-3.5 on most tasks while reducing computational time by
approximately 60% compared to other automatic prompt optimization methods.

Abstract: The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand,
leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human
values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises
significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful
information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with
value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these
challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are
more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit
slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned
models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely
generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful
outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant
correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by
psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of
value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety
of value-aligned LLMs.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of high training costs and degraded language capabilities in existing methods for building multimodal MoE models.

Result: Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text, outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have become a key approach for scaling
large language models, with growing interest in extending them to multimodal
tasks. Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high

expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying
on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: State of the art large language models are trained using large amounts of
tokens derived from raw text using what is called a tokenizer. Crucially, the
tokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference
as well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the
token vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the
tokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the
canonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest
that large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,
and this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show
that, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate
(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive
generation process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical
result, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method
that precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.
Further, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the
distribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably
closer to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.

*Kaiser Sun,Fan Bai,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to evaluate how LLMs handle conflicting information between context and their internal knowledge, finding that models struggle to suppress their knowledge even when told to, and that providing conflict explanations increases context reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often face conflicts between contextual input and parametric knowledge, which can affect task performance. Current evaluations may not account for these conflicts, leading to potential issues in real-world deployment.

Method: The paper proposes a diagnostic framework to systematically assess LLM behavior under context-memory conflicts. They create diagnostic data to trigger these conflicts and analyze model performance across various tasks.

Result: The study found that knowledge conflicts have little effect on tasks not requiring knowledge, performance drops when context and knowledge align, models can't fully suppress internal knowledge even with instructions, and providing rationales for conflicts makes them rely more on context.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of considering knowledge conflicts in LLM evaluations and deployment, suggesting that current model-based assessments may not be reliable due to these conflicts.

Abstract: Large language models frequently rely on both contextual input and parametric
knowledge to perform tasks. However, these sources can come into conflict,
especially when retrieved documents contradict the model's parametric
knowledge. We propose a diagnostic framework to systematically evaluate LLM
behavior under context-memory conflict, where the contextual information
diverges from their parametric beliefs. We construct diagnostic data that
elicit these conflicts and analyze model performance across multiple task
types. Our findings reveal that (1) knowledge conflict has minimal impact on
tasks that do not require knowledge utilization, (2) model performance is
consistently higher when contextual and parametric knowledge are aligned, (3)
models are unable to fully suppress their internal knowledge even when
instructed, and (4) providing rationales that explain the conflict increases
reliance on contexts. These insights raise concerns about the validity of
model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge
conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Electronic design engineers often struggle to efficiently access relevant

While large language models (LLMs) can enhance productivity as conversational
agents, pre-trained open-source LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for
Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
context, LLMs rely on external context but may still produce inaccurate
responses. Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) improves LLM performance, but
acquiring labeled question/answer (Q/A) data in EDA is difficult. To address
this, we propose using synthetic Q/A datasets to enhance LLMs with RAFT. Our
results show that RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance
for RAG-based EDA tasks. We also investigate the impact of using real user
questions as Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples for synthetic data
generation. Additionally, we implement secure access control to ensure
sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Finally, we
assess the risk of data leakage and unintended memorization during fine-tuning
with synthetic data, providing practical insights.

Abstract: To build fair AI systems we need to understand how social-group biases
intrinsic to foundational encoder-based vision-language models (VLMs) manifest
in biases in downstream tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic
biases in VLM representations systematically ``carry over'' or propagate into
zero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing how deeply rooted biases shape a model's
outputs. We introduce a controlled framework to measure this propagation by
correlating (a) intrinsic measures of bias in the representational space with
(b) extrinsic measures of bias in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and
image-to-text (ITT) retrieval. Results show substantial correlations between
intrinsic and extrinsic bias, with an average $\rho$ = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.10. This
pattern is consistent across 114 analyses, both retrieval directions, six
social groups, and three distinct VLMs. Notably, we find that
larger/better-performing models exhibit greater bias propagation, a finding
that raises concerns given the trend towards increasingly complex AI models.
Our framework introduces baseline evaluation tasks to measure the propagation
of group and valence signals. Investigations reveal that underrepresented
groups experience less robust propagation, further skewing their model-related
outcomes.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on
post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction
following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training
datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to
the public, with limited information about their construction process. This
lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source
post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield
performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain
challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them
rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains
unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence
downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open
post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie
framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including
turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and
response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and
qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on
these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data
mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset
while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings
offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training
datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To
support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets
and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: When exposed to complex queries containing multiple conditions, today's large
language models (LLMs) tend to produce responses that only partially satisfy
the query while neglecting certain conditions. We therefore introduce the
concept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit
(neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented
query parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated
generation. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce
FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068
problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination
benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the
fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on
FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for
state-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or
misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an
automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting
intent hallucination. Human evaluation results demonstrate that CONSTRAINT
SCORE is closer to human performance for intent hallucination compared to
baselines.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A central challenge in modern language models (LMs) is intrinsic
hallucination: the generation of information that is plausible but
unsubstantiated relative to input context. To study this problem, we propose
Precise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models
to generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short
self-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any
unsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests
a model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting
that requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We
present PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,
summarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are
supplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range
of open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,
state-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To
alleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework,
using a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B
PIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full
PIC setting. When integrated into end-to-end factual generation pipelines,
PIC-LM improves exact match recall by 17.1% on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and
factual precision by 30.5% on a birthplace verification task, underscoring the
potential of precisely grounded generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a training-free method to transplant tokenizers in pretrained
large language models (LLMs) by reconstructing unseen token embeddings via
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Specifically, we approximate each
out-of-vocabulary token as a sparse linear combination of shared tokens, in two
phases: first, compute each new token's representation in the donor embedding
space with a small dictionary of shared anchor tokens, then transfer these same
sparse coefficients back into the base model's embedding space.
  On two challenging cross-tokenizer tasks--Llama$\to$Mistral NeMo (12B) and
Qwen$\to$Llama (1B)--we show that OMP achieves best zero-shot preservation of
the base model's performance across multiple benchmarks, while other zero-shot
approaches degrade significantly. Compared to baselines (zero-init, mean-init,
and existing approaches like WECHSEL, FOCUS, ZETT), OMP consistently achieves
the best overall performance, effectively bridging large tokenizer
discrepancies without gradient updates. Our analysis further identifies
mismatched numerical tokenization schemes as a critical challenge for
preserving mathematical reasoning capabilities. This technique enables direct
reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers, facilitating
cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation, speculative decoding, ensembling,
merging, and domain-specific vocabulary adaptations. We integrate our method
into the open-source mergekit-tokensurgeon tool for post hoc vocabulary

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Affine mappings between residual streams of language models allow efficient transfer of features, reducing FLOPs when training SAEs on larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To train expensive components like SAEs on smaller models and transfer to larger ones, saving computational resources.

Method: Using affine mappings to transfer SAE weights between models of different sizes.

Result: Small and large models have similar representation spaces; transferred SAEs on larger models require 50% fewer FLOPs.

Conclusion: Affine mappings show promise for improving training efficiency of SAEs while preserving feature utility.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of
language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features
between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their
representations. We find that small and large models learn highly similar
representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs
on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. For
example, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to
50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show
that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground
truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability,
finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently
while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully
mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the
linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method
for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable detection of depressive language in social media
is useful for early interventions of mental health conditions, and has
important implications for both clinical practice and broader public health
efforts. In this paper, we investigate the performance of large language models
(LLMs) and traditional machine learning classifiers across three classification
tasks involving social media data: binary depression classification, depression
severity classification, and differential diagnosis classification among
depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Our study compares zero-shot LLMs with
supervised classifiers trained on both conventional text embeddings and
LLM-generated summary embeddings. Our experiments reveal that while zero-shot
LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification,
they struggle with fine-grained ordinal classifications. In contrast,
classifiers trained on summary embeddings generated by LLMs demonstrate
competitive, and in some cases superior, performance on the classification
tasks, particularly when compared to models using traditional text embeddings.
Our findings demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in mental health prediction, and
suggest promising directions for better utilization of their zero-shot
capabilities and context-aware summarization techniques.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the
writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough
understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but
also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new
direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges.
To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce
BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for
language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument
summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we
describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models
perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite
good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating
human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our
benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases.
We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will
specifically aid people in performing legal work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-session psychological counseling dataset (MusPsy-Dataset) and a corresponding model (MusPsy-Model) that improves over time by tracking client progress and adapting counseling strategies, outperforming baselines in multi-session scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in current research that focuses on single-session counseling, which does not reflect the real-world, multi-session nature of psychological counseling. The goal is to create a dataset and model that can handle sustained, progressive conversations to better address client issues.

Method: The paper introduces the MusPsy-Dataset, created from real client profiles in public psychological case reports, capturing multi-session conversations. They also developed the MusPsy-Model, which tracks client progress and adapts counseling direction over time.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the MusPsy-Model outperforms baseline models in multi-session psychological counseling tasks, indicating improved performance through sustained engagement and adaptation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their dataset and model provide a more realistic approach to automated psychological counseling by simulating the multi-session process, leading to better client outcome tracking and adaptive counseling strategies.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in automated psychological counseling. However, current research focuses on
single-session counseling, which doesn't represent real-world scenarios. In
practice, psychological counseling is a process, not a one-time event,
requiring sustained, multi-session engagement to progressively address clients'
issues. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dataset for Multi-Session
Psychological Counseling Conversation Dataset (MusPsy-Dataset). Our
MusPsy-Dataset is constructed using real client profiles from publicly
available psychological case reports. It captures the dynamic arc of
counseling, encompassing multiple progressive counseling conversations from the
same client across different sessions. Leveraging our dataset, we also
developed our MusPsy-Model, which aims to track client progress and adapt its
counseling direction over time. Experiments show that our model performs better
than baseline models across multiple sessions.

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs), the safety of
LLMs has raised significant concerns. However, there is still a lack of
definitive standards for evaluating their safety due to the subjective nature
of current safety benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted the first
exploration of LLMs' safety evaluation from a legal perspective by proposing
the SafeLawBench benchmark. SafeLawBench categorizes safety risks into three
levels based on legal standards, providing a systematic and comprehensive
framework for evaluation. It comprises 24,860 multi-choice questions and 1,106
open-domain question-answering (QA) tasks. Our evaluation included 2
closed-source LLMs and 18 open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, highlighting the safety features of each model. We also evaluated
the LLMs' safety-related reasoning stability and refusal behavior.
Additionally, we found that a majority voting mechanism can enhance model
performance. Notably, even leading SOTA models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
GPT-4o have not exceeded 80.5% accuracy in multi-choice tasks on SafeLawBench,
while the average accuracy of 20 LLMs remains at 68.8\%. We urge the community
to prioritize research on the safety of LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured prediction
tasks, including regression, but existing approaches primarily focus on point
estimates and lack systematic comparison across different methods. We
investigate probabilistic regression using LLMs for unstructured inputs,
addressing challenging text-to-distribution prediction tasks such as price
estimation where both nuanced text understanding and uncertainty quantification
are critical. We propose a novel quantile regression approach that enables LLMs
to produce full predictive distributions, improving upon traditional point
estimates. Through extensive experiments across three diverse price prediction
datasets, we demonstrate that a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned with quantile heads
significantly outperforms traditional approaches for both point and
distributional estimations, as measured by three established metrics each for
prediction accuracy and distributional calibration. Our systematic comparison
of LLM approaches, model architectures, training approaches, and data scaling
reveals that Mistral-7B consistently outperforms encoder architectures,
embedding-based methods, and few-shot learning methods. Our experiments also
reveal the effectiveness of LLM-assisted label correction in achieving
human-level accuracy without systematic bias. Our curated datasets are made

TL;DR: This paper introduces distribution-wise interventions for language models, which extend representation fine-tuning to the distribution level, improving controllability and robustness across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the controllability and robustness of language models by moving beyond pointwise interventions to consider the distributional aspects of concept subspaces.

Method: The method involves extending learnable interventions from pointwise transformations within the concept subspace to also include the surrounding regions of the distribution, allowing for more comprehensive control over model behavior.

Result: The results show that distribution-wise interventions outperform pointwise interventions in controllability and robustness on eight commonsense reasoning and seven arithmetic reasoning benchmarks, with larger standard deviations correlating with better performance.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that distribution-wise interventions offer a more effective and fine-grained approach to steering language model behavior compared to traditional pointwise methods.

Abstract: Interventions in language models (LMs) are applied strategically to steer
model behavior during the forward pass. Learnable interventions, also known as
representation fine-tuning, aim to apply pointwise control within the concept
subspace and have proven effective in altering high-level behaviors. In this
work, we extend this approach to the distribution level, enabling the model to
learn not only pointwise transformations but also the surrounding regions of
the concept subspace. We demonstrate that these methods perform effectively in
early layers, with larger standard deviations correlating strongly with
improved performance. Across eight commonsense reasoning and seven arithmetic
reasoning benchmarks, our distribution-wise interventions consistently
outperform pointwise interventions in controllability and robustness. These
results illustrate that distribution-wise interventions provide a more
comprehensive method for steering model behavior and enabling finer-grained
control over language models. The code is at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational paradigm for
equipping large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, playing a
critical role in information retrieval and knowledge-intensive applications.
However, conventional RAG systems typically adopt a static
retrieve-then-generate pipeline and rely on in-context knowledge injection,
which can be suboptimal for complex tasks that require multihop reasoning,
adaptive information access, and deeper integration of external knowledge.
Motivated by these limitations, the research community has moved beyond static
retrieval and in-context knowledge injection. Among the emerging directions,
this tutorial delves into two rapidly growing and complementary research areas
on RAG: Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG. Dynamic RAG adaptively determines when
and what to retrieve during the LLM's generation process, enabling real-time
adaptation to the LLM's evolving information needs. Parametric RAG rethinks how
retrieved knowledge should be injected into LLMs, transitioning from
input-level to parameter-level knowledge injection for enhanced efficiency and
effectiveness. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of recent advances
in these emerging research areas. It also shares theoretical foundations and
practical insights to support and inspire further research in RAG.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Detecting LLM-generated text in specialized and high-stakes domains like
medicine and law is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring
authenticity. However, current zero-shot detectors, while effective on general
text, often fail when applied to specialized content due to domain shift. We
provide a theoretical analysis showing this failure is fundamentally linked to
the KL divergence between human, detector, and source text distributions. To
address this, we propose DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework using
normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation to robustly
identify LLM-generated text in specialized domains. We also release a
domain-specific benchmark for LLM-generated text detection in the medical and
legal domains. Experiments on our benchmark show that DivScore consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, with 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0%
higher recall (0.1% false positive rate threshold). In adversarial settings,
DivScore demonstrates superior robustness than other baselines, achieving on
average 22.8% advantage in AUROC and 29.5% in recall. Code and data are
publicly available.

Abstract: Retentive Network (RetNet) represents a significant advancement in neural
network architecture, offering an efficient alternative to the Transformer.
While Transformers rely on self-attention to model dependencies, they suffer
from high memory costs and limited scalability when handling long sequences due
to their quadratic complexity. To mitigate these limitations, RetNet introduces
a retention mechanism that unifies the inductive bias of recurrence with the
global dependency modeling of attention. This mechanism enables linear-time
inference, facilitates efficient modeling of extended contexts, and remains
compatible with fully parallelizable training pipelines. RetNet has garnered
significant research interest due to its consistently demonstrated cross-domain
effectiveness, achieving robust performance across machine learning paradigms
including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series
analysis. However, a comprehensive review of RetNet is still missing from the
current literature. This paper aims to fill that gap by offering the first
detailed survey of the RetNet architecture, its key innovations, and its
diverse applications. We also explore the main challenges associated with
RetNet and propose future research directions to support its continued
advancement in both academic research and practical deployment.

Abstract: Navigating healthcare systems can be complex and overwhelming, creating
barriers for patients seeking timely and appropriate medical attention. In this
paper, we introduce C-PATH (Conversational Patient Assistance and Triage in
Healthcare), a novel conversational AI system powered by large language models
(LLMs) designed to assist patients in recognizing symptoms and recommending
appropriate medical departments through natural, multi-turn dialogues. C-PATH
is fine-tuned on medical knowledge, dialogue data, and clinical summaries using
a multi-stage pipeline built on the LLaMA3 architecture. A core contribution of
this work is a GPT-based data augmentation framework that transforms structured
clinical knowledge from DDXPlus into lay-person-friendly conversations,
allowing alignment with patient communication norms. We also implement a
scalable conversation history management strategy to ensure long-range
coherence. Evaluation with GPTScore demonstrates strong performance across
dimensions such as clarity, informativeness, and recommendation accuracy.
Quantitative benchmarks show that C-PATH achieves superior performance in
GPT-rewritten conversational datasets, significantly outperforming
domain-specific baselines. C-PATH represents a step forward in the development
of user-centric, accessible, and accurate AI tools for digital health
assistance and triage.

Motivation: To address the growing concern about geopolitical biases in large language models (LLMs) and their tendency to favor specific national narratives when interpreting historical events with conflicting perspectives.

Method: The paper introduces a novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from different countries (USA, UK, USSR, and China). It evaluates LLMs' interpretations and tests the effectiveness of simple debiasing prompts. Experiments with manipulated participant labels are conducted to assess models' sensitivity to attribution.

Result: Significant geopolitical biases were found in LLMs, with models favoring certain national narratives. Simple debiasing prompts had limited success in reducing these biases. The models showed sensitivity to attribution, sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies when labels were swapped.

Conclusion: This work highlights the presence of national narrative biases in LLMs, questions the effectiveness of straightforward debiasing approaches, and presents a framework and dataset for further research into geopolitical bias.

Abstract: Implicit content plays a crucial role in political discourse, where speakers
systematically employ pragmatic strategies such as implicatures and
presuppositions to influence their audiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex semantic and
pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and
explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this
within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the
first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political
speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose
methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through
a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that
all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We
conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for
accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in
political discourse. At the same time, we highlight promising trends and future
directions for enhancing model performance. We release our data and code at

Abstract: The taggedPBC (Ring 2025a) contains more than 1,800 sentences of pos-tagged
parallel text data from over 1,500 languages, representing 133 language
families and 111 isolates. While this dwarfs previously available resources,
and the POS tags achieve decent accuracy, allowing for predictive
crosslinguistic insights (Ring 2025b), the dataset was not initially annotated
for dependencies. This paper reports on a CoNLLU-formatted version of the
dataset which transfers dependency information along with POS tags to all
languages in the taggedPBC. Although there are various concerns regarding the
quality of the tags and the dependencies, word order information derived from
this dataset regarding the position of arguments and predicates in transitive
clauses correlates with expert determinations of word order in three
typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp). This highlights the usefulness
of corpus-based typological approaches (as per Baylor et al. 2023; Bjerva 2024)
for extending comparisons of discrete linguistic categories, and suggests that
important insights can be gained even from noisy data, given sufficient
annotation. The dependency-annotated corpora are also made available for

Abstract: Previous work has showcased the intriguing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in instruction-following and rhetorical fluency. However,
systematic exploration of their dual capabilities to autonomously persuade and
resist persuasion, particularly in contexts involving psychological rhetoric,
remains unexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs
by tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial
dialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ
repetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven
comprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly
instructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and
Repetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates. However, no
``one-size-fits-all'' strategy proves universally effective, with performance
heavily dependent on contextual counterfactuals. Motivated by these
observations, we propose an adaptive framework based on direct preference
optimization that trains LLMs to autonomously select optimal strategies by
leveraging persuasion results from strategy-specific responses as preference
pairs. Experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that the proposed adaptive
psychological persuasion method effectively enables persuader LLMs to select
optimal strategies, significantly enhancing their success rates while
maintaining general capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification
increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient
domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification.
Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes
predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions
based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are
matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We
integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy
loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined
target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our
proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility
across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new
state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several
strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in
Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

Motivation: To investigate whether language models can reliably predict that possible events are more likely than improbable ones.

Method: Analyzing the models' predictions by separating possibility, typicality, and contextual relatedness.

Result: Models like Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo often assign higher probabilities to impossible sentences than to unlikely ones.

Conclusion: Language models' ability to assess event likelihood is not robust, highlighting limitations in their understanding of real-world constraints.

Abstract: Can language models reliably predict that possible events are more likely

language models' ability to do this is far from robust. In fact, under certain
conditions, all models tested - including Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo -
perform at worse-than-chance level, assigning higher probabilities to
impossible sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket by the brake'
than to merely unlikely sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to combine narrative and difficulty control in QG for better educational tailored questions, as existing research lacks this integration.

Method: The method involves proposing a strategy for joint control of narrative and difficulty in generating reading comprehension questions.

Result: The evaluation shows the approach is feasible but not effective in all cases, with specific conditions where it works better.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while the strategy is feasible, there are trade-offs and conditions where it performs optimally, suggesting areas for future research.

Abstract: Question Generation (QG), the task of automatically generating questions from
a source input, has seen significant progress in recent years.
Difficulty-controllable QG (DCQG) enables control over the difficulty level of
generated questions while considering the learner's ability. Additionally,
narrative-controllable QG (NCQG) allows control over the narrative aspects
embedded in the questions. However, research in QG lacks a focus on combining
these two types of control, which is important for generating questions
tailored to educational purposes. To address this gap, we propose a strategy
for Joint Narrative and Difficulty Control, enabling simultaneous control over
these two attributes in the generation of reading comprehension questions. Our
evaluation provides preliminary evidence that this approach is feasible, though
it is not effective across all instances. Our findings highlight the conditions
under which the strategy performs well and discuss the trade-offs associated
with its application.

are commonly recommended to address these biases, this paper empirically tests
the effectiveness of such approaches in the context of gender, religion, and
nationality-based identities in Bengali, a widely spoken but low-resourced
language. We conducted an algorithmic audit of sentiment analysis models built
on mBERT and BanglaBERT, which were fine-tuned using all Bengali sentiment
analysis (BSA) datasets from Google Dataset Search. Our analyses showed that
BSA models exhibit biases across different identity categories despite having
similar semantic content and structure. We also examined the inconsistencies
and uncertainties arising from combining pre-trained models and datasets
created by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds. We connected these
findings to the broader discussions on epistemic injustice, AI alignment, and
methodological decisions in algorithmic audits.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for emotion reasoning in AudioLLMs to improve emotion recognition and generate evidence-based explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat emotion understanding as classification, lacking insight into prediction rationales. The paper aims to enhance emotion recognition with generative capabilities for explanations.

Method: Unified framework with reasoning-augmented data supervision, dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training to support emotion reasoning in multitask AudioLLMs.

Result: Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show improved emotion prediction accuracy and more coherent, evidence-grounded responses.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enables AudioLLMs to learn multiple tasks with emotional reasoning, enhancing both accuracy and explanation quality.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in
semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in
modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat
emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into
the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion
reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs
to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned,
evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we
introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision,
dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables
AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional
reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only
improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and
evidential grounding of the generated responses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However,
the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through
test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem
from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose
TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This
benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in
(1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further
(2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written
code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can
generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to
generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively.
Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly
short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators.
Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of
instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the
performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both
prompting and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Disinformation detection is a key aspect of media literacy. Psychological
studies have shown that knowledge of persuasive fallacies helps individuals
detect disinformation. Inspired by these findings, we experimented with large
language models (LLMs) to test whether infusing persuasion knowledge enhances
disinformation detection. As a result, we introduce the Persuasion-Augmented
Chain of Thought (PCoT), a novel approach that leverages persuasion to improve
disinformation detection in zero-shot classification. We extensively evaluate
PCoT on online news and social media posts. Moreover, we publish two novel,
up-to-date disinformation datasets: EUDisinfo and MultiDis. These datasets
enable the evaluation of PCoT on content entirely unseen by the LLMs used in
our experiments, as the content was published after the models' knowledge
cutoffs. We show that, on average, PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15%
across five LLMs and five datasets. These findings highlight the value of
persuasion in strengthening zero-shot disinformation detection.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a common method for
fine-tuning large language models, where a base model can serve multiple users
through PEFT module switching. To enhance user experience, base models require
periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous
versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions.
Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant
computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur
during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual
training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward
Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the
Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel
approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern
while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model. Further
theoretical analysis supports our approach. Extensive experiments across 7 base
models and 12 datasets demonstrate that Trans-PEFT trained modules can maintain
performance on updated base models without re-tuning, significantly reducing
maintenance overhead in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to identify and correct the unsound reasoning processes in LLMs that lead to correct answers but lack proper mathematical justification.

Method: The method involves creating a dataset with fine-grained annotations (MathOlympiadEval) and developing a step-by-step verification approach (ParaStepVerifier) to detect reasoning flaws in mathematical solutions.

Result: Empirical results show that ParaStepVerifier significantly improves the accuracy of detecting flawed solutions, particularly in complex, multi-step problems, compared to existing automated methods.

Conclusion: ParaStepVerifier provides a more robust methodology for evaluating and training LLMs to ensure genuine mathematical reasoning, bridging the gap between answer correctness and process correctness.

Abstract: Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in mathematical problem-solving. However, this success often masks a
critical issue: models frequently achieve correct answers through fundamentally
unsound reasoning processes, a phenomenon indicative of reward hacking. We
introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which
reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low
process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to
reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose
ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification
of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning
steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially
improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines,
especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path
towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic mixture approach during beam search decoding to combine small models and LLMs for Chinese Spelling Check, improving precision and fluency without LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in LLMs for CSC, their performance is still unsatisfactory. BERT-based models perform well but overfit to edit patterns. The goal is to combine the strengths of both without fine-tuning LLMs.

Method: A dynamic mixture method that combines probability distributions of small models and LLMs during beam search decoding, avoiding LLM fine-tuning.

Result: The approach significantly improves error correction, achieving SOTA results on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The dynamic mixture method effectively balances precise corrections from small models and fluency from LLMs, without needing LLM fine-tuning, enabling efficient domain adaptation.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), the Chinese Spelling Check (CSC)
task has seen various LLM methods developed, yet their performance remains
unsatisfactory. In contrast, fine-tuned BERT-based models, relying on
high-quality in-domain data, show excellent performance but suffer from edit
pattern overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that
effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs
during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of
precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach
also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and
resources, and facilitating domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our mixture approach significantly boosts error correction
capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets. Our

TL;DR: This study examines how AAE features like CCR and ING-reduction affect ASR accuracy, finding that they increase WER and that LM-free systems are more influenced by lexical neighborhood effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why ASR models have higher error rates for AAE, focusing on specific linguistic features and the role of language models in mitigating these errors.

Method: The study uses the CORAAL corpus transcribed with wav2vec 2.0, both with and without an LM. CCR and ING-reduction are detected with MFA and pronunciation expansion. They analyze WER and compare the effects of lexical neighborhood and contextual predictability between LM-free and LM-equipped systems.

Result: The analysis shows that CCR and ING-reduction significantly increase WER. LM-free ASR systems exhibit a stronger lexical neighborhood effect compared to those with an LM.

Conclusion: The study concludes that AAE features like CCR and ING-reduction contribute to higher ASR errors, and that incorporating an LM can reduce the impact of lexical neighborhood effects, suggesting that LMs help in contextual prediction for AAE speech.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic,
phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English
(AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction
(CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and
ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates
whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more
influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability
compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American
Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR
and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with
pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of
CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of
lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that existing language models often fail to maintain long-term discourse structure in news articles, which affects reader engagement due to the importance of organizational flow in such content.

Method: The method involves creating a new summarization dataset with multiple summaries of news articles across social media platforms, developing a news discourse schema to describe summarization structures, and introducing DiscoSum, an algorithm that uses beam search for structure-aware summarization.

Result: The results show that the proposed approach effectively maintains narrative fidelity and meets structural requirements, supported by both human and automatic evaluations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that integrating discourse structure into summarization processes improves the quality and engagement of summaries, particularly for news articles, and the DiscoSum algorithm is effective in achieving this.

Abstract: Recent advances in text summarization have predominantly leveraged large
language models to generate concise summaries. However, language models often
do not maintain long-term discourse structure, especially in news articles,
where organizational flow significantly influences reader engagement. We
introduce a novel approach to integrating discourse structure into
summarization processes, focusing specifically on news articles across various
media. We present a novel summarization dataset where news articles are
summarized multiple times in different ways across different social media
platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.). We develop a novel news discourse
schema to describe summarization structures and a novel algorithm, DiscoSum,
which employs beam search technique for structure-aware summarization, enabling
the transformation of news stories to meet different stylistic and structural
demands. Both human and automatic evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in maintaining narrative fidelity and meeting structural
requirements.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have progressed towards more human-like and
human--AI communications have become prevalent, prompting has emerged as a
decisive component. However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what
exactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this
question by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150
prompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025
and blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating
prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We
then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their
imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps.
Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural
language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically
explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that
single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we
discover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in
better reasoning models. Our findings establish a foundation for
property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging the gaps between
human--AI communication and opening new prompting research directions.

Motivation: To evaluate belief-inconsistent reasoning in LLMs, addressing the gap in existing datasets that focus on general or belief-aligned reasoning.

Method: Creation of BIS Reasoning 1.0, a large-scale Japanese syllogistic reasoning dataset with logically valid but belief-inconsistent problems, and benchmarking state-of-the-art models.

Result: GPT-4o achieved 79.54% accuracy, showing significant variance in performance among models and critical weaknesses in handling belief-conflicting inputs.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for LLMs to prioritize truth over intuitive beliefs in high-stakes applications to ensure integrity and safety.

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of
syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate
belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior
datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned
reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent
syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned
corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude
models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in
performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies
critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but
belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific
literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and
safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve QA agents by enabling them to ask clarifying questions, enhancing their ability to handle ambiguous queries and improve answer accuracy.

Method: The method involves simulating conversations with clarifying questions and using offline RL with reward-weighted SFT for training, which is more practical than prior approaches.

Result: The results show improvements in both optimized rewards and language quality when compared to SFT and direct preference optimization methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that their approach is more effective and practical for training QA agents to ask clarifying questions, offering better performance with fewer hyper-parameters.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) agents automatically answer questions posed in
natural language. In this work, we learn to ask clarifying questions in QA
agents. The key idea in our method is to simulate conversations that contain
clarifying questions and learn from them using reinforcement learning (RL). To
make RL practical, we propose and analyze offline RL objectives that can be
viewed as reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and easily optimized in
large language models. Our work stands in a stark contrast to recently proposed
methods, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional
hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize rewards. We compare to these
methods empirically and report gains in both optimized rewards and language
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a systematic way to analyze the telicity and culminativity of events across languages, focusing on boundedness, subtyping, and modification in noun phrases and events.

Method: A dependently-typed cross-linguistic framework extending Martin-L"of type theory, with formalizations in Agda for nominal and verbal domains.

Result: The framework successfully models boundedness in noun phrases and telic/culminating events in the verbal domain, along with their associated entailments.

Conclusion: This approach provides a formal and systematic method for analyzing event properties, applicable across languages and supported by Agda verification.

Abstract: We present a dependently-typed cross-linguistic framework for analyzing the
telicity and culminativity of events, accompanied by examples of using our
framework to model English sentences. Our framework consists of two parts. In
the nominal domain, we model the boundedness of noun phrases and its
relationship to subtyping, delimited quantities, and adjectival modification.
In the verbal domain we define a dependent event calculus, modeling telic
events as those whose undergoer is bounded, culminating events as telic events
that achieve their inherent endpoint, and consider adverbial modification. In
both domains we pay particular attention to associated entailments. Our
framework is defined as an extension of intensional Martin-L\"of dependent type
theory, and the rules and examples in this paper have been formalized in the
Agda proof assistant.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks
requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem
solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens
and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models
truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this
paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by
introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured
prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations
derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as
storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering,
and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely
degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly
improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to
semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the
fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the
need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting
robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to
promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Scientific texts often convey authority due to their technical language and
complex data. However, this complexity can sometimes lead to the spread of
misinformation. Non-experts are particularly susceptible to misleading claims
based on scientific tables due to their high information density and perceived
credibility. Existing table claim verification models, including
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), often struggle with precise
fine-grained reasoning, resulting in errors and a lack of precision in
verifying scientific claims. Inspired by Cognitive Load Theory, we propose that
enhancing a model's ability to interpret table-based claims involves reducing
cognitive load by developing modular, reusable reasoning components (i.e.,
atomic skills). We introduce a skill-chaining schema that dynamically composes
these skills to facilitate more accurate and generalizable reasoning with a
reduced cognitive load. To evaluate this, we create SciAtomicBench, a
cross-domain benchmark with fine-grained reasoning annotations. With only 350
fine-tuning examples, our model trained by atomic reasoning outperforms
GPT-4o's chain-of-thought method, achieving state-of-the-art results with far
less training data.

Motivation: LLMs lack deep insights in their training data for complex reasoning tasks, and this paper aims to address that by incorporating human-like methodologies.

Method: CoM uses human-defined methodologies to activate systematic reasoning in LLMs, leveraging their metacognitive abilities without explicit fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show CoM outperforms baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of training-free prompting for complex reasoning.

Conclusion: CoM demonstrates that training-free methods can bridge the gap to human-level reasoning by using human-like insights.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due
to insufficient in-depth insights in their training data, which are typically
absent in publicly available documents. This paper introduces the Chain of
Methodologies (CoM), an innovative and intuitive prompting framework that
enhances structured thinking by integrating human methodological insights,
enabling LLMs to tackle complex tasks with extended reasoning. CoM leverages
the metacognitive abilities of advanced LLMs, activating systematic reasoning
throught user-defined methodologies without explicit fine-tuning. Experiments
show that CoM surpasses competitive baselines, demonstrating the potential of

Abstract: Metaphors are pervasive in communication, making them crucial for natural
language processing (NLP). Previous research on automatic metaphor processing
predominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which
often reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can
lead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP
progress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing,
particularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset
designed for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM
consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by
fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal
metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose
Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates
sentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural
backgrounds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SEMD on
metaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks. We hope this work increases
awareness of cultural bias in NLP research and contributes to the development
of fairer and more inclusive language models. Our dataset and code are

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong reasoning performance by
emitting long chains of thought. Yet, these verbose traces slow down inference
and often drift into unnecessary detail, known as the overthinking phenomenon.
To better understand LRMs' behavior, we systematically analyze the token-level
misalignment between reasoning and non-reasoning models. While it is expected
that their primary difference lies in the stylistic "thinking cues", LRMs
uniquely exhibit two pivotal, previously under-explored phenomena: a Global
Misalignment Rebound, where their divergence from non-reasoning models persists
or even grows as response length increases, and more critically, a Local
Misalignment Diminish, where the misalignment concentrates at the "thinking
cues" each sentence starts with but rapidly declines in the remaining of the
sentence. Motivated by the Local Misalignment Diminish, we propose
FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method for
cost-quality trade-off. In FoReaL-Decoding, a Leading model leads the first few
tokens for each sentence, and then a weaker draft model completes the following
tokens to the end of each sentence. FoReaL-Decoding adopts a stochastic gate to
smoothly interpolate between the small and the large model. On four popular
math-reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, AMC23),
FoReaL-Decoding reduces theoretical FLOPs by 30 to 50% and trims CoT length by
up to 40%, while preserving 86 to 100% of model performance. These results
establish FoReaL-Decoding as a simple, plug-and-play route to controllable
cost-quality trade-offs in reasoning-centric tasks.

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised
concerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering.
While various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these
risks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as
paraphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against
such basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a
training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text
to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf
instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance
of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically
optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is
both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection
systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,
ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%
on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on
Fast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural
network-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves
an average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and
attack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection
rates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup
highlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the
light of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their
effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most
existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore
multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the
English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be
investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video
LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to
evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource
languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian,
Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is
designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight
culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods
and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities.
ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice
questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k
samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we
also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising
1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL,
that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource
languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual
video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help
ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive
multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data
will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.

Abstract: There are many types of standards in the field of communication. The
traditional consulting model has a long cycle and relies on the knowledge and
experience of experts, making it difficult to meet the rapidly developing
technological demands. This paper combines the fine-tuning of large language
models with the construction of knowledge graphs to implement an intelligent
consultation and question-answering system for communication standards. The
experimental results show that after LoRA tuning on the constructed dataset of
6,587 questions and answers in the field of communication standards,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrates outstanding professional capabilities in the
field of communication standards on the test set. BLEU-4 rose from 18.8564 to
66.8993, and evaluation indicators such as ROUGE also increased significantly,
outperforming the fine-tuning effect of the comparison model
Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Based on the ontology framework containing 6 entity
attributes and 10 relation attributes, a knowledge graph of the communication
standard domain containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations was
constructed, showing a relatively good query accuracy rate. The intelligent
consultation and question-answering system enables the fine-tuned model on the
server side to access the locally constructed knowledge graph and conduct
graphical retrieval of key information first, which is conducive to improving
the question-answering effect. The evaluation using DeepSeek as the Judge on
the test set shows that our RAG framework enables the fine-tuned model to
improve the scores at all five angles, with an average score increase of 2.26%.
And combined with web services and API interfaces, it has achieved very good
results in terms of interaction experience and back-end access, and has very
good practical application value.

Abstract: Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from
narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually.
While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to
fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic
analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic
historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama
3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph
enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted
comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings
reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions
rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical
breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4
extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement
improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture
fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate
robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2
shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We
then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF
representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order
reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification,
temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical
causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types
represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than
ontological violations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their
large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their
effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent
discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the
general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical
limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)
heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation
processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical
scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data
curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data
not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and
general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual
question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a
multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the
curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu
undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its
task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the
potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm
to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop
MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal
and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model
assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical
tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results
show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal
models on most tasks ...

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have mastered abundant simple and explicit
commonsense knowledge through pre-training, enabling them to achieve human-like
performance in simple commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to
reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from
simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an
aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like
math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to
its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with
real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com$^2$ focusing on complex
commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as
structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory~(e.g.,
intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios
that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples
with slow thinking, which is guided by the logical relationships in the
modified causal graphs. Furthermore, we use detective stories to construct a
more challenging subset. Experiments show that LLMs struggle in reasoning depth
and breadth, while post-training and slow thinking can alleviate this. The code

Abstract: Multi-modal affective computing aims to automatically recognize and interpret
human attitudes from diverse data sources such as images and text, thereby
enhancing human-computer interaction and emotion understanding. Existing
approaches typically rely on unimodal analysis or straightforward fusion of
cross-modal information that fail to capture complex and conflicting evidence
presented across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel
LLM-based approach for affective computing that explicitly deconstructs visual
and textual representations into shared (modality-invariant) and
modality-specific components. Specifically, our approach firstly encodes and
aligns input modalities using pre-trained multi-modal encoders, then employs a
representation decomposition framework to separate common emotional content
from unique cues, and finally integrates these decomposed signals via an
attention mechanism to form a dynamic soft prompt for a multi-modal LLM.
Extensive experiments on three representative tasks for affective computing,
namely, multi-modal aspect-based sentiment analysis, multi-modal emotion
analysis, and hateful meme detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art
models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving
capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often
produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency
incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing
fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their
efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this
work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds
derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training
configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency
Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from
these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks
reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for
short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce
the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning
algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets.
Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL
approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of
token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our
efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off,
with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach,
REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching
Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy
loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token
budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to
perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and
difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating
multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure
and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a
novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel
agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and
inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a
formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief
propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence
scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final
answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith)
reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT,
Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing
interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a
promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM
reasoning. The implementation is available at

Abstract: This is the second in a series of short reports that seek to help business,

AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting, a technique that encourages a large language model (LLM) to
"think step by step" (Wei et al., 2022). CoT is a widely adopted method for
improving reasoning tasks, however, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture
of its effectiveness. We demonstrate two things:
  - The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting can vary greatly depending
on the type of task and model. For non-reasoning models, CoT generally improves
average performance by a small amount, particularly if the model does not
inherently engage in step-by-step processing by default. However, CoT can
introduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors
in questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many
recent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these
models, a request to perform CoT had little impact. Performing CoT generally
requires far more tokens (increasing cost and time) than direct answers.
  - For models designed with explicit reasoning capabilities, CoT prompting
often results in only marginal, if any, gains in answer accuracy. However, it
significantly increases the time and tokens needed to generate a response.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances model inference by increasing semantic coverage and improving sentiment prediction confidence.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) is an effective approach to addressing data
scarcity in low-resource scenarios. Recent existing research designs
hand-crafted prompts to guide LLM for data augmentation. We introduce a data
augmentation strategy for the aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) task
that preserves the original sentence semantics and has linguistic diversity,
specifically by providing a structured prompt template for an LLM to generate
predefined content. In addition, we employ a post-processing technique to
further ensure semantic consistency between the generated sentence and the
original sentence. The augmented data increases the semantic coverage of the
training distribution, enabling the model better to understand the relationship
between aspect categories and sentiment polarities, enhancing its inference
capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-weighted fine-tuning
strategy to encourage the model to generate more confident and accurate
sentiment polarity predictions. Compared with powerful and recent works, our
method consistently achieves the best performance on four benchmark datasets
over all baselines.

Abstract: Controlling the syntactic structure of text generated by language models is

that sampling algorithms based on the posterior inference can effectively
enforce a target constituency structure during generation. Our approach
combines sequential Monte Carlo, which estimates the posterior distribution by
sampling from a proposal distribution, with a syntactic tagger that ensures
that each generated token aligns with the desired syntactic structure. Our
experiments with GPT2 and Llama3-8B models show that with an appropriate
proposal distribution, we can improve syntactic accuracy, increasing the F1
score from $12.31$ (GPT2-large) and $35.33$ (Llama3-8B) to about $93$ in both
cases without compromising the language model's fluency. These results
underscore both the complexity of syntactic control and the effectiveness of
sampling algorithms, offering a promising approach for applications where
precise control over syntax is essential.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable

amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary
construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve
suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring
massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training
smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust
geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning
presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional
rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary
constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy
Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive
or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual
utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.
Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size
geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary
construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric
benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models
consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement
of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

is to reduce the training set size by removing noisy or redundant instances
while maintaining the effectiveness of the trained models and reducing the
training process cost. We provide a comprehensive and scientifically sound
comparison of IS methods applied to an essential NLP task -- Automatic Text
Classification (ATC), considering several classification solutions and many

solutions. We also propose two novel IS solutions that are noise-oriented and
redundancy-aware, specifically designed for large datasets and transformer
architectures. Our final solution achieved an average reduction of 41\% in
training sets, while maintaining the same levels of effectiveness in all
datasets. Importantly, our solutions demonstrated speedup improvements of 1.67x

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive,
uncurated corpora has raised growing concerns about the inclusion of sensitive,
copyrighted, or illegal content. This has led to increasing interest in LLM
unlearning: the task of selectively removing specific information from a model
without retraining from scratch or degrading overall utility. However, existing
methods often rely on large-scale forget and retain datasets, and suffer from
unnatural responses, poor generalization, or catastrophic utility loss. In this
work, we propose Reinforcement UnLearning (RULE), an efficient framework that
formulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem. RULE is
trained with a small portion of the forget set and synthesized boundary
queries, using a verifiable reward function that encourages safe refusal on
forget--related queries while preserving helpful responses on permissible
inputs. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating the
effectiveness of RULE in achieving targeted unlearning without compromising
model utility. Experimental results show that, with only $12%$ forget set and
$8%$ synthesized boundary data, RULE outperforms existing baselines by up to
$17.5%$ forget quality and $16.3%$ naturalness response while maintaining
general utility, achieving forget--retain Pareto optimality. Remarkably, we
further observe that RULE improves the naturalness of model outputs, enhances
training efficiency, and exhibits strong generalization ability, generalizing
refusal behavior to semantically related but unseen queries.

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated

ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance.
However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even
when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in
such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific
manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of
systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs
respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE
(Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated
benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art
Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on
sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across
multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore
key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy,
which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task. However, prior approaches
typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at
inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the
database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed,
human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To
address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large
language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during
inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which
allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and
iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL
operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as
in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in
execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing
a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling. Moreover, with SFT, the
performance of SDE-SQL can be further enhanced, yielding an additional 0.52%

Abstract: Long document classification poses challenges due to the computational
limitations of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, which are
constrained by fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity.
Moreover, using the full document for classification is often redundant, as
only a subset of sentences typically carries the necessary information. To
address this, we propose a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method that improves
efficiency by selecting the most informative content. Our approach explores
fixed-count and percentage-based sentence selection, along with an enhanced
scoring strategy combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length.
Evaluated on the MahaNews LDC dataset of long Marathi news articles, the method
consistently outperforms baselines such as first, last, and random sentence
selection. With MahaBERT-v2, we achieve near-identical classification accuracy
with just a 0.33 percent drop compared to the full-context baseline, while
reducing input size by over 50 percent and inference latency by 43 percent.
This demonstrates that significant context reduction is possible without
sacrificing performance, making the method practical for real-world long
document classification tasks.

Abstract: Emerging research on bias attribution and interpretability have revealed how
tokens contribute to biased behavior in language models processing English
texts. We build on this line of inquiry by adapting the information-theoretic
bias attribution score metric for implementation on models handling
agglutinative languages, particularly Filipino. We then demonstrate the
effectiveness of our adapted method by using it on a purely Filipino model and
on three multilingual models: one trained on languages worldwide and two on
Southeast Asian data. Our results show that Filipino models are driven towards
bias by words pertaining to people, objects, and relationships, entity-based
themes that stand in contrast to the action-heavy nature of bias-contributing
themes in English (i.e., criminal, sexual, and prosocial behaviors). These
findings point to differences in how English and non-English models process
inputs linked to sociodemographic groups and bias.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question
answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However,
their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data,
while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge
typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning
(ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of
modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs
perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect
evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a
player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new
benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical
Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news
articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be
misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these
issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a
structured, external memory from source documents without requiring
re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve
and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time.
Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both
benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or
integration of conflicting facts.

Abstract: Code-switching presents a complex challenge for syntactic analysis,
especially in low-resource language settings where annotated data is scarce.
While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for
sequence-level tagging, few approaches systematically investigate how well
these models capture syntactic structure in code-switched contexts. Moreover,
existing parsers trained on monolingual treebanks often fail to generalize to
multilingual and mixed-language input. To address this gap, we introduce the
BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based annotation pipeline designed to produce Universal
Dependencies (UD) annotations for code-switched text. First, we develop a
prompt-based framework for Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i data,
combining few-shot LLM prompting with expert review. Second, we release two
annotated datasets, including the first Spanish-Guaran\'i UD-parsed corpus.
Third, we conduct a detailed syntactic analysis of switch points across
language pairs and communicative contexts. Experimental results show that
BiLingua Parser achieves up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, significantly
outperforming prior baselines and multilingual parsers. These results show that
LLMs, when carefully guided, can serve as practical tools for bootstrapping
syntactic resources in under-resourced, code-switched environments. Data and

Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) presents a diversity of community needs

and focus groups, which tend to rely on small samples of respondents, we
propose an observational study on actual usage patterns of tetun$.$org, a
specialized MT service for the Tetun language, which is the lingua franca in
Timor-Leste. Our analysis of 100,000 translation requests reveals patterns that
challenge assumptions based on existing corpora. We find that users, many of
them students on mobile devices, typically translate text from a high-resource
language into Tetun across diverse domains including science, healthcare, and
daily life. This contrasts sharply with available Tetun corpora, which are
dominated by news articles covering government and social issues. Our results
suggest that MT systems for institutionalized minority languages like Tetun
should prioritize accuracy on domains relevant to educational contexts, in the
high-resource to low-resource direction. More broadly, this study demonstrates
how observational analysis can inform low-resource language technology
development, by grounding research in practical community needs.

Abstract: The sampling temperature, a critical hyperparameter in large language models
(LLMs), modifies the logits before the softmax layer, thereby reshaping the
distribution of output tokens. Recent studies have challenged the Stochastic
Parrots analogy by demonstrating that LLMs are capable of understanding
semantics rather than merely memorizing data and that randomness, modulated by
sampling temperature, plays a crucial role in model inference. In this study,
we systematically evaluated the impact of temperature in the range of 0 to 2 on
data sets designed to assess six different capabilities, conducting statistical
analyses on open source models of three different sizes: small (1B--4B), medium
(6B--13B), and large (40B--80B). Our findings reveal distinct skill-specific
effects of temperature on model performance, highlighting the complexity of
optimal temperature selection in practical applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a BERT-based temperature selector that takes advantage of
these observed effects to identify the optimal temperature for a given prompt.
We demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the performance of
small and medium models in the SuperGLUE datasets. Furthermore, our study
extends to FP16 precision inference, revealing that temperature effects are
consistent with those observed in 4-bit quantized models. By evaluating
temperature effects up to 4.0 in three quantized models, we find that the
Mutation Temperature -- the point at which significant performance changes
occur -- increases with model size.

Abstract: Bridging refers to the associative relationship between inferable entities in
a discourse and the antecedents which allow us to understand them, such as
understanding what "the door" means with respect to an aforementioned "house".
As identifying associative relations between entities is an inherently
subjective task, it is difficult to achieve consistent agreement in the
annotation of bridging anaphora and their antecedents. In this paper, we
explore the subjectivity involved in the annotation of bridging instances at
three levels: anaphor recognition, antecedent resolution, and bridging subtype
selection. To do this, we conduct an annotation pilot on the test set of the
existing GUM corpus, and propose a newly developed classification system for
bridging subtypes, which we compare to previously proposed schemes. Our results
suggest that some previous resources are likely to be severely under-annotated.
We also find that while agreement on the bridging subtype category was
moderate, annotator overlap for exhaustively identifying instances of bridging
is low, and that many disagreements resulted from subjective understanding of
the entities involved.

Abstract: Can we teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to refrain from hallucinating
factual statements? In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we
call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across
multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a
question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is
trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the
training highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt "answer only
if you are confident" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which
hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual
statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs
calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and
question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge
framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural
knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA's
confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while
reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.

Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a crucial component in aligning large language
models with human values. Significant attention has focused on using reward
models as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models
themselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning
prompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We
present a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive
analysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining
how different reward models score every possible single-token response to
value-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial
heterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic
asymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant
sensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)
overvaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten
recent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.
Our results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward
models, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and
context-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning
biases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended
consequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating
through the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.

Abstract: Role-playing has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
methods primarily rely on prompt engineering, which often lacks stability and
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing
Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal
model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts
latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant
features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that
can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity.
Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers
insights into how role information influences internal model activations.
Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes
demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves
from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to
45.10%. These results highlight the potential of SRPS to enhance reasoning
ability in LLMs, providing better interpretability and stability compared to
traditional prompt-based role-playing.

Abstract: Recently, major AI service providers such as Google and OpenAI have
introduced Finetuning-as-a-Service, which enables users to customize Large
Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks using their own data.
However, this service is vulnerable to degradation of LLM safety-alignment when
user data contains harmful prompts. While some prior works address this issue,
fundamentally filtering harmful data from user data remains unexplored.
Motivated by our observation that a directional representation reflecting
refusal behavior (called the refusal feature) obtained from safety-aligned LLMs
can inherently distinguish between harmful and harmless prompts, we propose the
Refusal-Feature-guided Teacher (ReFT). Our ReFT model is trained to identify
harmful prompts based on the similarity between input prompt features and its
refusal feature. During finetuning, the ReFT model serves as a teacher that
filters harmful prompts from user data and distills alignment knowledge into
the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReFT-based
finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances
finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for
secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in Finetuning-as-a-Service.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables non-experts to retrieve data from databases by converting
natural language queries into SQL. However, state-of-the-art text-to-SQL
studies rely on the BIRD dataset, which assumes that evidence is provided along
with questions. Although BIRD facilitates research advancements, it assumes
that users have expertise and domain knowledge, contradicting the fundamental
goal of text-to-SQL. In addition, human-generated evidence in BIRD contains
defects, including missing or erroneous evidence, which affects model
performance. To address this issue, we propose SEED (System for Evidence
Extraction and Domain knowledge generation), an approach that automatically
generates evidence to improve performance and practical usability in real-world
scenarios. SEED systematically analyzes database schema, description files, and
values to extract relevant information. We evaluated SEED on BIRD and Spider,
demonstrating that it significantly improves SQL generation accuracy in the
no-evidence scenario, and in some cases, even outperforms the setting where
BIRD evidence is provided. Our results highlight that SEED-generated evidence
not only bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment but also
improves the adaptability and robustness of text-to-SQL models. Our code is

Conclusion: PiFi effectively combines strengths of LLMs and SLMs without significant computational cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are renowned for their extensive linguistic
knowledge and strong generalization capabilities, but their high computational
demands make them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) are computationally efficient but often
lack the broad generalization capacity of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose
PiFi, a novel framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and SLMs to
achieve high performance while maintaining efficiency. PiFi integrates a single
frozen layer from an LLM into a SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for
specific tasks, boosting performance without a significant increase in
computational cost. We show that PiFi delivers consistent performance
improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks, including
both natural language understanding and generation. Moreover, our findings
demonstrate PiFi's ability to effectively leverage LLM knowledge, enhancing
generalization to unseen domains and facilitating the transfer of linguistic
abilities.

Abstract: Magri (2016) investigates two puzzles arising from conjunction. Although
Magri has proposed a solution to the second puzzle, the first remains
unresolved. This first puzzle reveals a hidden interaction among
quantification, collective/concurrent interpretation, and contextual updating
dimensions that have yet to be explored. In essence, the problem is that
certain forms of sentences like "Some Italians come from a warm country," when
conjoined as in "(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,"
sound infelicitous, even though no obvious alternative triggers a conflicting
scalar implicature. In this paper, we offer a conceptual analysis of Magri's
first puzzle by situating it within its original theoretical framework. We
argue that the oddness arises from the collective or concurrent reading of the
conjunctive predicate: in examples such as "(Only) Some Italians come from a
warm country and are blond," this interpretation generates an indirect
contextual contradiction. Moreover, we suggest that the pragmatic mechanisms
governing scalar implicature generation extend beyond what is captured by
exhaustification-based grammatical licensing accounts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require alignment with human preferences to

low-resource methods for LLM alignment have been popular, while still facing
challenges in obtaining both high-quality and aligned content. Motivated by the
observation that the difficulty of generating aligned responses is concentrated
at the beginning of decoding, we propose a novel framework, Weak-to-Strong
Decoding (WSD), to enhance the alignment ability of base models by the guidance
of a small aligned model. The small model first drafts well-aligned beginnings,
followed by the large base model to continue the rest, controlled by a
well-designed auto-switch mechanism. We also collect a new dataset, GenerAlign,
to fine-tune a small-sized Pilot-3B as the draft model, which effectively
enhances different base models under the WSD framework to outperform all
baseline methods, while avoiding degradation on downstream tasks, termed as the
alignment tax. Extensive experiments are further conducted to examine the
impact of different settings and time efficiency, as well as analyses on the
intrinsic mechanisms of WSD in depth.

approach combines in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive
hard-negative mining to generate context-aware embeddings without task-specific
fine-tuning. Structured instructions and few-shot examples are used to guide
the model across diverse tasks, enabling strong performance on classification,
semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking benchmarks. To improve semantic
discrimination, we employ a soft labeling framework where continuous relevance
scores, distilled from a high-performance dense retriever and reranker, serve
as fine-grained supervision signals. In addition, we introduce adaptive
margin-based hard-negative mining, which filters out semantically ambiguous
negatives based on their similarity to positive examples, thereby enhancing
training stability and retrieval robustness. Our model is evaluated on the
newly introduced MTEB (English, v2) benchmark, covering 41 tasks across seven
categories. Results show that our method achieves strong generalization and
ranks among the top-performing models by Borda score, outperforming several
larger or fully fine-tuned baselines. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topic models perform poorly in low-resource settings due to unstable and incoherent topic inference when there is limited target-domain data.

Method: The paper establishes a generalization bound and proposes DALTA, which uses a shared encoder for invariant features, specialized decoders for domain-specific aspects, and adversarial alignment to transfer relevant information from a high-resource source to a low-resource target domain.

Result: Experiments show DALTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in topic coherence, stability, and transferability across diverse low-resource datasets.

Conclusion: Effective knowledge transfer in domain adaptation for topic modeling requires robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space discrepancy, and avoiding overfitting, which DALTA achieves through its framework.

Abstract: Topic modeling plays a vital role in uncovering hidden semantic structures
within text corpora, but existing models struggle in low-resource settings
where limited target-domain data leads to unstable and incoherent topic
inference. We address this challenge by formally introducing domain adaptation
for low-resource topic modeling, where a high-resource source domain informs a
low-resource target domain without overwhelming it with irrelevant content. We
establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge
transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space
discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights,
we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that
employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders
for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer
relevant information. Experiments on diverse low-resource datasets demonstrate
that DALTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of topic
coherence, stability, and transferability.

Abstract: Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question
is challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior
under knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory
contradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully
reflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we
first introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency
and correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical
framework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about
knowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five
statuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically
establish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2)
Context features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive
successful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when
partially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong.
(4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with
enhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes
across LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly assisting users in the real
world, yet their reliability remains a concern. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
has been heralded as a tool to enhance human-LLM collaboration by enabling
users to know when to trust LLM predictions. We argue that current practices
for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are not optimal for developing useful UQ
for human users making decisions in real-world tasks. Through an analysis of 40
LLM UQ methods, we identify three prevalent practices hindering the community's
progress toward its goal of benefiting downstream users: 1) evaluating on
benchmarks with low ecological validity; 2) considering only epistemic
uncertainty; and 3) optimizing metrics that are not necessarily indicative of
downstream utility. For each issue, we propose concrete user-centric practices
and research directions that LLM UQ researchers should consider. Instead of
hill-climbing on unrepresentative tasks using imperfect metrics, we argue that
the community should adopt a more human-centered approach to LLM uncertainty
quantification.

Abstract: We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered

occupies roughly $35$ TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets:
CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a $5.2$ TB carefully
curated Chinese web corpus, a $22.5$ TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and
diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are
mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various
domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to
process. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based
on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and
domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract $4.5$ billion pieces of
CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the
distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction
exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the
possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs
pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals,
yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing
comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values,
which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization
system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead
customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in
MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness
focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of
summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose
FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and
corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to
generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level
fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting
the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms
strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries. The

TL;DR: GA LLM combines Genetic Algorithms and Large Language Models for structured generation under constraints, showing effectiveness in tasks like planning and reporting with improved quality and constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle structured generation tasks with strict constraints, leveraging both domain knowledge from LLMs and structural optimization from GAs.

Method: Treat each output as a gene, apply evolutionary operations (selection, crossover, mutation) guided by the language model to iteratively improve solutions.

Result: Effective in itinerary planning, academic outlining, business reporting, producing well-structured, requirement-satisfying results with modular adaptability.

Conclusion: GA LLM outperforms LLMs alone by combining their strengths, leading to better constraint satisfaction and higher quality solutions.

Abstract: GA LLM is a hybrid framework that combines Genetic Algorithms with Large
Language Models to handle structured generation tasks under strict constraints.
Each output, such as a plan or report, is treated as a gene, and evolutionary
operations like selection, crossover, and mutation are guided by the language
model to iteratively improve solutions. The language model provides domain
knowledge and creative variation, while the genetic algorithm ensures
structural integrity and global optimization. GA LLM has proven effective in
tasks such as itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting,
consistently producing well structured and requirement satisfying results. Its
modular design also makes it easy to adapt to new tasks. Compared to using a
language model alone, GA LLM achieves better constraint satisfaction and higher
quality solutions by combining the strengths of both components.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite extensive research on textual and visual disambiguation,
disambiguation through speech (DTS) remains underexplored. This is largely due
to the lack of high-quality datasets that pair spoken sentences with richly
ambiguous text. To address this gap, we present DEBATE, a unique public Chinese
speech-text dataset designed to study how speech cues and
patterns-pronunciation, pause, stress and intonation-can help resolve textual
ambiguity and reveal a speaker's true intent. DEBATE contains 1,001 carefully
selected ambiguous utterances, each recorded by 10 native speakers, capturing
diverse linguistic ambiguities and their disambiguation through speech. We
detail the data collection pipeline and provide rigorous quality analysis.
Additionally, we benchmark three state-of-the-art large speech and
audio-language models, illustrating clear and huge performance gaps between
machine and human understanding of spoken intent. DEBATE represents the first
effort of its kind and offers a foundation for building similar DTS datasets
across languages and cultures. The dataset and associated code are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the actual needs of native speakers in Indonesia for NLP development, as current efforts are costly and there's uncertainty about what the communities truly require.

Method: The method involves conducting a nationwide survey to assess the needs of native speakers in Indonesia.

Result: The result shows that language barriers are the most critical issue, with machine translation and information retrieval being the top priorities. Additionally, there are concerns about privacy, bias, and data transparency.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that while there's enthusiasm for language technology, addressing privacy, bias, and data transparency is essential for broader AI adoption in Indonesia.

Abstract: There is an emerging effort to develop NLP for Indonesias 700+ local
languages, but progress remains costly due to the need for direct engagement
with native speakers. However, it is unclear what these language communities
truly need from language technology. To address this, we conduct a nationwide
survey to assess the actual needs of native speakers in Indonesia. Our findings
indicate that addressing language barriers, particularly through machine
translation and information retrieval, is the most critical priority. Although
there is strong enthusiasm for advancements in language technology, concerns
around privacy, bias, and the use of public data for AI training highlight the
need for greater transparency and clear communication to support broader AI
adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy of named entity correction in ASR systems, which is crucial for applications requiring precise entity recognition.

Method: Extends RAGEC by incorporating synthetic denoising rationales, phonetic similarity, and augmented definitions for refining noisy NEs with in-context learning.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements in WER and NE hit ratio on CommonVoice and STOP datasets, with a 28% relative WER reduction compared to ASR without postprocessing.

Conclusion: DeRAGEC effectively improves NE correction in ASR systems without additional training, showing better performance than baseline methods and RAGEC.

Abstract: We present DeRAGEC, a method for improving Named Entity (NE) correction in
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. By extending the
Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction (RAGEC) framework, DeRAGEC
employs synthetic denoising rationales to filter out noisy NE candidates before
correction. By leveraging phonetic similarity and augmented definitions, it
refines noisy retrieved NEs using in-context learning, requiring no additional
training. Experimental results on CommonVoice and STOP datasets show
significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) and NE hit ratio,
outperforming baseline ASR and RAGEC methods. Specifically, we achieved a 28%
relative reduction in WER compared to ASR without postprocessing. Our source

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability:
just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc
explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by
mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this
inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high
cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small
datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank
(PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and
models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature
importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely
differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the
standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more
effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune
LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better
alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under
domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy,
self-consistent LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Byte-level fallbacks for subword tokenization have become a common practice
in large language models. In particular, it has been demonstrated to be
incredibly effective as a pragmatic solution for preventing OOV, especially in
the context of larger models. However, breaking a character down to individual
bytes significantly increases the sequence length for long-tail tokens in
languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) and other
character-diverse contexts such as emoji. The increased sequence length results
in longer computation during both training and inference. In this work, we
propose a simple compression technique that reduces the sequence length
losslessly.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of applications, their performance often degrades in complex reasoning
tasks. In this work, we introduce SELT (Self-Evaluation LLM Tree Search), a
novel framework that leverages a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
enhance LLM reasoning without relying on external reward models. By redefining
the Upper Confidence Bound scoring to align with intrinsic self-evaluation
capabilities of LLMs and decomposing the inference process into atomic subtasks
augmented with semantic clustering at each node, SELT effectively balances
exploration and exploitation, reduces redundant reasoning paths, and mitigates
hallucination. We validate our approach on challenging benchmarks, including
the knowledge-based MMLU and the Tool Learning dataset Seal-Tools, where SELT
achieves significant improvements in answer accuracy and reasoning robustness
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our framework operates without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse
reasoning tasks. Relevant results and code are available at

Result: Commercial LLMs like ChatGPT and Tower LLM show better performance than open-source models like Llama and Bloom. Prompt-based approaches are effective for translation quality assessment.

Conclusion: The paper suggests future research directions in context-aware machine translation with LLMs, emphasizing the potential of commercial models and prompt-based methods.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the large language models (LLMs), their application

Abstract: Instructing language models with user intent requires large instruction
datasets, which are only available for a limited set of languages. In this
paper, we explore alternatives to conventional instruction adaptation pipelines
in low-resource scenarios. We assume a realistic scenario for low-resource
languages, where only the following are available: corpora in the target
language, existing open-weight multilingual base and instructed backbone LLMs,
and synthetically generated instructions sampled from the instructed backbone.
We present a comprehensive set of experiments for Basque that systematically
study different combinations of these components evaluated on benchmarks and
human preferences from 1,680 participants. Our conclusions show that target
language corpora are essential, with synthetic instructions yielding robust
models, and, most importantly, that using as backbone an instruction-tuned
model outperforms using a base non-instructed model, and improved results when
scaling up. Using Llama 3.1 instruct 70B as backbone our model comes near
frontier models of much larger sizes for Basque, without using any Basque data
apart from the 1.2B word corpora. We release code, models, instruction
datasets, and human preferences to support full reproducibility in future
research on low-resource language adaptation.

Abstract: Stance detection identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a specific

primarily on tweet-level stances from established platforms, user-level stance
resources, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky remain scarce.
User-level stance detection provides a more holistic view by considering a
user's complete posting history rather than isolated posts. We present the
first stance detection dataset for the 2024 U.S. presidential election,
collected from Bluesky and centered on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The
dataset comprises 16,044 user-target stance pairs enriched with engagement
metadata, interaction graphs, and user posting histories. PolitiSky24 was
created using a carefully evaluated pipeline combining advanced information
retrieval and large language models, which generates stance labels with
supporting rationales and text spans for transparency. The labeling approach
achieves 81\% accuracy with scalable LLMs. This resource addresses gaps in
political stance analysis through its timeliness, open-data nature, and
user-level perspective. The dataset is available at

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the first effort to adapt large language models

morphologically complex dialect spoken in the Carpathian Highlands. We created
a parallel corpus of 9852 dialect-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and a

proposing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate
synthetic parallel translation pairs, expanding the corpus with 52142 examples.
We have fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs using LoRA and evaluated them on a
standard-to-dialect translation task, also comparing with few-shot GPT-4o
translation. In the absence of human annotators, we adopt a multi-metric
evaluation strategy combining BLEU, chrF++, TER, and LLM-based judgment
(GPT-4o). The results show that even small(7B) finetuned models outperform
zero-shot baselines such as GPT-4o across both automatic and LLM-evaluated

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown remarkable capabilities in the NLP domain.
Their effectiveness can mainly be attributed to their ability to adapt to an
array of downstream tasks. However, generally, full fine-tuning is a
computationally expensive job. To mitigate this, many techniques have been
developed that prime efficiency, a prominent one being Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). However, LoRA and its variants employ re-parametrized additive updates.
In this paper, we propose Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), which
shifts the paradigm of additive updates to a richer space of matrix
multiplicative transformations. We tackle challenges such as computational
complexity and rank bottleneck of matrix multiplication by effectively
re-ordering operations and introducing rank inflation strategies. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms
of various evaluation metrics.

Motivation: Current LLMs lack alignment with pedagogical strategies without task-specific adaptation, which is crucial for effective tutoring in intelligent systems.

Method: The study uses MathDial dataset, applies automated annotation with an 11-intent taxonomy, fine-tunes an LLM, and compares it with models using a 4-category taxonomy.

Result: The fine-grained model produced more pedagogically aligned and effective responses according to automatic and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Intent specificity enhances controlled text generation in education, and the annotated data/code are released for further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for educational applications,
particularly in intelligent tutoring systems. However, effective tutoring
requires alignment with pedagogical strategies - something current LLMs lack
without task-specific adaptation. In this work, we explore whether fine-grained
annotation of teacher intents can improve the quality of LLM-generated tutoring
responses. We focus on MathDial, a dialog dataset for math instruction, and
apply an automated annotation framework to re-annotate a portion of the dataset
using a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents. We then fine-tune an
LLM using these new annotations and compare its performance to models trained
on the original four-category taxonomy. Both automatic and qualitative
evaluations show that the fine-grained model produces more pedagogically
aligned and effective responses. Our findings highlight the value of intent
specificity for controlled text generation in educational settings, and we
release our annotated data and code to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate highly detailed,

DOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100

sentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight
three key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization,
validated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and
strong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven
AutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent
alignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An
innovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide
LLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality
(e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark

incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by
generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their
susceptibility to jailbreaks and perturbations necessitates additional
evaluations. Many LLMs are multilingual, but safety-related training data
contains mainly high-resource languages like English. This can leave them
vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages such as Polish. We show
how surprisingly strong attacks can be cheaply created by altering just a few
characters and using a small proxy model for word importance calculation. We
find that these character and word-level attacks drastically alter the
predictions of different LLMs, suggesting a potential vulnerability that can be
used to circumvent their internal safety mechanisms. We validate our attack
construction methodology on Polish, a low-resource language, and find potential
vulnerabilities of LLMs in this language. Additionally, we show how it can be
extended to other languages. We release the created datasets and code for
further research.

Motivation: The motivation is to create high-quality Japanese TTS datasets by improving the accuracy of phonemic and prosodic annotations through a hybrid approach combining ASR models and prior knowledge.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning a pre-trained ASR model with ground truth transcripts to output graphemes and annotations, and using a decoding strategy with dictionary prior knowledge to correct phonemic errors.

Result: Objective evaluation shows the method outperforms previous text or audio-only approaches; subjective evaluation shows synthesized speech naturalness is comparable to manual annotations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed method effectively enhances annotation accuracy for Japanese TTS datasets, offering a reliable alternative to manual processes with improved efficiency and quality.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for annotating phonemic and prosodic
labels on a given audio-transcript pair, aimed at constructing Japanese
text-to-speech (TTS) datasets. Our approach involves fine-tuning a large-scale
pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, conditioned on ground
truth transcripts, to simultaneously output phrase-level graphemes and
annotation labels. To further correct errors in phonemic labeling, we employ a
decoding strategy that utilizes dictionary prior knowledge. The objective
evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous
approaches relying solely on text or audio. The subjective evaluation results
indicate that the naturalness of speech synthesized by the TTS model, trained
with labels annotated using our method, is comparable to that of a model
trained with manual annotations.

Abstract: The paper addresses two critical challenges in language model (LM)
evaluation: creating reliable domain-specific benchmarks and understanding
knowledge representation during domain adaptation. We introduce a deterministic
pipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks
without relying on LMs or human curation, eliminating benchmark contamination
issues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. Our approach
generates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term
TF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by
measuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct
domain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with
low computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple
models (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we
demonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated
benchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than
traditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens
rapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to
domain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.
By extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that
initial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while
later layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during
adaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction
happens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical
evaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into
knowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more
efficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning is difficult for LLMs because of complex logic and precise computation needs. Current methods for enhancing reasoning through dataset synthesis have issues with generation quality and problem complexity.

Method: The authors extract structural information from generated problem-solving code and use it to guide data generation, creating a more structured and challenging dataset.

Result: The approach generated 39K problems with labeled intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark of higher difficulty. Model performance decreased with longer reasoning steps, and fine-tuning experiments showed the dataset's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method and dataset are expected to contribute to future research in improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs due to complex logic and

Applied to MATH and GSM8K, our approach produces 39K problems with labeled

increases. Additionally, we conducted fine-tuning experiments using the
proposed training data on a range of LLMs, and the results validate the
effectiveness of our dataset. We hope the proposed method and dataset will
contribute to future research in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to
automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement($\textit{e.g.}$, users
commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures
on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence,
relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this
paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool
($\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful
content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test
beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over
$107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s
accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism,
ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful
messages, up to $94\%$ on some datasets, $\textit{bypass moderation}$.
Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\%$ removal,
revealing $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We
also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\texttt{AutoMod}$
blocks up to $89.5\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in
pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in
$\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such
systems to understand context effectively.

Abstract: We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers
and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation
of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers.
Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and
topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private
document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it
an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant
information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response
when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise
rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant
passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b)
deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true
positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at
most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering
time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private
grounding sources.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and capability, understanding
their internal mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) have emerged as a key tool in mechanistic interpretability, enabling the
extraction of human-interpretable features from LLMs. However, existing SAE
training methods are primarily designed for base models, resulting in reduced
reconstruction quality and interpretability when applied to instruct models. To
bridge this gap, we propose
$\underline{\textbf{F}}$inetuning-$\underline{\textbf{a}}$ligned
$\underline{\textbf{S}}$equential $\underline{\textbf{T}}$raining
($\textit{FAST}$), a novel training method specifically tailored for instruct
models. $\textit{FAST}$ aligns the training process with the data distribution
and activation patterns characteristic of instruct models, resulting in
substantial improvements in both reconstruction and feature interpretability.
On Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, $\textit{FAST}$ achieves a mean squared error of 0.6468
in token reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline methods with
errors of 5.1985 and 1.5096. In feature interpretability, $\textit{FAST}$
yields a higher proportion of high-quality features, for Llama3.2-3B-Instruct,
$21.1\%$ scored in the top range, compared to $7.0\%$ and $10.2\%$ for
$\textit{BT(P)}$ and $\textit{BT(F)}$. Surprisingly, we discover that
intervening on the activations of special tokens via the SAEs leads to
improvements in output quality, suggesting new opportunities for fine-grained
control of model behavior. Code, data, and 240 trained SAEs are available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has become a common strategy to
enhance reasoning in language models. While effective for large models, we
identify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language
models (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience
significant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the
Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is
widespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT
examples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.
Strikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even
training on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original
performance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error
accumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step
reasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we
find that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement
learning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our findings challenge common assumptions about
the benefits of long CoT training for SLMs and offer practical guidance for
building more effective small-scale reasoning models.

Motivation: Existing GEC frameworks like errant have limitations when applied to typologically diverse languages, necessitating a standardized and flexible approach for consistent annotation and evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances multilingual GEC annotation by providing consistency and flexibility, enabling broader language coverage and more reliable evaluation across different languages.

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) relies on accurate error annotation and
evaluation, yet existing frameworks, such as $\texttt{errant}$, face
limitations when extended to typologically diverse languages. In this paper, we
introduce a standardized, modular framework for multilingual grammatical error
annotation. Our approach combines a language-agnostic foundation with
structured language-specific extensions, enabling both consistency and

Abstract: This paper presents a new long-form release of the Swiss Parliaments Corpus,
converting entire multi-hour Swiss German debate sessions (each aligned with
the official session protocols) into high-quality speech-text pairs. Our
pipeline starts by transcribing all session audio into Standard German using
Whisper Large-v3 under high-compute settings. We then apply a two-step GPT-4o
correction process: first, GPT-4o ingests the raw Whisper output alongside the
official protocols to refine misrecognitions, mainly named entities. Second, a
separate GPT-4o pass evaluates each refined segment for semantic completeness.
We filter out any segments whose Predicted BLEU score (derived from Whisper's
average token log-probability) and GPT-4o evaluation score fall below a certain
threshold. The final corpus contains 801 hours of audio, of which 751 hours
pass our quality control. Compared to the original sentence-level SPC release,
our long-form dataset achieves a 6-point BLEU improvement, demonstrating the
power of combining robust ASR, LLM-based correction, and data-driven filtering
for low-resource, domain-specific speech corpora.

TL;DR: This paper discusses a method called AbstraL that uses reinforcement learning to improve the abstract reasoning of large language models, making them more robust against distribution shifts and better connected to symbolic tools for problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of robustness in LLMs, particularly smaller ones, when they encounter distribution shifts like changes in numerical/nominal variables or distracting clauses, which causes performance drops.

Method: The method involves abstracting reasoning problems instead of generating synthetic data. It uses reinforcement learning (RL) on granular abstraction data to acquire better abstraction, as opposed to supervised fine-tuning which fails to produce faithful abstractions.

Result: AbstraL significantly reduces performance degradation on recent GSM perturbation benchmarks compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that abstraction through RL is more effective than supervised fine-tuning for improving LLMs' robustness and their ability to connect with symbolic tools for solving problems.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially
smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to
experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as
changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting
clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data
to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In
contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not
only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection
to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process
is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised
fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method,
AbstraL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular
abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent
GSM perturbation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to erase or suppress undesirable
knowledge within the model, offering promise for controlling harmful or private
information to prevent misuse. However, recent studies highlight its limited
efficacy in real-world scenarios, hindering practical adoption. In this study,
we identify a pervasive issue underlying many downstream failures: the
effectiveness of existing unlearning methods heavily depends on the form of
training samples and frequently fails to generalize to alternate expressions of
the same knowledge. We formally characterize this problem as Form-Dependent
Bias and systematically investigate its specific manifestation patterns across
various downstream tasks. To quantify its prevalence and support future
research, we introduce ORT, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of unlearning methods against variations in knowledge expression.
Results reveal that Form-Dependent Bias is both widespread and severe among
current techniques.
  We argue that LLM unlearning should be form-independent to address the
endless forms of downstream tasks encountered in real-world security-critical
scenarios. Towards this goal, we introduce Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR),
a novel training-free method, as a promising solution path. ROCR performs
unlearning by targeting the invariants in downstream tasks, specifically the
activated dangerous concepts. It is capable of modifying model parameters
within seconds to redirect the model's perception of a specific unlearning
target concept to another harmless concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ROCR significantly improves unlearning effectiveness compared to
traditional methods while generating highly natural outputs.

Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm
combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with

pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them
according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module
enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from
Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average
Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that
improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, achieving
state-of-the-art results on 9 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language
processing datasets and ranking first according to the Friedman test among 19
methods. Furthermore, MultiMatch demonstrates exceptional robustness in highly
imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best approach by 3.26% -- and
data imbalance is a key factor for many text classification tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Generative AI technology, Multimodal Large

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
contextual understanding. However, their ability to attend to truly critical
information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the
pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting
patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing
these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation
quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training
data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal
instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant
reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead
and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To
mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus
(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding
factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an
advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal
relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes
these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's
attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context
tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an
absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens
during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates
to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models
efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous
information - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model
editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to
scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework
that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter
module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By
sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines
each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing
interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by
comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during
editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only
the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for
unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction,
and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks across LLaMA-3 and Mistral
demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across
reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of
sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

Abstract: This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)

systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training
data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of
model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention
mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context

accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,
a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable
satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training
tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient
pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by
introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and
data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose
CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative
sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse
on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B
parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4
outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks,
highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B
demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient

structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a
hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention
mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling.
The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while
significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical
attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification
benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or
comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP)
models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When
compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average
accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic
datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring
nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp
dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques
for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Consider the problem of testing whether the outputs of a large language model
(LLM) system change under an arbitrary intervention, such as an input
perturbation or changing the model variant. We cannot simply compare two LLM
outputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor
can we compare the entire output distribution due to computational
intractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist,
they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or
fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a
framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist
hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output
distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte
Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional
assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation
of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields
interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled
error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can
quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate
alignment with reference models. Above all, we see this as a reliable
frequentist hypothesis testing framework for LLM auditing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modern language models represent probability distributions over character
strings as distributions over (shorter) token strings derived via a
deterministic tokenizer, such as byte-pair encoding. While this approach is
highly effective at scaling up language models to large corpora, its current
incarnations have a concerning property: the model assigns nonzero probability
mass to an exponential number of $\it{noncanonical}$ token encodings of each
character string -- these are token strings that decode to valid character
strings but are impossible under the deterministic tokenizer (i.e., they will
never be seen in any training corpus, no matter how large). This misallocation
is both erroneous, as noncanonical strings never appear in training data, and
wasteful, diverting probability mass away from plausible outputs. These are
avoidable mistakes! In this work, we propose methods to enforce canonicality in
token-level language models, ensuring that only canonical token strings are
assigned positive probability. We present two approaches: (1) canonicality by
conditioning, leveraging test-time inference strategies without additional
training, and (2) canonicality by construction, a model parameterization that
guarantees canonical outputs but requires training. We demonstrate that fixing
canonicality mistakes improves the likelihood of held-out data for several
models and corpora.

one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60% of the time when both models err. We
identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and
providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly
correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers. Finally, we
show the effects of correlation in two downstream tasks: LLM-as-judge
evaluation and hiring -- the latter reflecting theoretical predictions

Motivation: The motivation is to create a scalable method for general-purpose reinforcement learning that doesn't rely on domain-specific annotated answers, instead using vast text data to improve language modeling accuracy.

Method: The method involves reframing next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained with reinforcement learning, using verifiable rewards for correct predictions.

Result: The results show that RPT improves next-token prediction accuracy and provides a strong pre-trained foundation for reinforcement fine-tuning, with scaling curves indicating that more training compute leads to better accuracy.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that RPT is an effective and promising scaling paradigm for advancing language model pre-training.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) as a new scaling

Specifically, we reframe next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained

next token for a given context. RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast
amounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on
domain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of
next-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy
of predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained
foundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that
increased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction
accuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling
paradigm to advance language model pre-training.

### [404] [Private GPTs for LLM-driven testing in software development and machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06509)
*Jakub Jagielski,Markus Abel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies how well private GPTs can generate executable test code from acceptance criteria, finding that using Gherkin syntax as an intermediate step produces better tests in terms of readability and coding practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable product owners and business intelligence teams to directly create testable criteria using LLMs, improving the efficiency and quality of test code generation.

Method: The method involves evaluating the quality of test code generated by LLMs in two ways: directly from requirements and via an intermediate Gherkin syntax step.

Result: The two-step procedure using Gherkin syntax resulted in better test code regarding human readability, lines of code, and use of testing libraries.

Conclusion: Structured prompts enhance the quality of test outputs, suggesting that incorporating Gherkin syntax as an intermediary can improve test code generation with LLMs.

Abstract: In this contribution, we examine the capability of private GPTs to
automatically generate executable test code based on requirements. More
specifically, we use acceptance criteria as input, formulated as part of epics,
or stories, which are typically used in modern development processes. This
gives product owners, or business intelligence, respectively, a way to directly
produce testable criteria through the use of LLMs. We explore the quality of
the so-produced tests in two ways: i) directly by letting the LLM generate code
from requirements, ii) through an intermediate step using Gherkin syntax. As a
result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better results -where
we define better in terms of human readability and best coding practices, i.e.
lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in testing.
Concretely, we evaluate prompt effectiveness across two scenarios: a simple
"Hello World" program and a digit classification model, showing that structured
prompts lead to higher-quality test outputs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As quantum computing advances, quantum programming libraries' heterogeneity
and steady evolution create new challenges for software developers. Frequent
updates in software libraries break working code that needs to be refactored,
thus adding complexity to an already complex landscape. These refactoring
challenges are, in many cases, fundamentally different from those known in
classical software engineering due to the nature of quantum computing software.
This study addresses these challenges by developing a taxonomy of quantum
circuit's refactoring problems, providing a structured framework to analyze and
compare different refactoring approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
proven valuable tools for classic software development, yet their value in
quantum software engineering remains unexplored. This study uses LLMs to
categorize refactoring needs in migration scenarios between different Qiskit
versions. Qiskit documentation and release notes were scrutinized to create an
initial taxonomy of refactoring required for migrating between Qiskit releases.
Two taxonomies were produced: one by expert developers and one by an LLM. These
taxonomies were compared, analyzing differences and similarities, and were
integrated into a unified taxonomy that reflects the findings of both methods.
By systematically categorizing refactoring challenges in Qiskit, the unified
taxonomy is a foundation for future research on AI-assisted migration while
enabling a more rigorous evaluation of automated refactoring techniques.
Additionally, this work contributes to quantum software engineering (QSE) by
enhancing software development workflows, improving language compatibility, and
promoting best practices in quantum programming.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to automate real-world tasks by invoking
APIs through natural language instructions. While powerful, they often suffer
from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that
diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve.
Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in
handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce IntenTest, an
API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent
integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed
benchmarks or adversarial inputs, IntenTest generates realistic tasks based on
toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent
errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic
partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories
based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each
partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that
estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency,
IntenTest maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts
effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs
demonstrate that IntenTest effectively uncovers intent integrity violations,
significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query
efficiency. Moreover, IntenTest generalizes well to stronger target models
using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across
domains.

*Tzu-wen Hsu,Ke-Han Lu,Cheng-Han Chiang,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), an inference-time strategy to reduce hallucinations in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) by comparing token predictions with and without audio context using contrastive decoding, leading to improved performance on object hallucination and general audio QA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of hallucinations in LALMs when processing audio and text inputs, which can lead to incorrect or fabricated answers about the audio content.

Method: The method involves Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare token prediction logits with and without audio context, promoting tokens with increased probability when audio is present.

Result: AAD improves F1 scores on object hallucination datasets by 0.046 to 0.428 and enhances accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that AAD effectively mitigates hallucinations in LALMs, demonstrating significant improvements in performance across different audio QA datasets through systematic ablation studies.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can take audio and text as the inputs and
answer questions about the audio. While prior LALMs have shown strong
performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs
can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination
of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time
strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits
with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the
tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our
experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD
improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the
accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We
conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each
component in AAD.

Motivation: To address the limitations of SOT in multi-talker ASR, particularly speaker assignment failures, and the challenges in extracting auxiliary information like timestamps from natural speech.

Method: Proposed Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC) which jointly assigns tokens and speaker labels per frame, integrated into SOT framework for multi-task learning.

Result: Multi-task learning with SD-CTC and SOT reduces SOT error rate by 26% and matches state-of-the-art methods using auxiliary info.

Conclusion: SD-CTC enhances SOT by enabling speaker distinction with just speech and transcriptions, eliminating reliance on auxiliary data.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for multi-talker automatic speech
recognition without the need for auxiliary information. Serialized Output
Training (SOT), a widely used approach, suffers from recognition errors due to
speaker assignment failures. Although incorporating auxiliary information, such
as token-level timestamps, can improve recognition accuracy, extracting such
information from natural conversational speech remains challenging. To address
this limitation, we propose Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), an extension
of CTC that jointly assigns a token and its corresponding speaker label to each
frame. We further integrate SD-CTC into the SOT framework, enabling the SOT
model to learn speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and
transcriptions. Experimental comparisons show that multi-task learning with
SD-CTC and SOT reduces the error rate of the SOT model by 26% and achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods relying on auxiliary
information.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Audio bandwidth extension is the task of reconstructing missing high
frequency components of bandwidth-limited audio signals, where bandwidth
limitation is a common issue for audio signals due to several reasons,
including channel capacity and data constraints. While conventional spectral
band replication is a well-established parametric approach to audio bandwidth
extension, the SBR usually entails coarse feature extraction and reconstruction
techniques, which leads to limitations when processing various types of audio
signals. In parallel, numerous deep neural network-based audio bandwidth
extension methods have been proposed. These DNN-based methods are usually
referred to as blind BWE, as these methods do not rely on prior information
extracted from original signals, and only utilize given low frequency band
signals to estimate missing high frequency components. In order to replace
conventional SBR with DNNs, simply adopting existing DNN-based methodologies
results in suboptimal performance due to the blindness of these methods. My
proposed research suggests a new approach to parametric non-blind bandwidth
extension, as DNN-based side information extraction and DNN-based bandwidth
extension are performed only at the front and end of the audio coding pipeline.

*Bastian Jäckl,Vojtěch Kloda,Daniel A. Keim,Jakub Lokoč*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper explores using location-based prompts with CLIP to improve image retrieval in homogeneous underwater scenes where text queries are vague.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that existing multimodal models perform well on everyday scenes but struggle with specialized, homogeneous domains like underwater environments, where users can't provide precise text descriptions.

Method: The method involves collecting a dataset with 741 human annotations, including short/long text descriptions and bounding boxes for underwater scenes, then evaluating CLIP's performance on sub-regions versus full images.

Result: Results show that 3x3 partitioning and 5-grid overlap of images significantly improve retrieval effectiveness and are robust to annotation box perturbations.

Conclusion: Adding location-based prompts to text queries enhances retrieval in challenging, homogeneous domains like underwater scenes, suggesting potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Advances in multimodal text-image models have enabled effective text-based
querying in extensive image collections. While these models show convincing
performance for everyday life scenes, querying in highly homogeneous,
specialized domains remains challenging. The primary problem is that users can
often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to
discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding
location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance
retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human
annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding
boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using
these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various
static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that
both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve
retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation
box.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: ISO 639:2023 unifies the ISO language-code family and introduces contextual
metadata, but it lacks a machine-native mechanism for handling dialectal drift
and creole mixtures. We propose a formalisation of recursive semantic
anchoring, attaching to every language entity $\chi$ a family of fixed-point
operators $\phi_{n,m}$ that model bounded semantic drift via the relation
$\phi_{n,m}(\chi) = \chi \oplus \Delta(\chi)$, where $\Delta(\chi)$ is a drift
vector in a latent semantic manifold. The base anchor $\phi_{0,0}$ recovers the
canonical ISO 639:2023 identity, whereas $\phi_{99,9}$ marks the maximal drift
state that triggers a deterministic fallback. Using category theory, we treat
the operators $\phi_{n,m}$ as morphisms and drift vectors as arrows in a
category $\mathrm{DriftLang}$. A functor $\Phi: \mathrm{DriftLang} \to
\mathrm{AnchorLang}$ maps every drifted object to its unique anchor and proves
convergence. We provide an RDF/Turtle schema (\texttt{BaseLanguage},
\texttt{DriftedLanguage}, \texttt{ResolvedAnchor}) and worked examples -- e.g.,
$\phi_{8,4}$ (Standard Mandarin) versus $\phi_{8,7}$ (a colloquial variant),
and $\phi_{1,7}$ for Nigerian Pidgin anchored to English. Experiments with
transformer models show higher accuracy in language identification and
translation on noisy or code-switched input when the $\phi$-indices are used to
guide fallback routing. The framework is compatible with ISO/TC 37 and provides
an AI-tractable, drift-aware semantic layer for future standards.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a practical solution to reduce
radiation dose, but the resulting ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Although deep learning and
diffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical
interpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling,
particularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image
synthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose
Residual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional
guidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to
significantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps.
However, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce
unrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each
iteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling
relies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by
electrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency,
resulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions. Inspired by ResNet, we
introduce a residual fusion module to linearly combine generative outputs with
data-consistent reconstructions, effectively preserving trajectory continuity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Poisson flow
models to sparse-view CT. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical
datasets demonstrate that ResPF achieves superior reconstruction quality,
faster inference, and stronger robustness compared to state-of-the-art
iterative, learning-based, and diffusion models.

Abstract: Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) represent a cutting-edge imaging
technology, capable of detecting individual photons with remarkable timing
precision. Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable
image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high
illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such
SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images
leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making
traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we
propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into
high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image
(I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary
SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D
scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline
(Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and
geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images enables morphometric
analysis of nuclei structures, which in turn helps in the detection and
diagnosis of diseases under consideration. To develop a nuclei segmentation
algorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,
image-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to
target domain image representations. One of the important issues with
image-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the
information content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this
regard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei
structures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding
space for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological
image space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating
judiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model
develops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization
framework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator
automatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The
proposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within
the framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the
image patches. The model provides a better trade-off between network complexity
and model performance compared to other existing models having complex network
architectures. The performance of the proposed deep generative model, along
with a comparison with state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation methods, is
demonstrated on publicly available histological image data sets.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images is an important task
for automated computer-aided analysis of histological images, particularly in
the presence of impermissible color variation in the color appearance of
stained tissue images. While color normalization enables better nuclei
segmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color
normalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep
generative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and
normalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model
judiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial
attention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,
corresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective
nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled
representation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification
or loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei
segmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the
stain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color
appearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.
The proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for
segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images. The performance of the
proposed approach, along with a comparative analysis with related
state-of-the-art algorithms, has been demonstrated on publicly available
standard histological image data sets.

Abstract: Brain tumors, regardless of being benign or malignant, pose considerable
health risks, with malignant tumors being more perilous due to their swift and
uncontrolled proliferation, resulting in malignancy. Timely identification is
crucial for enhancing patient outcomes, particularly in nations such as
Bangladesh, where healthcare infrastructure is constrained. Manual MRI analysis
is arduous and susceptible to inaccuracies, rendering it inefficient for prompt
diagnosis. This research sought to tackle these problems by creating an
automated brain tumor classification system utilizing MRI data obtained from
many hospitals in Bangladesh. Advanced deep learning models, including VGG16,
VGG19, and ResNet50, were utilized to classify glioma, meningioma, and various
brain cancers. Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies, such as Grad-CAM and
Grad-CAM++, were employed to improve model interpretability by emphasizing the
critical areas in MRI scans that influenced the categorization. VGG16 achieved
the most accuracy, attaining 99.17%. The integration of XAI enhanced the
system's transparency and stability, rendering it more appropriate for clinical
application in resource-limited environments such as Bangladesh. This study
highlights the capability of deep learning models, in conjunction with
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), to enhance brain tumor detection and

architectures, highlighting key examples such as CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo,
BioViL-T, and GLoRIA. We further examine their performance in multimodal
learning tasks using benchmark datasets like LIDC-IDRI, NLST, and MIMIC-CXR.
Applications span pulmonary nodule detection, gene mutation prediction,
multi-omics integration, and personalized treatment planning, with emerging
evidence of clinical deployment and validation. Finally, we discuss current
limitations in generalizability, interpretability, and regulatory compliance,
proposing future directions for building scalable, explainable, and clinically
integrated AI systems. Our review underscores the transformative potential of
large AI models to personalize and optimize lung cancer care.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical medicine, serving
as a tool for auxiliary diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring,
thus facilitating physicians in the study and treatment of diseases. However,
existing medical image segmentation methods are limited by the weak semantic
expression of the target segmentation regions, which is caused by the low
contrast between the target and non-target segmentation regions. To address
this limitation, text prompt information has greast potential to capture the
lesion location. However, existing text-guided methods suffer from insufficient
cross-modal interaction and inadequate cross-modal feature expression. To
resolve these issues, we propose the Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception
network (TMC). In TMC, we introduce a multistage cross-attention module to
enhance the model's understanding of semantic details and a multi-stage
alignment loss to improve the consistency of cross-modal semantics. The results
of the experiments demonstrate that our TMC achieves a superior performance
with Dice of 84.77%, 78.50%, 88.73% in three public datasets (QaTa-COV19,
MosMedData and Breast), outperforming UNet based networks and text-guided
methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With the remarkable progress in neural P-frame video coding, neural B-frame
coding has recently emerged as a critical research direction. However, most
existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without
adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to
suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for
motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we
design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an
interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive
quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional
motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and
reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an
interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between
bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging
partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a
selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to
achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal
contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a
hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling.
By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent
representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the
fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and
achieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC
reference software under random-access configurations.

Motivation: To explore the properties and applications of quantile-stratified sampling as an alternative to standard IID sampling in statistical simulations.

Method: Examining general properties of quantile-stratified sampling, comparing with IID sampling, and conducting simulation analysis on various functions.

this sampling method and we contrast it with standard IID sampling to highlight
its similarities and differences. We examine the applications of this sampling

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of model complexity and label recovery consistency in PABM for community detection.

Method: Proposed Thresholded Cosine Spectral Clustering (TCSC) algorithm and one-step/refined TCSC, along with a data-driven approach for community count selection.

Result: Achieved weak consistency with TCSC, strong consistency with refined TCSC, faster error convergence with two-step refined TCSC, and better community count selection than existing methods.

Conclusion: The methods are effective and robust, validated through simulations and real-world applications.

Abstract: The Popularity Adjusted Block Model (PABM) provides a flexible framework for
community detection in network data by allowing heterogeneous node popularity
across communities. However, this flexibility increases model complexity and
raises key unresolved challenges, particularly in effectively adapting spectral
clustering techniques and efficiently achieving strong consistency in label
recovery. To address these challenges, we first propose the Thresholded Cosine
Spectral Clustering (TCSC) algorithm and establish its weak consistency under
the PABM. We then introduce the one-step Refined TCSC algorithm and prove that
it achieves strong consistency under the PABM, correctly recovering all
community labels with high probability. We further show that the two-step
Refined TCSC accelerates clustering error convergence, especially with small
sample sizes. Additionally, we propose a data-driven approach for selecting the
number of communities, which outperforms existing methods under the PABM. The
effectiveness and robustness of our methods are validated through extensive
simulations and real-world applications.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Individual treatment effect (ITE) is often regarded as the ideal target of
inference in causal analyses and has been the focus of several recent studies.
In this paper, we describe the intrinsic limits regarding what can be learned
concerning ITEs given data from large randomized experiments. We consider when
a valid prediction interval for the ITE is informative and when it can be
bounded away from zero. The joint distribution over potential outcomes is only
partially identified from a randomized trial. Consequently, to be valid, an ITE
prediction interval must be valid for all joint distribution consistent with
the observed data and hence will in general be wider than that resulting from
knowledge of this joint distribution. We characterize prediction intervals in
the binary treatment and outcome setting, and extend these insights to models
with continuous and ordinal outcomes. We derive sharp bounds on the probability
mass function (pmf) of the individual treatment effect (ITE). Finally, we
contrast prediction intervals for the ITE and confidence intervals for the
average treatment effect (ATE). This also leads to the consideration of Fisher
versus Neyman null hypotheses. While confidence intervals for the ATE shrink
with increasing sample size due to its status as a population parameter,
prediction intervals for the ITE generally do not vanish, leading to scenarios
where one may reject the Neyman null yet still find evidence consistent with
the Fisher null, highlighting the challenges of individualized decision-making
under partial identification.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Assessing the causal effect of time-varying exposures on recurrent event
processes is challenging in the presence of a terminating event. Our objective
is to estimate both the short-term and delayed marginal causal effects of
exposures on recurrent events while addressing the bias of a potentially
correlated terminal event. Existing estimators based on marginal structural
models and proportional rate models are unsuitable for estimating delayed
marginal causal effects for many reasons, and furthermore, they do not account
for competing risks associated with a terminating event. To address these
limitations, we propose a class of semiparametric structural nested recurrent
event models and two estimators of short-term and delayed marginal causal
effects of exposures. We establish the asymptotic linearity of these two
estimators under regularity conditions through the novel use of modern
empirical process and semiparametric efficiency theory. We examine the
performance of these estimators via simulation and provide an R package sncure
to apply our methods in real data scenarios. Finally, we present the utility of
our methods in the context of a large epidemiological study of 299,661 Medicare
beneficiaries, where we estimate the effects of fine particulate matter air
pollution on recurrent hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A supervised learning approach is proposed for regularization of large
inverse problems where the main operator is built from noisy data. This is
germane to superresolution imaging via the sampling indicators of the inverse
scattering theory. We aim to accelerate the spatiotemporal regularization
process for this class of inverse problems to enable real-time imaging. In this
approach, a neural operator maps each pattern on the right-hand side of the
scattering equation to its affiliated regularization parameter. The network is
trained in two steps which entails: (1) training on low-resolution
regularization maps furnished by the Morozov discrepancy principle with
nonoptimal thresholds, and (2) optimizing network predictions through
minimization of the Tikhonov loss function regulated by the validation loss.
Step 2 allows for tailoring of the approximate maps of Step 1 toward
construction of higher quality images. This approach enables direct learning
from test data and dispenses with the need for a-priori knowledge of the
optimal regularization maps. The network, trained on low-resolution data,
quickly generates dense regularization maps for high-resolution imaging. We
highlight the importance of the training loss function on the network's
generalizability. In particular, we demonstrate that networks informed by the
logic of discrepancy principle lead to images of higher contrast. In this case,
the training process involves many-objective optimization. We propose a new
method to adaptively select the appropriate loss weights during training
without requiring an additional optimization process. The proposed approach is
synthetically examined for imaging damage evolution in an elastic plate. The
results indicate that the discrepancy-informed regularization networks not only
accelerate the imaging process, but also remarkably enhance the image quality
in complex environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation: In high-dimensional data, traditional methods for testing covariance matrices may not perform well. There is a need for a test that is sensitive to both dense and sparse alternatives.

Method: Method: The hybrid test combines a Frobenius-norm-based statistic (Li and Chen, 2012) with the leading eigenvalue approach (Zhang et al., 2022) using Fisher's method. Theoretical results include a joint central limit theorem demonstrating the asymptotic independence of leading eigenvalues and Frobenius norm estimator under certain conditions.

Result: Result: The proposed method controls the test level asymptotically and is consistent against both sparse and dense alternatives. Numerical studies show superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion: The hybrid test effectively addresses the challenges of high-dimensional covariance matrix testing by combining different statistical approaches, offering a robust solution for various alternative scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a two-sample test for covariance matrices in the high-dimensional
regime, where the dimension diverges proportionally to the sample size. Our
hybrid test combines a Frobenius-norm-based statistic as considered in Li and
Chen (2012) with the leading eigenvalue approach proposed in Zhang et al.
(2022), making it sensitive to both dense and sparse alternatives. The two
statistics are combined via Fisher's method, leveraging our key theoretical
result: a joint central limit theorem showing the asymptotic independence of
the leading eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix and an estimator of the
Frobenius norm of the difference of the two population covariance matrices,
under suitable signal conditions. The level of the test can be controlled
asymptotically, and we show consistency against certain types of both sparse
and dense alternatives. A comprehensive numerical study confirms the favorable
performance of our method compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional regression methods provide incomplete characterizations of dependence, and classical nonparametric techniques fail when conditional distributions lack a well-defined density, such as in data with discrete elements or complex low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: The paper derives minimax convergence rates for distribution regression under nonparametric assumptions, focusing on low-dimensional manifolds. It proposes a hybrid estimator combining adversarial learning with simultaneous least squares.

Result: The results establish lower bounds capturing the problem's inherent difficulty and demonstrate that the hybrid estimator achieves matching upper bounds, showing how smoothness and manifold geometry affect estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The study shows that distribution regression on low-dimensional manifolds can achieve optimal estimation accuracy by combining adversarial learning and least squares, with performance dependent on the smoothness of the conditional distribution and the geometry of the manifolds.

Abstract: Distribution regression seeks to estimate the conditional distribution of a
multivariate response given a continuous covariate. This approach offers a more
complete characterization of dependence than traditional regression methods.
Classical nonparametric techniques often assume that the conditional
distribution has a well-defined density, an assumption that fails in many
real-world settings. These include cases where data contain discrete elements
or lie on complex low-dimensional structures within high-dimensional spaces. In
this work, we establish minimax convergence rates for distribution regression
under nonparametric assumptions, focusing on scenarios where both covariates
and responses lie on low-dimensional manifolds. We derive lower bounds that
capture the inherent difficulty of the problem and propose a new hybrid
estimator that combines adversarial learning with simultaneous least squares to
attain matching upper bounds. Our results reveal how the smoothness of the
conditional distribution and the geometry of the underlying manifolds together
determine the estimation accuracy.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy
techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells'
morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The
collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the
relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular
state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive
learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that
aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,
the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to
substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to
natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of
perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent
space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a
cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages
pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to
better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image
embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing
perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models,
demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and
biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant
reductions in computation time.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs),
distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the
data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of
the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model
(PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training
method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring
additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the
current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal
preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing
training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update.
This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution.
Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to
consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model,
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on
AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par
with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.

Motivation: Accurate bank credit ratings are crucial for economic stability and stakeholder decisions, but complete interbank graphs are often hidden due to privacy, making GNNs hard to apply directly.

Method: Combines persistent homology with a traditional lending network to create a heterogeneous network for improved rating predictions.

Result: Experiments on a global dataset show HTGNN's effectiveness in predicting bank credit ratings despite missing interbank connection data.

Conclusion: The research helps investors and regulators with better risk management and market interventions by leveraging both data sources.

Abstract: Agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's provide bank credit ratings
that influence economic stability and decision-making by stakeholders. Accurate

often unavailable due to privacy concerns, complicating the direct application
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for rating prediction. our research utilizes
persistent homology to construct a network that captures relationships among
banks and combines this with a traditional lending network to create a
heterogeneous network that integrates information from both sources, leading to
improved predictions. Experiments on a global, real-world dataset validate the
effectiveness of HTGNN. This research has implications for investors and

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks

that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D

GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure

Abstract: Autoregressive Models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of Large
Language Models. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of
diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by
iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant
advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency.
Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are
incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To
address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that
dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where
most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we
propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines
long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature
similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations
without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative
dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1
x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably,
our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many
settings. Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released

Motivation: To enhance the performance of 3D point cloud classification by integrating KAN with DGCNN, leveraging polynomial expansions for better efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional MLP layers.

Result: KAN layers with Jacobi polynomials outperform linear layer-based DGCNN in accuracy and convergence speed on ModelNet40 while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Higher polynomial degrees do not necessarily improve performance, indicating the need for further research on polynomial bases, degrees, and graph-based learning mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN, a framework that integrates Dynamic Graph

replaces Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers with adaptable univariate

deep levels for both MLP and KAN to facilitate a layer-by-layer comparison. In
comparative experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset, KAN layers employing Jacobi
polynomials outperform the traditional linear layer-based DGCNN baseline in
terms of accuracy and convergence speed, while maintaining parameter

automatically improve performance, highlighting the need for further

Abstract: Scheduling echocardiographic exams in a hospital presents significant
challenges due to non-deterministic factors (e.g., patient no-shows, patient
arrival times, diverse exam durations, etc.) and asymmetric resource
constraints between fetal and non-fetal patient streams. To address these
challenges, we first conducted extensive pre-processing on one week of
operational data from the Echo Laboratory at Stanford University's Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, to estimate patient no-show probabilities and
derive empirical distributions of arrival times and exam durations. Based on
these inputs, we developed a discrete-event stochastic simulation model using
SimPy, and integrate it with the open source Gymnasium Python library. As a
baseline for policy optimization, we developed a comparative framework to
evaluate on-the-fly versus reservation-based allocation strategies, in which
different proportions of resources are reserved in advance. Considering a
hospital configuration with a 1:6 ratio of fetal to non-fetal rooms and a 4:2
ratio of fetal to non-fetal sonographers, we show that on-the-fly allocation
generally yields better performance, more effectively adapting to patient
variability and resource constraints. Building on this foundation, we apply
reinforcement learning (RL) to derive an approximated optimal dynamic
allocation policy. This RL-based policy is benchmarked against the
best-performing rule-based strategies, allowing us to quantify their
differences and provide actionable insights for improving echo lab efficiency
through intelligent, data-driven resource management.

*Daniel Halpern,Evi Micha,Ariel D. Procaccia,Itai Shapira*

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a distribution of multiple reward functions to reflect diverse human preferences, learning from pairwise preferences without needing annotator identities or groups, and shows improved calibration in representing varied values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods rely on a single, universal notion of desirable behavior, but human preferences vary across users, contexts, and cultures, leading to minority perspectives being overlooked. The motivation is to create a more pluralistic approach that accounts for these differences.

Method: The method involves learning a distribution over multiple reward functions directly from pairwise preferences, treating annotator disagreements as soft labels without requiring annotator identifiers or predefined groups. The central criterion is pairwise calibration, ensuring the proportion of reward functions preferring a response matches the fraction of annotators with that preference.

Result: The paper demonstrates that even a small ensemble of reward functions can accurately represent diverse preference distributions. They introduce a practical training heuristic and show improved calibration, indicating a more faithful representation of pluralistic values.

Conclusion: By using an ensemble of reward functions calibrated through pairwise preferences, the approach better captures diverse human preferences, leading to more aligned policies that reflect a broader range of values rather than just majority opinions.

Abstract: Current alignment pipelines presume a single, universal notion of desirable
behavior. However, human preferences often diverge across users, contexts, and
cultures. As a result, disagreement collapses into the majority signal and
minority perspectives are discounted. To address this, we propose reflecting
diverse human preferences through a distribution over multiple reward
functions, each inducing a distinct aligned policy. The distribution is learned
directly from pairwise preference without annotator identifiers or predefined
groups. Instead, annotator disagreements are treated as informative soft
labels. Our central criterion is pairwise calibration: for every pair of
candidate responses, the proportion of reward functions preferring one response
matches the fraction of annotators with that preference. We prove that even a
small outlier-free ensemble can accurately represent diverse preference
distributions. Empirically, we introduce and validate a practical training
heuristic to learn such ensembles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through
improved calibration, implying a more faithful representation of pluralistic
values.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a human-designed framework for solving
sequential decision making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that,
surprisingly, RL emerges in LLM's (Large Language Model) inference time -- a
phenomenon known as in-context RL (ICRL). Specifically, we propose a novel
multi-round prompting framework called ICRL prompting. The goal is to prompt
the LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current
round, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards.
At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context
consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality
of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM
is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like
an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24,
creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance
improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.
Surprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM
itself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting,
offering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to improve energy management
in smart grids by enhancing situational awareness and supporting more effective
decision-making. While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable
results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with
generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration.
Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling
complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data
fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In
this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the
energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural
foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of
transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We
then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning
for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new
challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical
implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly
expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend:
Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in
high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and
grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these
developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a
next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and
social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.

Abstract: Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are
rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across
interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize
losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful
capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data,
yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing
surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than
extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first
overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically
review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly
those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and
sampling mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize
benchmark datasets and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering
statistical, dependence, visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central
contribution is our in-depth analysis of each metric's applicability in
extremeness and domain-specific adaptations, providing actionable guidance for
model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize key application domains and
identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance, wildfires, earthquakes,
windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline open challenges,
providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event research.

Motivation: Positional encodings are essential for transformers to process sequences, but their theoretical understanding is limited. The paper aims to address this gap by analyzing how different methods affect transformer performance.

Method: The authors use function approximation to assess expressiveness, Rademacher complexity for generalization bounds, and propose new positional encodings based on orthogonal functions. They also extend ALiBi's approach into a unified theoretical framework.

Result: Orthogonal transform-based encodings outperform sinusoidal methods in generalization and extrapolation on synthetic tasks, with implications for NLP and computer vision applications.

Conclusion: The study bridges a critical gap in transformer theory, offering insights into positional encoding design that can enhance model performance across various domains.

Abstract: Positional encodings are a core part of transformer-based models, enabling
processing of sequential data without recurrence. This paper presents a
theoretical framework to analyze how various positional encoding methods,
including sinusoidal, learned, relative, and bias-based methods like Attention
with Linear Biases (ALiBi), impact a transformer's expressiveness,
generalization ability, and extrapolation to longer sequences. Expressiveness
is defined via function approximation, generalization bounds are established
using Rademacher complexity, and new encoding methods based on orthogonal
functions, such as wavelets and Legendre polynomials, are proposed. The
extrapolation capacity of existing and proposed encodings is analyzed,
extending ALiBi's biasing approach to a unified theoretical context.
Experimental evaluation on synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks shows that
orthogonal transform-based encodings outperform traditional sinusoidal
encodings in generalization and extrapolation. This work addresses a critical
gap in transformer theory, providing insights for design choices in natural
language processing, computer vision, and other transformer applications.

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational
chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation.
However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for
downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge
this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five
diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our
results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently
outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings
from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an
average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to
these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%,
with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art
results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation
between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an
efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal
layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance
of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve
substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase
alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have
exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.
Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning
capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.
Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and
effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional
inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform
poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like
Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified
challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high
computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)
evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference
scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our
approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that
significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To
operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision
training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to
prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value
caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree
search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.
Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model
(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)
to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a
powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most
methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use
natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality.
This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse
problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem
Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for
generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs
using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for
problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate
over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the
generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the
resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally,
we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality
and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured
by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further,
while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit
in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more
robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data
scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit
downstream model generalization.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in various
real-world applications. However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV
systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained
environments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of
multiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial
networks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we
consider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate,
and change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow.
Different from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and
collaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an
LLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard
each UAV handles motion planning and control. This LLM-based framework
leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both
high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This
knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of
next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system
rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates
compared to baseline approaches.

Abstract: Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field
of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation,
summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains
computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with
limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in
mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges,
recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection
strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query
complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to
larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary
strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most
suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference
(HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident
response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using
lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We
provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance
metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we
outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive
model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across
heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and
accessible for real world applications.

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via
reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1
have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks.
However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on
inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from
curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H),
allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H
Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important
initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in
preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for
E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive
finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately
decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer
total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show
that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs
(1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the effectiveness of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) by selecting and ordering demonstration examples more effectively.

Result: The result shows a 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across classification tasks compared to random example selection.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that MarginSel enhances ICL by increasing margins for hard examples, similar to support vectors, leading to better decision boundaries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at few-shot learning via in-context

selection and ordering of demonstration examples. To address this, we present
MarginSel: Max-Margin Demonstration Selection for LLMs, a two-step method that
selects hard demonstration examples for the ICL prompt, adapting to each test
instance. Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across
classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples. We also
provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence showing that MarginSel
induces max-margin behavior in LLMs by effectively increasing the margin for
hard examples, analogous to support vectors, thereby shifting the decision

Motivation: To improve the expressivity of graph representation learning by incorporating topological and spectral information, addressing the limitations of existing PH-based methods that rely on features and fail to capture structural information.

Method: Proposing SpectRe, which integrates spectral information into PH diagrams, and introducing global and local stability notions to analyze descriptors.

Result: SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors, is locally stable, and experiments show its effectiveness on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SpectRe enhances graph models' capabilities in learning tasks by combining topological and spectral information, offering a more expressive and stable approach.

Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances
the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods
are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context,
recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and
edge features for improved expressivity. However, due to their dependence on
features, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural
information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor
for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably,
SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We
also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing
descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments
on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe
and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant
learning tasks.

Motivation: Traditional GNNs struggle with complex textual information in TAGs. Existing methods using LLMs require extensive annotations or fine-tuning, which are time-consuming and costly.

Result: GAGA achieves classification accuracies comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods with just 1% of the data annotated.

Conclusion: GAGA effectively addresses the challenges of TAG representation learning by minimizing annotation requirements while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: In the realm of Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs), traditional graph neural
networks (GNNs) often fall short due to the complex textual information
associated with each node. Recent methods have improved node representations by
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance node text features, but
these approaches typically require extensive annotations or fine-tuning across
all nodes, which is both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GAGA, an efficient framework for TAG representation
learning. GAGA reduces annotation time and cost by focusing on annotating only
representative nodes and edges. It constructs an annotation graph that captures
the topological relationships among these annotations. Furthermore, GAGA
employs a two-level alignment module to effectively integrate the annotation
graph with the TAG, aligning their underlying structures. Experiments show that
GAGA achieves classification accuracies on par with or surpassing
state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of the data to be annotated,

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and
energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the
electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power
management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and
application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and
insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end,
this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates
"image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts
multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into
visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural
networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices;
at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature
generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome
model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a
large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a
variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the
proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these
style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind
jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we seek
to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial
style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these
risks during alignment. We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks,
and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success
rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both
the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on
them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that
fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of
those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that
incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the
distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and
five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines
in maintaining LLM safety.

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly Transformers, have been widely adopted for
predicting the functional properties of proteins. In this work, we focus on
exploring whether Protein Transformers can capture biological intelligence
among protein sequences. To achieve our goal, we first introduce a protein
function dataset, namely Protein-FN, providing over 9000 protein data with
meaningful labels. Second, we devise a new Transformer architecture, namely
Sequence Protein Transformers (SPT), for computationally efficient protein
function predictions. Third, we develop a novel Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) technique called Sequence Score, which can efficiently
interpret the decision-making processes of protein models, thereby overcoming
the difficulty of deciphering biological intelligence bided in Protein
Transformers. Remarkably, even our smallest SPT-Tiny model, which contains only
5.4M parameters, demonstrates impressive predictive accuracy, achieving 94.3%
on the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) dataset and 99.6% on the Protein-FN dataset,
all accomplished by training from scratch. Besides, our Sequence Score
technique helps reveal that our SPT models can discover several meaningful
patterns underlying the sequence structures of protein data, with these
patterns aligning closely with the domain knowledge in the biology community.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive,
disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive
fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates
a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders
perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose
Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an
attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast
safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates
between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and
safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This
enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of
zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the
design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the
defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.
Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared
to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on
safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained
against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing
agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces
over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive
co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust
self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In view of the problem that each subchain in the chain-of-model (CoM) relies
only on the information of the previous subchain and may lose long-range
dependencies due to the causal mask blocking the global context flow between
multi-level subchains, this work proposes a graph of causal evolution (GoCE).
Its core principle is to map the implicit token representation into a
differentiable and sparse causal adjacency matrix, then permeate causal
constraints through each layer of calculation using causal-masked attention and
causal-MoE. By combining intervention consistency loss test and self-evolution
gate, the dynamic balance between causal structure learning and adaptive
updating of transformer architecture is realized. The researcher built
experimental environments in sandboxes built with Claude Sonnet 4,
o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 respectively with the transformer variant
architecture introduced in GoCE. It is evaluated on publicly available datasets
including CLUTRR, CLADDER, EX-FEVER, and CausalQA and compared with the
baseline LLMs. The finding proves that GoCE strengthens the transformer's
ability to capture long-range causal dependencies, while the ability to
self-evolve is improved. It not only surpasses the design of CoM in terms of
design principles, but also provides experience for future research on causal
learning and continuous adaptive improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising
capabilities in chemistry tasks while still facing challenges due to outdated
pretraining knowledge and the difficulty of incorporating specialized chemical
expertise. To address these issues, we propose an LLM-based agent that
synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from
basic information retrieval to complex reaction predictions, and a dataset
curation pipeline to generate the dataset ChemToolBench that facilitates both
effective tool selection and precise parameter filling during fine-tuning and
evaluation. We introduce a Hierarchical Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search
(HE-MCTS) framework, enabling independent optimization of tool planning and
execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level
fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM
that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks,
offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for
advanced chemical applications. All datasets and code are available at

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first practical algorithms with provable
guarantees for the problem of inferring the topics assigned to each document in
an LDA topic model. This is the primary inference problem for many applications
of topic models in social science, data exploration, and causal inference
settings. We obtain this result by showing a novel non-gradient-based,
combinatorial approach to estimating topic models. This yields algorithms that
converge to near-optimal posterior probability in logarithmic parallel
computation time (adaptivity) -- exponentially faster than any known LDA
algorithm. We also show that our approach can provide interpretability
guarantees such that each learned topic is formally associated with a known
keyword. Finally, we show that unlike alternatives, our approach can maintain
the independence assumptions necessary to use the learned topic model for
downstream causal inference methods that allow researchers to study topics as
treatments. In terms of practical performance, our approach consistently
returns solutions of higher semantic quality than solutions from
state-of-the-art LDA algorithms, neural topic models, and LLM-based topic
models across a diverse range of text datasets and evaluation parameters.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.
However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits
their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical
barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic
acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,
artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token
sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic
entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding
and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we
introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method
that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences
that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional
next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional
applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo
protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the
prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first
to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively
democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and
researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method
suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community. All

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines
under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a
substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test
distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across
different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means
and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global
normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data
characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance
Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise
Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and
Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar
distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN
optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific
statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which
layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby
enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy
improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function from
expert demonstrations. Recently, Optimal Transport (OT) methods have been
successfully deployed to align trajectories and infer rewards. While OT-based
methods have shown strong empirical results, they introduce algorithmic
complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, and require solving the OT optimization
problems. In this work, we challenge the necessity of OT in IRL by proposing
two simple, heuristic alternatives: (1) Minimum-Distance Reward, which assigns
rewards based on the nearest expert state regardless of temporal order; and (2)
Segment-Matching Reward, which incorporates lightweight temporal alignment by
matching agent states to corresponding segments in the expert trajectory. These
methods avoid optimization, exhibit linear-time complexity, and are easy to
implement. Through extensive evaluations across 32 online and offline
benchmarks with three reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that our
simple rewards match or outperform recent OT-based approaches. Our findings
suggest that the core benefits of OT may arise from basic proximity alignment
rather than its optimal coupling formulation, advocating for reevaluation of
complexity in future IRL design.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence
modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting,
speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been
viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that
linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance
comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in
recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and
what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks
(AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a
flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory.
Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus
selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but
often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more
interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results
provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity,
bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range
memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with
implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing heterogeneous graph SSL models convert graphs into homogeneous ones using meta-paths, but they only use information from the ends of meta-paths, not the internal nodes, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: IMPA-HGAE framework that utilizes internal node information along meta-paths and innovative masking strategies for generative SSL models.

Result: IMPA-HGAE shows superior performance on heterogeneous datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of using meta-path-guided structural semantics for robust representation learning in complex graphs and suggests future directions for generative SSL in this area.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been increasingly applied to
diverse downstream tasks due to their superior generalization capabilities and
low annotation costs. However, most existing heterogeneous graph SSL models
convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones via meta-paths for training,
which only leverage information from nodes at both ends of meta-paths while
underutilizing the heterogeneous node information along the meta-paths. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named IMPA-HGAE
to enhance target node embeddings by fully exploiting internal node information
along meta-paths. Experimental results validate that IMPA-HGAE achieves
superior performance on heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, this paper
introduce innovative masking strategies to strengthen the representational
capacity of generative SSL models on heterogeneous graph data. Additionally,
this paper discuss the interpretability of the proposed method and potential
future directions for generative self-supervised learning in heterogeneous
graphs. This work provides insights into leveraging meta-path-guided structural
semantics for robust representation learning in complex graph scenarios.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements

fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in
scientific and engineering domains.

POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a
fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral
properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function
with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that
make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in

Abstract: Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world
applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors
or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and
noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these
challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient
framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed
Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for
traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and
entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key
components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering,
facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between
the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural
representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation
performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely
labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate
sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica
datasets.

Abstract: Effective surrogate models are critical for accelerating scientific
simulations. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer a compact and
continuous framework for modeling spatially structured data, but they often
struggle with complex scientific fields exhibiting localized, high-frequency
variations. Recent approaches address this by introducing additional features
along rigid geometric structures (e.g., grids), but at the cost of flexibility
and increased model size. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
alternative: Feature-Adaptive INR (FA-INR). FA-INR leverages cross-attention to
an augmented memory bank to learn flexible feature representations, enabling
adaptive allocation of model capacity based on data characteristics, rather
than rigid structural assumptions. To further improve scalability, we introduce
a coordinate-guided mixture of experts (MoE) that enhances the specialization
and efficiency of feature representations. Experiments on three large-scale
ensemble simulation datasets show that FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art
fidelity while significantly reducing model size, establishing a new trade-off
frontier between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.

Motivation: Sparsifying neural networks leads to performance degradation, and restoring original performance is challenging. The motivation is to find subnetworks that are both sparse and flat.

Method: Formulate pruning as a sparsity-constrained optimization problem with flatness as an objective, solved via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and generalized projection operation.

Result: SAFE produces sparse networks with improved generalization, competitive with baselines, and resilient to noisy data.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the challenge of performance degradation in sparsified networks, offering better generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable
performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original
performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust
optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are
both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a
sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an
objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and
extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in
novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive
evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal
that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization
performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In
addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for
real-world conditions.

Motivation: Accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs is challenging, especially under distributional shifts. Traditional uncertainty estimation methods do not account for randomness from both graph structure and label distribution.

Method: The authors draw an analogy between the evolution of a stochastic SPDE driven by a Matern Gaussian Process and message passing in GNN layers, proposing a principled method to design a new message passing scheme with spatial-temporal noises.

Result: The experiments show that the proposed method enhances uncertainty estimates on graphs with both low and high label informativeness and outperforms existing approaches in OOD detection on graph datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their model provides a sound and superior approach for uncertainty estimation in GNNs by effectively capturing spatial-temporal uncertainty and controlling covariance kernel smoothness.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network
modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains
difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional
uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness
arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds
complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian
Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to
design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises
motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously
captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the
covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs
with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label
informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to

Abstract: This work introduces GraPhy, a graph-based, physics-guided learning framework
for high-resolution and accurate air quality modeling in urban areas with

evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-square

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers
aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while
keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input
to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all
queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric
costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may
trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly
than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,
effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we
propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query
costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core
components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation
process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative
variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and
Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution
to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total
attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods
such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)
queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box
attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across
various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost
and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to
40% in some settings.

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial
for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed,
low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages,
tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational
techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building
models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets,
faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage
of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of
unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art
meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse
distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall
distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact
training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in
\textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain
evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts
and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building
models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable
document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each
exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is
adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final
layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method
focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed
with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by
mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We
experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more
than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance. The source code is available

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Domain generalization has become a critical challenge in clinical prediction,
where patient cohorts often exhibit shifting data distributions that degrade
model performance. Typical domain generalization approaches struggle in
real-world healthcare settings for two main reasons: (1) patient-specific
domain labels are typically unavailable, making domain discovery especially
difficult; (2) purely data-driven approaches overlook key clinical insights,
leading to a gap in medical knowledge integration. To address these problems,
we leverage hierarchical medical ontologies like the ICD-9-CM hierarchy to
group diseases into higher-level categories and discover more flexible latent
domains. In this paper, we introduce UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided framework
that iteratively prunes fine-grained domains, encodes these refined domains,
and applies a Siamese-type inference mechanism to separate domain-related
signals from patient-level features. Experimental results on clinical datasets
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) show that the proposed model achieves higher
performance compared to other domain generalization baselines when substantial
domain gaps presents, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge
for enhancing domain generalization in practical healthcare applications.

Abstract: Cancer subtype classification is crucial for personalized treatment and
prognostic assessment. However, effectively integrating multi-omic data remains
challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of genomic, epigenomic, and
transcriptomic features. In this work, we propose Modality-Aware
Cross-Attention MoXGATE, a novel deep-learning framework that leverages
cross-attention and learnable modality weights to enhance feature fusion across
multiple omics sources. Our approach effectively captures inter-modality
dependencies, ensuring robust and interpretable integration. Through
experiments on Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma (GIAC) and Breast Cancer (BRCA)
datasets from TCGA, we demonstrate that MoXGATE outperforms existing methods,
achieving 95\% classification accuracy. Ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of cross-attention over simple concatenation and highlight the
importance of different omics modalities. Moreover, our model generalizes well
to unseen cancer types e.g., breast cancer, underscoring its adaptability. Key
contributions include (1) a cross-attention-based multi-omic integration
framework, (2) modality-weighted fusion for enhanced interpretability, (3)
application of focal loss to mitigate data imbalance, and (4) validation across
multiple cancer subtypes. Our results indicate that MoXGATE is a promising
approach for multi-omic cancer subtype classification, offering improved
performance and biological generalizability.

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined
threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS
spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb
illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and
illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI
generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories)
and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification.
Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection
using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider
fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting
in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a
physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to
identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results
on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed
framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate
for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our
implementation is available at

Abstract: We present a general purpose probabilistic forecasting framework,
ProbHardE2E, to learn systems that can incorporate operational/physical
constraints as hard requirements. ProbHardE2E enforces hard constraints by
exploiting variance information in a novel way; and thus it is also capable of
performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the model. Our methodology uses a
novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined
with a wide range of neural network architectures. This DPPL allows the model
to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where
the constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at
inference. In addition, ProbHardE2E can optimize a strictly proper scoring
rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which
enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing
approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are
heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it
can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of
modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E to problems in learning partial
differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic
time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general setup
that connects these seemingly disparate domains.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their
ability to refuse malicious prompts, especially jailbreak attacks, is essential
for safe and reliable use. Recently, activation steering has emerged as an
effective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction
vector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further
induce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying
activation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and
utility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and
degraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector
calibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this
trade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and
effectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we
present a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering
method called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a
learnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation
and safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a
nearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints.
For safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for
steering malicious data, with the help of linear regression. Experiments across
multiple jailbreak attacks and utility benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of AlphaSteer, which significantly improves the safety of LLMs without
compromising general capabilities. Our codes are available at

Motivation: The motivation is to develop algorithms for distributionally robust reinforcement learning in average reward settings, addressing uncertainty sets like contamination, TV distance, and Wasserstein distance.

Method: The method involves constructing a semi-norm to show the robust Q Bellman operator is contractive, enabling stochastic approximation for Q function learning. It also integrates robust policy mirror descent for actor-critic algorithms.

Result: The results demonstrate that the algorithms achieve non-asymptotic convergence with sample complexities of O(epsilon^{-2}) for Q function learning and O(epsilon^{-3}) for finding an epsilon-optimal robust policy.

Conclusion: The paper advances the theory of distributionally robust reinforcement learning in average reward settings by providing efficient algorithms with rigorous sample complexity bounds.

Abstract: We present the first $Q$-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust
average reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with non-asymptotic convergence
under contamination, TV distance and Wasserstein distance uncertainty sets. We
show that the robust $Q$ Bellman operator is a strict contractive mapping with
respect to a carefully constructed semi-norm with constant functions being
quotiented out. This property supports a stochastic approximation update, that
learns the optimal robust $Q$ function in $\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples.
We also show that the same idea can be used for robust $Q$ function estimation,
which can be further used for critic estimation. Coupling it with theories in
robust policy mirror descent update, we present a natural actor-critic
algorithm that attains an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy in
$\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-3})$ samples. These results advance the theory of
distributionally robust reinforcement learning in the average reward setting.

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in
the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the
reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the
enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a
core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning.
Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively
enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their
further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we
propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that
explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby
can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from
the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual
references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM
to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses
generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these
consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

Motivation: Classical policy gradient methods often get stuck in suboptimal local optima, especially in complex environments.

Method: Integrates an m-step lookahead mechanism into policy gradient methods.

Result: PGTS reduces undesirable stationary points and improves worst-case performance; it can escape local traps and find better solutions in various environments.

Conclusion: PGTS enhances policy optimization through tree search, offering a promising approach for challenging reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Classical policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently
converge to suboptimal local optima, a challenge exacerbated in large or
complex environments. This work investigates Policy Gradient with Tree Search
(PGTS), an approach that integrates an $m$-step lookahead mechanism to enhance
policy optimization. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that
increasing the tree search depth $m$-monotonically reduces the set of
undesirable stationary points and, consequently, improves the worst-case
performance of any resulting stationary policy. Critically, our analysis
accommodates practical scenarios where policy updates are restricted to states
visited by the current policy, rather than requiring updates across the entire
state space. Empirical evaluations on diverse MDP structures, including Ladder,
Tightrope, and Gridworld environments, illustrate PGTS's ability to exhibit
"farsightedness," navigate challenging reward landscapes, escape local traps
where standard PG fails, and achieve superior solutions.

Abstract: Patient similarity computation (PSC) is a fundamental problem in healthcare
informatics. The aim of the patient similarity computation is to measure the
similarity among patients according to their historical clinical records, which
helps to improve clinical decision support. This paper presents a novel
distributed patient similarity computation (DPSC) technique based on data
transformation (DT) methods, utilizing an effective combination of time series
and static data. Time series data are sensor-collected patients' information,
including metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, Oxygen saturation,
respiration, etc. The static data are mainly patient background and demographic
data, including age, weight, height, gender, etc. Static data has been used for
clustering the patients. Before feeding the static data to the machine learning
model adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE) and Z-score data transformation (DT)
methods have been performed, which improve the prediction performances. In
aWOE-based patient similarity models, sensitive patient information has been
processed using aWOE which preserves the data privacy of the trained models. We
used the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach, which is robust and very popular,
for time series similarity. However, DTW is not suitable for big data due to
the significant computational run-time. To overcome this problem, distributed
DTW computation is used in this study. For Coronary Artery Disease, our DT
based approach boosts prediction performance by as much as 11.4%, 10.20%, and
12.6% in terms of AUC, accuracy, and F-measure, respectively. In the case of
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), our proposed method achieves performance
enhancement up to 15.9%, 10.5%, and 21.9% for the same measures, respectively.
The proposed method reduces the computation time by as high as 40%.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in
shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar
samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key
limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding
distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart
unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance
on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization.
To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive
Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as
variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a
posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive
pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants
fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space.
Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while
converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision
boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by
KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning
assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning
than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation
strategies.

Abstract: Missing data in spatiotemporal systems presents a significant challenge for
modern applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban traffic
management. The integrity of spatiotemporal data often deteriorates due to
hardware malfunctions and software failures in real-world deployments. Current
approaches based on machine learning and deep learning struggle to model the
intricate interdependencies between spatial and temporal dimensions effectively
and, more importantly, suffer from cumulative errors during the data imputation
process, which propagate and amplify through iterations. To address these
limitations, we propose CoFILL, a novel Conditional Diffusion Model for
spatiotemporal data imputation. CoFILL builds on the inherent advantages of
diffusion models to generate high-quality imputations without relying on
potentially error-prone prior estimates. It incorporates an innovative
dual-stream architecture that processes temporal and frequency domain features
in parallel. By fusing these complementary features, CoFILL captures both rapid
fluctuations and underlying patterns in the data, which enables more robust
imputation. The extensive experiments reveal that CoFILL's noise prediction
network successfully transforms random noise into meaningful values that align
with the true data distribution. The results also show that CoFILL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy. The source code is publicly

Abstract: The pursuit of universal black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms is a
longstanding goal. However, unlike domains such as language or vision, where
scaling structured data has driven generalization, progress in offline BBO
remains hindered by the lack of unified representations for heterogeneous
numerical spaces. Thus, existing offline BBO approaches are constrained to
single-task and fixed-dimensional settings, failing to achieve cross-domain
universal optimization. Recent advances in language models (LMs) offer a
promising path forward: their embeddings capture latent relationships in a
unifying way, enabling universal optimization across different data types
possible. In this paper, we discuss multiple potential approaches, including an
end-to-end learning framework in the form of next-token prediction, as well as
prioritizing the learning of latent spaces with strong representational
capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of these methods, we collect
offline BBO tasks and data from open-source academic works for training.
Experiments demonstrate the universality and effectiveness of our proposed
methods. Our findings suggest that unifying language model priors and learning
string embedding space can overcome traditional barriers in universal BBO,
paving the way for general-purpose BBO algorithms. The code is provided at

Abstract: Ensuring safety of large language models (LLMs) is important. Red teaming--a
systematic approach to identifying adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
responses from target LLMs--has emerged as a crucial safety evaluation method.
Within this framework, the diversity of adversarial prompts is essential for
comprehensive safety assessments. We find that previous approaches to
red-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue
diversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding
similarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies.
Second, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts
coverage across potential attack styles and risk categories. This paper
introduces Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming (QDRT), a new framework designed to
address these limitations. QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through
behavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an
open-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers
capable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk
categories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks
that are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target
LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5. This work advances the
field of LLM safety by providing a systematic and effective approach to
automated red-teaming, ultimately supporting the responsible deployment of
LLMs.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models

crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications.
Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models
integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress
in representation learning. However, current methods still have some
limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information,
which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware
and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding
approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological
structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational
nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we
introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations
through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and
dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language
models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural
architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified
semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot
prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we
propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures,
resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP
benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA
while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction
capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the

Result: The result is a novel approach that achieves high-level semantic identity preservation in diffusion counterfactuals and enables controlled trade-offs between causal fidelity and identity preservation.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that this work is the first to consider semantic identity preservation in diffusion counterfactuals, showing that semantic control allows for principled balance between faithful causal control and identity preservation.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including
preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness
to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit
semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they
struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models
present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having
demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and
representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of
diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic
and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic
representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to
edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for
diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables
principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity
preservation.

Abstract: Despite decades of research, it remains challenging to correctly use
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms with function approximation. A prime
example is policy iteration, whose fundamental guarantee of monotonic
improvement collapses even under linear function approximation. To address this
issue, we introduce Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI). It replaces the common
projection or Bellman-error minimization during policy evaluation with a
Bellman-based constrained optimization. We prove that not only does RPI confer
textbook monotonicity on its value estimates but these estimates also lower
bound the true return. Also, their limit partially satisfies the unprojected
Bellman equation, emphasizing RPI's natural fit within RL. RPI is the first
algorithm with such monotonicity and convergence guarantees under function
approximation. For practical use, we provide a model-free variant of RPI that
amounts to a novel critic. It can be readily integrated into primary model-free
PI implementations such as DQN and DDPG. In classical control tasks, such
RPI-enhanced variants consistently maintain their lower-bound guarantee while
matching or surpassing the performance of all baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multimodal generation with diffusion models depend on external preprocessing like tokenizers and VAEs, which require accurate encoders/decoders and struggle with limited data.

Method: Introduces a decoupled noise schedule per modality to enable unconditional and modality-conditioned generation in a single model.

Result: Empirically validated on text-image generation and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, showing competitive performance.

Conclusion: The framework allows building multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native generation across modalities without external preprocessing constraints.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text
generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through
diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing
approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers
and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a
unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of
encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited
data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building
multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native
generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an
innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both
unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model
simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation
and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves
competitive performance.

Abstract: Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have
recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These
approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to
generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work,
we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model
weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during
training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely
by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple
interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform
simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight
ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We
further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by
modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image
diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a
realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model,
and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new
domains. Our code is available at

Abstract: Existing multi-objective preference alignment methods for large language
models (LLMs) face limitations: (1) the inability to effectively balance
various preference dimensions, and (2) reliance on auxiliary reward/reference
models introduces computational complexity. To address these challenges, we
propose Adaptive Multi-objective Preference Optimization (AMoPO), a novel
framework that achieves dynamic balance across preference dimensions. By
introducing the multi-objective optimization paradigm to use the
dimension-aware generation metrics as implicit rewards, AMoPO aligns LLMs with
diverse preferences without additional reward models or reference models. We
introduce an adaptive weight assignment mechanism that models the generation
space as a Gaussian distribution, allowing dynamic prioritization of preference
dimensions. Empirical results demonstrate that AMoPO outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 28.5%, and the experiments on 7B, 14B, and 32B
models reveal the scaling ability of AMoPO. Moreover, additional analysis of
multiple dimensions verifies its adaptability and effectiveness. These findings
validate AMoPO's capability to achieve dimension-aware preference alignment,
highlighting its superiority. Our codes and datasets are available at

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a critical task in spatial-temporal forecasting with
broad applications in travel planning and urban management. Adaptive graph
convolution networks have emerged as mainstream solutions due to their ability
to learn node embeddings in a data-driven manner and capture complex latent
dependencies. However, existing adaptive graph learning methods for traffic
forecasting often either ignore the regularization of node embeddings, which
account for a significant proportion of model parameters, or face scalability
issues from expensive graph convolution operations. To address these
challenges, we propose a Regularized Adaptive Graph Learning (RAGL) model.
First, we introduce a regularized adaptive graph learning framework that
synergizes Stochastic Shared Embedding (SSE) and adaptive graph convolution via
a residual difference mechanism, achieving both embedding regularization and
noise suppression. Second, to ensure scalability on large road networks, we
develop the Efficient Cosine Operator (ECO), which performs graph convolution
based on the cosine similarity of regularized embeddings with linear time
complexity. Extensive experiments on four large-scale real-world traffic
datasets show that RAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits competitive computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated
strong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's
internal "thinking" process and the final response. A key factor influencing
answer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the
reasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the
task. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to
unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and
exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the
length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show
that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an
interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights
on the model's planning dynamics. Second, we manipulate the internal progress
encoding during inference to reduce unnecessary steps and generate a more
concise and decisive chain of thoughts. Our empirical results demonstrate that
this "overclocking" method mitigates overthinking, improves answer accuracy,
and reduces inference latency. Our code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce the tokenized linear bandit (TLB) and multi-armed bandit (TMAB),
variants of linear and stochastic multi-armed bandit problems inspired by LLM
decoding and alignment. In these problems, at each round $t \in [T]$, a user
submits a query (context), and the decision maker (DM) sequentially selects a
token irrevocably from a token set. Once the sequence is complete, the DM
observes a random utility from the user, whose expectation is presented by a
sequence function mapping the chosen token sequence to a nonnegative real value
that depends on the query.
  In both problems, we first show that learning is impossible without any
structure on the sequence function. We introduce a natural assumption,
diminishing distance with more commons (DDMC), and propose algorithms with
regret $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T^{2/3}})$ for TLB and
TMAB, respectively. As a side product, we obtain an (almost) optimality of the
greedy decoding for LLM decoding algorithm under DDMC, which justifies the
unresaonable effectiveness of greedy decoding in several tasks. This also has
an immediate application to decoding-time LLM alignment, when the misaligned
utility can be represented as the frozen LLM's utility and a linearly
realizable latent function. We finally validate our algorithm's performance
empirically as well as verify our assumptions using synthetic and real-world
datasets.

scientists on using ICL as a diagnostic tool for complex data. On real-world
animal decision-making tasks, ICL achieves competitive performance with models
designed by human experts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
that ICL can learn and predict HMM-generated sequences$\unicode{x2013}$an

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face memory inefficiencies during long-context inference because of how they handle key-value (KV) caches. Current methods lead to internal fragmentation and inefficient allocations.

Method: The paper proposes a novel integration of PagedAttention with PyTorch's FlexAttention. This approach efficiently gathers scattered KV data through a fused attention kernel implemented in IBM's Foundation Model Stack (FMS).

Result: Benchmarks on an NVIDIA L4 GPU showed that inference latency increased linearly (~2x) with sequence length from 128 to 2048 tokens when using a global KV cache, unlike the exponential increase without caching. Peak memory usage stayed similar for single-step tasks, but paged attention had minimal extra memory use only beyond 2048 tokens.

Conclusion: The authors open-source their implementation and suggest that this approach has significant implications for the future deployment of long-context models, offering better memory efficiency and manageable latency growth.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter severe memory inefficiencies during
long-context inference due to conventional handling of key-value (KV) caches.
In this work, we introduce a novel integration of PagedAttention with PyTorch's
FlexAttention, addressing internal fragmentation and inefficiencies associated
with monolithic KV cache allocations. Implemented within IBM's Foundation Model
Stack (FMS), our fused attention kernel efficiently gathers scattered KV data.
Our benchmarks on an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB) demonstrate significantly reduced
inference latency, growing only linearly (~2x) with sequence length from 128 to
2048 tokens when utilizing a global KV cache, compared to exponential latency
increases without caching. While peak memory usage remains largely unchanged
for single-step evaluations (dominated by model weights and activations), paged
attention causes minimal incremental memory usage, observable only at sequence
lengths exceeding 2048 tokens due to its power-of-two cache allocations. We
open-source the full implementation and discuss its implications for future
long-context model deployment.

Motivation: Limited data access is a major challenge in security and network applications, and while previous studies showed Transformers' potential for data synthesis, the synthesized data didn't effectively enhance model performance.

Method: Designing an efficient transformer-based model as a generative framework to create time-series data, focusing on generalizability across datasets and producing high-quality samples.

Result: The proposed model achieves SOTA results, demonstrating effectiveness in boosting existing and new ML workflows through synthesized data.

Conclusion: The transformer-based generative model effectively addresses data scarcity in security domains by producing high-quality, generalizable time-series data that enhances ML performance.

Abstract: Many security and network applications require having large datasets to train
the machine learning models. Limited data access is a well-known problem in the
security domain. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer models
to enlarge the size of data by synthesizing new samples, but the synthesized

design an efficient transformer-based model as a generative framework to
generate time-series data, that can be used to boost the performance of
existing and new ML workflows. Our new transformer model achieves the SOTA
results. We style our model to be generalizable and work across different

Abstract: We present JavelinGuard, a suite of low-cost, high-performance model

advances in transformer architectures, including compact BERT(Devlin et al.
2019) variants (e.g., ModernBERT (Warner et al. 2024)), allow us to build
highly accurate classifiers with as few as approximately 400M parameters that
achieve rapid inference speeds even on standard CPU hardware. We systematically
explore five progressively sophisticated transformer-based architectures:
Sharanga (baseline transformer classifier), Mahendra (enhanced
attention-weighted pooling with deeper heads), Vaishnava and Ashwina (hybrid
neural ensemble architectures), and Raudra (an advanced multi-task framework
with specialized loss functions). Our models are rigorously benchmarked across
nine diverse adversarial datasets, including popular sets like the NotInject
series, BIPIA, Garak, ImprovedLLM, ToxicChat, WildGuard, and our newly
introduced JavelinBench, specifically crafted to test generalization on
challenging borderline and hard-negative cases. Additionally, we compare our
architectures against leading open-source guardrail models as well as large
decoder-only LLMs such as gpt-4o, demonstrating superior cost-performance
trade-offs in terms of accuracy, and latency. Our findings reveal that while
Raudra's multi-task design offers the most robust performance overall, each
architecture presents unique trade-offs in speed, interpretability, and
resource requirements, guiding practitioners in selecting the optimal balance
of complexity and efficiency for real-world LLM security applications.

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is
a central challenge in interpretability research. Existing feature
interpretability methods often rely on strong assumptions about the structure
of representations that may not hold in practice. In this work, we introduce
InverseScope, an assumption-light and scalable framework for interpreting
neural activations via input inversion. Given a target activation, we define a
distribution over inputs that generate similar activations and analyze this
distribution to infer the encoded features. To address the inefficiency of
sampling in high-dimensional spaces, we propose a novel conditional generation
architecture that significantly improves sample efficiency compared to previous
methods. We further introduce a quantitative evaluation protocol that tests
interpretability hypotheses using feature consistency rate computed over the
sampled inputs. InverseScope scales inversion-based interpretability methods to
larger models and practical tasks, enabling systematic and quantitative
analysis of internal representations in real-world LLMs.

Abstract: Fractional-order differentiation has many characteristics different from

optimization algorithms of artificial neural networks to obtain better results.
However, due to insufficient theoretical research, at present, there is no
fractional-order matrix differentiation method that is perfectly compatible
with automatic differentiation (Autograd) technology. Therefore, we propose a
fractional-order matrix differentiation calculation method. This method is
introduced by the definition of the integer-order Jacobian matrix. We denote it
as fractional-order Jacobian matrix differentiation (${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$).
Through ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$, we can carry out the matrix-based
fractional-order chain rule. Based on the Linear module and the
fractional-order differentiation, we design the fractional-order Autograd
technology to enable the use of fractional-order differentiation in hidden
layers, thereby enhancing the practicality of fractional-order differentiation
in deep learning. In the experiment, according to the PyTorch framework, we
design fractional-order Linear (FLinear) and replace nn.Linear in the
multilayer perceptron with FLinear. Through the qualitative analysis of the
training set and validation set $Loss$, the quantitative analysis of the test
set indicators, and the analysis of time consumption and GPU memory usage
during model training, we verify the superior performance of ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims
to identify whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the
in-distribution (ID) training set, has garnered considerable attention in
security-sensitive fields. Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on
static graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high
variance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions
sensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from
the lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific
patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID
and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in
dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL).
Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via
Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural
network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution,
explaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution,
which is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware
augmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high
OOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and
mitigating score homogenization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for ensuring reliability in LLM deployments are too conservative, relying on rejecting uncertain outputs. There's a need for better tools to handle different uncertainty sources.

Method: Advocating for Bayesian Modeling of Experiments framework to systematically reason about uncertainty and determine its reducibility.

Result: The framework allows LLMs and users to take contextually suitable actions to address uncertainty, leading to more reliable and transparent systems.

Conclusion: Adopting Bayesian Modeling of Experiments can improve LLM reliability, especially in critical real-world applications, by supporting active resolution of uncertainty.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are highly interactive and extendable,
current approaches to ensure reliability in deployments remain mostly limited
to rejecting outputs with high uncertainty in order to avoid misinformation.
This conservative strategy reflects the current lack of tools to systematically
distinguish and respond to different sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we
advocate for the adoption of Bayesian Modeling of Experiments -- a framework
that provides a coherent foundation to reason about uncertainty and clarify the
reducibility of uncertainty -- for managing and proactively addressing
uncertainty that arises in LLM deployments. This framework enables LLMs and
their users to take contextually appropriate steps, such as requesting
clarification, retrieving external information, or refining inputs. By
supporting active resolution rather than passive avoidance, it opens the door
to more reliable, transparent, and broadly applicable LLM systems, particularly
in high-stakes, real-world settings.

Motivation: The motivation is to integrate neural methods into practical verification workflows for Lean, as hammers have proven effective in other proof assistants but are missing in Lean despite its popularity.

Method: The method involves developing a neural premise selection system that adapts to user-specific contexts and combines with symbolic proof search and reconstruction to create a hammer for Lean.

Result: LeanHammer solves 21% more goals than existing premise selectors and generalizes well across diverse domains.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between neural retrieval and symbolic reasoning, making formal verification more accessible for Lean users.

Abstract: Neural methods are transforming automated reasoning for proof assistants, yet
integrating these advances into practical verification workflows remains
challenging. Hammers are tools that interface with external automatic theorem
provers to automate tedious reasoning steps. They have dramatically improved
productivity in proof assistants, but the Lean proof assistant still does not
have a hammer despite its growing popularity. We present LeanHammer, the first
end-to-end domain-general hammer for Lean, built on a novel neural premise
selection system for a hammer in dependent type theory. Unlike existing Lean
premise selectors, our approach dynamically adapts to user-specific contexts
and combines with symbolic proof search and reconstruction to create a
practical hammer. With comprehensive evaluations, we show that our premise
selector enables LeanHammer to solve 21\% more goals relative to existing
premise selectors, and generalize well to diverse domains. Our work bridges the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning by utilizing prior data (like demonstrations) to guide exploration without directly aligning with reward maximization, which imitation learning objectives can hinder.

Method: The method involves using prior data to add noise to the policy, guiding exploration rather than enforcing specific actions through behavior cloning.

Result: The approach achieves up to 2-3x improvement over prior methods in seven simulated continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that prior data is more effective for guiding exploration in reinforcement learning, rather than as a direct imitation target, leading to better long-term performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of sample efficient reinforcement learning, where prior
data such as demonstrations are provided for initialization in lieu of a dense
reward signal. A natural approach is to incorporate an imitation learning
objective, either as regularization during training or to acquire a reference
policy. However, imitation learning objectives can ultimately degrade long-term
performance, as it does not directly align with reward maximization. In this
work, we propose to use prior data solely for guiding exploration via noise
added to the policy, sidestepping the need for explicit behavior cloning
constraints. The key insight in our framework, Data-Guided Noise (DGN), is that
demonstrations are most useful for identifying which actions should be
explored, rather than forcing the policy to take certain actions. Our approach
achieves up to 2-3x improvement over prior reinforcement learning from offline
data methods across seven simulated continuous control tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models like HMMs is computationally intensive due to enumerating the entire state space, including negligible states, leading to inefficiency and noise.

Method: The method involves using only the top-p states (most probable states with accumulated probability p) to reduce computational load and noise during inference.

Result: The error from using top-p states is bounded by p and the minimal mixing rate. Empirical results show at least an order of magnitude speedup with total variation distance error below 0.09.

Conclusion: By focusing on top-p states, the paper demonstrates a significant improvement in inference efficiency for HMMs with controlled error margins.

Abstract: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving
expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state
space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible
probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and
increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose
to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states,
i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the
error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called
minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical
evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of
magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for multiple devices to
cooperatively train a model. When applied in wireless networks, two issues
consistently affect the performance of FL, i.e., data heterogeneity of devices
and limited bandwidth. Many papers have investigated device scheduling
strategies considering the two issues. However, most of them recognize data
heterogeneity as a property of individual devices. In this paper, we prove that
the convergence speed of FL is affected by the sum of device-level and
sample-level collective gradient divergence (CGD). The device-level CGD refers
to the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of
the individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper
bounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total
number of samples scheduled for local update. To derive a tractable form of the
device-level CGD, we further consider a classification problem and transform it
into the weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) between the group distribution
and the global distribution. Then we propose FedCGD algorithm to minimize the
sum of multi-level CGDs by balancing WEMD and sampling variance, within
polynomial time. Simulation shows that the proposed strategy increases
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by up to 4.2\% while scheduling
41.8\% fewer devices, and flexibly switches between reducing WEMD and reducing
sampling variance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as effective and
promising approaches for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. Compared with
Full parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT), PEFT achieved comparable task performance
with a substantial reduction of trainable parameters, which largely saved the
training and storage costs. However, using the PEFT method requires considering
a vast design space, such as the type of PEFT modules and their insertion
layers. Inadequate configurations can lead to sub-optimal results. Conventional
solutions such as architectural search techniques, while effective, tend to
introduce substantial additional overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach, PrunePEFT, which formulates the PEFT strategy search as a pruning
problem and introduces a hybrid pruning strategy that capitalizes on the
sensitivity of pruning methods to different PEFT modules. This method extends
traditional pruning techniques by iteratively removing redundant or conflicting
PEFT modules, thereby optimizing the fine-tuned configuration. By efficiently
identifying the most relevant modules, our approach significantly reduces the
computational burden typically associated with architectural search processes,
making it a more scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large
pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on
high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their
efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective
strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different
trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that
formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an
explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance
Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from
different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition
stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal
sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the
subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE)
metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly
enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across
locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most
stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing
the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0. Our source code is available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in high-risk applications,
robust defenses against adversarial attacks and reliable performance guarantees
become paramount. Moreover, accuracy alone does not provide sufficient
assurance or reliable uncertainty estimates for these models. This study
advances adversarial training by leveraging principles from Conformal
Prediction. Specifically, we develop an adversarial attack method, termed OPSA
(OPtimal Size Attack), designed to reduce the efficiency of conformal
prediction at any significance level by maximizing model uncertainty without
requiring coverage guarantees. Correspondingly, we introduce OPSA-AT
(Adversarial Training), a defense strategy that integrates OPSA within a novel
conformal training paradigm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our OPSA
attack method induces greater uncertainty compared to baseline approaches for
various defenses. Conversely, our OPSA-AT defensive model significantly
enhances robustness not only against OPSA but also other adversarial attacks,
and maintains reliable prediction. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
this integrated approach for developing trustworthy and resilient deep learning
models for safety-critical domains. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new consistency distillation method for offline reinforcement learning that improves performance and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are effective in decision-making but slow. Consistency models could help, but existing methods have issues with demonstrations and complex training.

Method: A novel approach to consistency distillation that integrates reward optimization directly into the distillation process.

Result: Achieves 8.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art and 142x speedup in inference time compared to diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers higher performance and simpler training for offline reinforcement learning with single-step generation.

Abstract: Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making
tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While the
consistency model offers a potential solution, its applications to
decision-making often struggle with suboptimal demonstrations or rely on
complex concurrent training of multiple networks. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning
that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process.
Our method enables single-step generation while maintaining higher performance
and simpler training. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo benchmarks and
long horizon planning demonstrate that our approach can achieve an 8.7%
improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup
over diffusion counterparts in inference time.

TL;DR: This paper explores how incorporating high-level symbolic knowledge into Decentralized Multi-Agent RL (DMARL) can help overcome challenges like privacy, communication, and performance, while extending formal tools for policy compatibility and showing that symbolic knowledge about event sequences speeds up learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in DMARL, such as privacy constraints, communication limitations, and performance issues, by integrating high-level symbolic knowledge to improve collaboration among agents.

Method: The method involves extending formal tools for checking local policy compatibility with the team task and using symbolic knowledge about temporal event sequences to enhance learning efficiency.

Result: The result shows that symbolic knowledge about the temporal evolution of events in the environment significantly accelerates the learning process in DMARL.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can make decentralized training with theoretical guarantees more applicable to real-world scenarios, improving collaboration and learning efficiency in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a
single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems
require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For
example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of
a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL
(DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at
execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local
policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this
paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help
address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints,
communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend
the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the
team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in
more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge
about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly
expedite the learning process in DMARL.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling relational data but face
significant challenges in high-stakes domains due to unquantified uncertainty.
Conformal prediction (CP) offers statistical coverage guarantees, but existing
methods often produce overly conservative prediction intervals that fail to
account for graph heteroscedasticity and structural biases. While residual
reweighting CP variants address some of these limitations, they neglect graph
topology, cluster-specific uncertainties, and risk data leakage by reusing
training sets. To address these issues, we propose Residual Reweighted GNN
(RR-GNN), a framework designed to generate minimal prediction sets with
provable marginal coverage guarantees.
  RR-GNN introduces three major innovations to enhance prediction performance.
First, it employs Graph-Structured Mondrian CP to partition nodes or edges into
communities based on topological features, ensuring cluster-conditional
coverage that reflects heterogeneity. Second, it uses Residual-Adaptive
Nonconformity Scores by training a secondary GNN on a held-out calibration set
to estimate task-specific residuals, dynamically adjusting prediction intervals
according to node or edge uncertainty. Third, it adopts a Cross-Training
Protocol, which alternates the optimization of the primary GNN and the residual
predictor to prevent information leakage while maintaining graph dependencies.
We validate RR-GNN on 15 real-world graphs across diverse tasks, including node
classification, regression, and edge weight prediction. Compared to CP
baselines, RR-GNN achieves improved efficiency over state-of-the-art methods,
with no loss of coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness methods in ML lack formal guarantees for generalization to unseen data, and fairness loss overfitting is underexplored compared to prediction performance overfitting.

Method: The paper employs Efron-Stein inequality to develop a novel bounding technique for fairness generalization error, utilizing Mutual Information (MI) and Conditional Mutual Information (CMI).

Result: Empirical results show the bounds derived are tight and relevant across various fairness-aware learning algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides insights for designing algorithms that enhance fairness generalization.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in promoting fairness in high-stake applications
using machine learning models, existing methods often modify the training
process, such as through regularizers or other interventions, but lack formal
guarantees that fairness achieved during training will generalize to unseen
data. Although overfitting with respect to prediction performance has been
extensively studied, overfitting in terms of fairness loss has received far
less attention. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing
fairness generalization error through an information-theoretic lens. Our novel
bounding technique is based on Efron-Stein inequality, which allows us to
derive tight information-theoretic fairness generalization bounds with both
Mutual Information (MI) and Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). Our empirical
results validate the tightness and practical relevance of these bounds across
diverse fairness-aware learning algorithms. Our framework offers valuable
insights to guide the design of algorithms improving fairness generalization.

Motivation: Type 1 Diabetes requires continuous monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events, but deploying predictive models on wearable devices is challenging due to computational and memory constraints.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in glucose prediction and adverse event detection on OhioT1DM and DiaTrend datasets.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, offering a reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous
monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous
glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive
models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory
constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential
Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating
the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential
processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term
dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized
for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced
loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic
events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend,
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning
traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that
require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before
acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new
information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this
work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of
test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable
running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic
re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling
dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even
prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task
success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI
(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.
Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data
web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI
enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results
establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling
per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of AI alignment by developing a conceptual framework that distinguishes alignment aims, scope, and constituency, offering a structured approach for practical and philosophical integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure AI agents are safe and adhere to normative expectations as they operate beyond controlled environments, addressing the urgent interdisciplinary challenge.

Method: The method involves creating a structured conceptual framework with a taxonomy that differentiates alignment aim, scope, and constituency.

Result: The result is a taxonomy that clarifies multiple legitimate alignment configurations, aiding integration across AI Safety, Alignment, and Ethics domains.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the structural framework provides a foundation for understanding AI alignment, making it easier to clarify what it means for an agent to be aligned in a comprehensive sense.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI research make it increasingly plausible that artificial
agents with consequential real-world impact will soon operate beyond tightly
controlled environments. Ensuring that these agents are not only safe but that
they adhere to broader normative expectations is thus an urgent
interdisciplinary challenge. Multiple fields -- notably AI Safety, AI
Alignment, and Machine Ethics -- claim to contribute to this task. However, the
conceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague,
leaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.
  To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework
for understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals,
we introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality,
legality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual
vs. collective). This structural approach reveals multiple legitimate alignment
configurations, providing a foundation for practical and philosophical
integration across domains, and clarifying what it might mean for an agent to
be aligned all-things-considered.

Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations.

institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly
vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses --
always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity
swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side
"AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize various
fields, including code development, robotics, finance, and education, due to
their extensive prior knowledge and rapid advancements. This paper investigates
how LLMs can be leveraged in engineering education. Specifically, we benchmark
the capabilities of different LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama
3 70B, in assessing homework for an undergraduate-level circuit analysis
course. We have developed a novel dataset consisting of official reference
solutions and real student solutions to problems from various topics in circuit
analysis. To overcome the limitations of image recognition in current
state-of-the-art LLMs, the solutions in the dataset are converted to LaTeX
format. Using this dataset, a prompt template is designed to test five metrics
of student solutions: completeness, method, final answer, arithmetic error, and
units. The results show that GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B perform significantly
better than GPT-3.5 Turbo across all five metrics, with GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B
each having distinct advantages in different evaluation aspects. Additionally,
we present insights into the limitations of current LLMs in several aspects of
circuit analysis. Given the paramount importance of ensuring reliability in
LLM-generated homework assessment to avoid misleading students, our results
establish benchmarks and offer valuable insights for the development of a
reliable, personalized tutor for circuit analysis -- a focus of our future
work. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation methods can be generalized to a
broader range of courses for engineering education in the future.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) follow International Humanitarian Law (IHL) by testing their ability to refuse unlawful requests. While most models rejected such prompts, the clarity and consistency of their responses varied. The study found that adding a standardized safety prompt improved the quality of explanations in refusals, showing that simple interventions can make LLMs safer and more transparent. However, complex prompts with technical terms or code still posed challenges, suggesting areas for further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to understand how well large language models (LLMs) align with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and to improve their ability to refuse unlawful requests in a clear and helpful manner.

Method: The method involved evaluating eight leading LLMs on their capacity to reject prompts that violate IHL, with an emphasis on the helpfulness of their refusals. The researchers also tested the impact of a standardized system-level safety prompt on the quality of explanations provided in refusals.

Result: Most LLMs were able to reject unlawful requests, but the clarity and consistency of their responses differed. Implementing a standardized safety prompt significantly enhanced the quality of explanatory refusals in many models, indicating that lightweight interventions can be effective. However, complex prompts involving technical language or code showed persistent vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that while standardized safety prompts improve LLMs' ability to explain refusals, there are still challenges with complex or technical prompts. The study contributes to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and proposes a benchmark for evaluating IHL compliance in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their
alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood.
This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that
explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how
clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models
rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses
varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or
safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce
ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt
significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within
refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight
interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or
requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute
to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a
benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL.

knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to
reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated
with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for
expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We
analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use
pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal
executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and
predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach
and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge
institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when
controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows
us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the
shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs
offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional
measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for
when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.

Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the
labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency,
and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the
evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel
auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to
automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological
capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to
capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a
shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using
this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S.
Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain
workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks
spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological
capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light"
Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.
This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.
Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse
HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for
human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent
integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from
information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the
importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing
workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Generative Minds (GenMinds) and RECAP framework to improve cognitive reasoning in LLM agents for more accurate social simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability, making them unreliable for analyzing human reasoning and responses.

Method: Introduce GenMinds, a conceptual modeling paradigm from cognitive science, and RECAP, a benchmark for evaluating reasoning fidelity through causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency.

Result: The proposed methods advance the shift from surface-level mimicry to agents that simulate thought, not just language, in social simulations.

Conclusion: GenMinds and RECAP contribute to creating more reliable generative agents for studying human behavior in social contexts.

Abstract: Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more
than generating plausible behavior -- it demands cognitively grounded reasoning
that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly
used to emulate individual and group behavior -- primarily through prompting
and supervised fine-tuning. Yet they often lack internal coherence, causal
reasoning, and belief traceability -- making them unreliable for analyzing how
people reason, deliberate, or respond to interventions.
  To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds
(GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief
representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the
RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess
reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and
intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from
surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought -- not just
language -- for social simulations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: MEMS gyroscopes play a critical role in inertial navigation and motion
control applications but typically suffer from a fundamental trade-off between
measurement range and noise performance. Existing hardware-based solutions
aimed at mitigating this issue introduce additional complexity, cost, and
scalability challenges. Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise
reduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making
them difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental
trade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of
Experts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework
specifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and
noise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction
Expert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing
saturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch
complementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise
reduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the
appropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive
standard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this
gap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source
benchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified
evaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods. We evaluate MoE-Gyro using our
proposed ISEBench, demonstrating that our framework significantly extends the
measurable range from 450 deg/s to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by
98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the
long-standing trade-off in inertial sensing.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve network performance and energy efficiency using RISs and RL, while addressing the critical need for fair communication where all UEs receive adequate signal strength without some being deprived due to insufficient power.

Method: The paper proposes a novel method for creating an efficient and fair duplex RIS-RL system, examining the fairness properties of prior work to inform their approach.

Result: The experimental work and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving efficient and fair RIS-RL systems for multiple UEs.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of integrating RISs with RL to optimize network performance and energy efficiency while ensuring fairness, and the release of code and datasets is intended to support further research in this area.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements
that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance
beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties.
They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via
optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it
is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must
ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate
strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power.
In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of
previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient
and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and
discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission losses (TLs) is essential to
assess the performance of the global International Monitoring System infrasound
network. Among existing propagation modeling tools, parabolic equation (PE)
method enables TLs to be finely modeled, but its computational cost does not
allow exploration of a large parameter space for operational monitoring
applications. To reduce computation times, Brissaud et al. 2023 explored the
potential of convolutional neural networks trained on a large set of regionally
simulated wavefields (< 1000 km from the source) to predict TLs with negligible
computation times compared to PE simulations. However, this method struggles in
unfavorable initial wind conditions, especially at high frequencies, and causal
issues with winds at large distances from the source affecting ground TLs close
to the source. In this study, we have developed an optimized convolutional
network designed to minimize prediction errors while predicting TLs from
globally simulated combined temperature and wind fields spanning over
propagation ranges of 4000 km. Our approach enhances the previously proposed
one by implementing key optimizations that improve the overall architecture
performance. The implemented model predicts TLs with an average error of 8.6 dB
in the whole frequency band (0.1-3.2 Hz) and explored realistic atmospheric
scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission loss is essential for evaluating
the performance of the International Monitoring System, enabling the effective
design and maintenance of infrasound stations to support compliance of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. State-of-the-art propagation modeling
tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models.
However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter
space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies
made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss
predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric
models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of
temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long range
propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and
temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km
altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the neural
network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture
spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric
models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an
average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and
provides epistemic and data-related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on
the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its
prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included
in the training. This represents a significant step towards near real-time
assessment of International Monitoring System detection thresholds of explosive

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has
significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of
radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques
struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by
non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization
accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the
development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing
localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods
often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and
inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based
localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and
improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to
learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural
channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison
dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method
outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization
accuracy, even in NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by
several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously
reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical
fingerprinting methods.

Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living
with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without
continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable
early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life
for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark
machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in
community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A
new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was
introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine
learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem
formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular
sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly
detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the
Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly
available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,
comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most
effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the
current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.
Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation
history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720
and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work
presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques
for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using
privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and
efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals
through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing
hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats.
The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering,
and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis.
In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean,
variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers,
including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and
LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images
using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and
Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN
architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest
performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the
image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost
yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this
task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to
capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to
image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may
benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies
across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

Abstract: Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing
privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key
criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to
verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent
spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space,
making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of
watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and
temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for
multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and
spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark
directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is
the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction
error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to
detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time
series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively
evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark
detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5
datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that
TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in
correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining
consistently detectable.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text
provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI
systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions
output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random
side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens.
LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -
such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this
paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is
to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to
maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of
generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks:
HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully
trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be
applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine
the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks,
demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with
minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy
regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections
between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language model safety evaluations miss covert attacks where attackers request help on small, non-harmful tasks across many queries, making it hard to detect. The paper aims to address this gap by developing a benchmark to evaluate defenses against such strategies.

Method: The authors developed a data generation pipeline called Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses (BSD) to automate evaluations of covert attacks and corresponding defenses. They curate two new datasets that are consistently refused by advanced models and challenging for weaker models.

Result: The evaluations show that decomposition attacks are effective in enabling misuse, and stateful defenses can counteract these attacks effectively.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that stateful defenses are a promising approach to mitigate the risk of decomposition attacks in language models, emphasizing the need for better evaluation benchmarks like BSD.

Abstract: Existing language model safety evaluations focus on overt attacks and
low-stakes tasks. Realistic attackers can subvert current safeguards by
requesting help on small, benign-seeming tasks across many independent queries.
Because individual queries do not appear harmful, the attack is hard to
{detect}. However, when combined, these fragments uplift misuse by helping the
attacker complete hard and dangerous tasks. Toward identifying defenses against
such strategies, we develop Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses (BSD), a data
generation pipeline that automates evaluations of covert attacks and
corresponding defenses. Using this pipeline, we curate two new datasets that
are consistently refused by frontier models and are too difficult for weaker
open-weight models. Our evaluations indicate that decomposition attacks are
effective misuse enablers, and highlight stateful defenses as a countermeasure.

### [550] [Auditing Black-Box LLM APIs with a Rank-Based Uniformity Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06975)
*Xiaoyuan Zhu,Yaowen Ye,Tianyi Qiu,Hanlin Zhu,Sijun Tan,Ajraf Mannan,Jonathan Michala,Raluca Ada Popa,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rank-based uniformity test to verify if a black-box LLM matches an authentic model's behavior without needing access to weights or logits, offering accuracy and robustness against adversarial providers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users interact with LLMs via opaque APIs, which can be manipulated by providers to reduce costs or alter behavior, leading to performance degradation and safety issues. Detecting these substitutions is challenging due to lack of access to model details.

Method: A rank-based uniformity test is proposed to check behavioral equality between the black-box LLM and a locally deployed authentic model, requiring no model weights or output logits.

Result: The method demonstrates superior statistical power in detecting substitutions across various threat scenarios like quantization, harmful fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, even with limited query budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed test is effective, efficient, and robust, providing a reliable way to ensure LLMs via APIs behave as expected without exposing vulnerabilities to adversarial providers.

Abstract: As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs),
users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into
the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API
providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can
degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is
difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even
output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test
that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally
deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids
detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that
reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate
the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful
fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it
consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under
constrained query budgets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HauntAttack, a black-box attack framework that embeds harmful instructions into reasoning questions, revealing safety vulnerabilities in Large Reasoning Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the safety vulnerabilities in Large Reasoning Models when reasoning is entangled with harmfulness.

Method: Introduce HauntAttack, a framework that embeds harmful instructions into reasoning questions by substituting original conditions, creating a reasoning pathway leading to unsafe outputs.

Result: Experiments on multiple LRMs show significant safety vulnerabilities, despite their advanced capabilities.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the security of LRMs and highlights the need for addressing safety issues in reasoning processes.

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and
reasoning tasks, showcasing exceptional capabilities. However, the enhancement
of reasoning abilities and the exposure of their internal reasoning processes
introduce new safety vulnerabilities. One intriguing concern is: when reasoning
is strongly entangled with harmfulness, what safety-reasoning trade-off do LRMs
exhibit? To address this issue, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and
general-purpose black-box attack framework that systematically embeds harmful
instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we treat reasoning
questions as carriers and substitute one of their original conditions with a
harmful instruction. This process creates a reasoning pathway in which the
model is guided step by step toward generating unsafe outputs. Based on
HauntAttack, we conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple LRMs. Our results
reveal that even the most advanced LRMs exhibit significant safety
vulnerabilities. Additionally, we perform a detailed analysis of different
models, various types of harmful instructions, and model output patterns,
providing valuable insights into the security of LRMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JailFlipBench to assess implicit harm risks in LLMs, highlighting the need for broader safety evaluations beyond traditional jailbreak attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical risk of incorrect answers to harmless inputs in LLMs, which can cause real-world harm but are overlooked by existing jailbreak attack evaluations.

Method: Proposes JailFlipBench, a benchmark for implicit harm with multiple scenarios and metrics, and develops initial attack methodologies to evaluate LLMs.

Result: Demonstrates that implicit harm poses immediate real-world risks, showing the limitations of current LLM safety assessments.

Conclusion: Calls for expanded safety evaluations and alignment efforts for LLMs, beyond conventional jailbreak paradigms, to mitigate implicit harm risks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about their security. While jailbreak attacks
highlight failures under overtly harmful queries, they overlook a critical
risk: incorrectly answering harmless-looking inputs can be dangerous and cause
real-world harm (Implicit Harm). We systematically reformulate the LLM risk
landscape through a structured quadrant perspective based on output factuality
and input harmlessness, uncovering an overlooked high-risk region. To
investigate this gap, we propose JailFlipBench, a benchmark aims to capture
implicit harm, spanning single-modal, multimodal, and factual extension
scenarios with diverse evaluation metrics. We further develop initial JailFlip
attack methodologies and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple
open-source and black-box LLMs, show that implicit harm present immediate and
urgent real-world risks, calling for broader LLM safety assessments and
alignment beyond conventional jailbreak paradigms.

Abstract: The rapid global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has established electric
vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) as a critical component of smart grid
infrastructure. While essential for ensuring reliable energy delivery and
accessibility, EVSE systems face significant cybersecurity challenges,
including network reconnaissance, backdoor intrusions, and distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These emerging threats, driven by the
interconnected and autonomous nature of EVSE, require innovative and adaptive
security mechanisms that go beyond traditional intrusion detection systems
(IDS). Existing approaches, whether network-based or host-based, often fail to
detect sophisticated and targeted attacks specifically crafted to exploit new
vulnerabilities in EVSE infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel intrusion
detection framework that leverages multimodal data sources, including network
traffic and kernel events, to identify complex attack patterns. The framework
employs a distributed learning approach, enabling collaborative intelligence
across EVSE stations while preserving data privacy through federated learning.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing solutions, achieving a detection rate above 98% and a precision rate
exceeding 97% in decentralized environments. This solution addresses the
evolving challenges of EVSE security, offering a scalable and privacypreserving
response to advanced cyber threats

Abstract: Smart contracts, integral to blockchain ecosystems, enable decentralized
applications to execute predefined operations without intermediaries. Their
ability to enforce trustless interactions has made them a core component of
platforms such as Ethereum. Vulnerabilities such as numerical overflows,
reentrancy attacks, and improper access permissions have led to the loss of
millions of dollars throughout the blockchain and smart contract sector.
Traditional smart contract auditing techniques such as manual code reviews and
formal verification face limitations in scalability, automation, and
adaptability to evolving development patterns. As a result, AI-based solutions
have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the ability to learn complex
patterns, detect subtle flaws, and provide scalable security assurances. This
paper examines novel AI-driven techniques for vulnerability detection in smart
contracts, focusing on machine learning, deep learning, graph neural networks,
and transformer-based models. This paper analyzes how each technique represents
code, processes semantic information, and responds to real world vulnerability
classes. We also compare their strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy,
interpretability, computational overhead, and real time applicability. Lastly,
it highlights open challenges and future opportunities for advancing this
domain.

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is a widely adopted technique, valued for its
effectiveness in protecting the privacy of task-specific datasets, making it a
critical tool for large language models. However, its effectiveness in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains uncertain. Applying
Differential Privacy (DP) inherently introduces substantial computation
overhead, a concern particularly relevant for MLLMs which process extensive
textual and visual data. Furthermore, a critical challenge of DP is that the
injected noise, necessary for privacy, scales with parameter dimensionality,
leading to pronounced model degradation; This trade-off between privacy and
utility complicates the application of Differential Privacy (DP) to complex
architectures like MLLMs. To address these, we propose Dual-Priv Pruning, a
framework that employs two complementary pruning mechanisms for DP fine-tuning
in MLLMs: (i) visual token pruning to reduce input dimensionality by removing
redundant visual information, and (ii) gradient-update pruning during the DP
optimization process. This second mechanism selectively prunes parameter
updates based on the magnitude of noisy gradients, aiming to mitigate noise
impact and improve utility. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
competitive results with minimal performance degradation. In terms of
computational efficiency, our approach consistently utilizes less memory than
standard DP-SGD. While requiring only 1.74% more memory than zeroth-order
methods which suffer from severe performance issues on A100 GPUs, our method
demonstrates leading memory efficiency on H20 GPUs. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to explore DP fine-tuning in MLLMs. Our code is
coming soon.

Abstract: Web-use agents are rapidly being deployed to automate complex web tasks,
operating with extensive browser capabilities including multi-tab navigation,
DOM manipulation, JavaScript execution and authenticated session access.
However, these powerful capabilities create a critical and previously
unexplored attack surface. This paper demonstrates how attackers can exploit
web-use agents' high-privilege capabilities by embedding malicious content in
web pages such as comments, reviews, or advertisements that agents encounter
during legitimate browsing tasks. In addition, we introduce the task-aligned
injection technique that frame malicious commands as helpful task guidance
rather than obvious attacks. This technique exploiting fundamental limitations
in LLMs' contextual reasoning: agents struggle in maintaining coherent
contextual awareness and fail to detect when seemingly helpful web content
contains steering attempts that deviate from their original task goal. Through
systematic evaluation of four popular agents (OpenAI Operator, Browser Use, Do
Browser, OpenOperator), we demonstrate nine payload types that compromise
confidentiality, integrity, and availability, including unauthorized camera
activation, user impersonation, local file exfiltration, password leakage, and
denial of service, with validation across multiple LLMs achieving success rates
of 80%-100%. These payloads succeed across agents with built-in safety
mechanisms, requiring only the ability to post content on public websites,
creating unprecedented risks given the ease of exploitation combined with
agents' high-privilege access. To address this attack, we propose comprehensive
mitigation strategies including oversight mechanisms, execution constraints,
and task-aware reasoning techniques, providing practical directions for secure
development and deployment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms has enabled a wide
range of mission-critical applications, but also exposes UAV networks to severe
Denial-of-Service (DoS) threats due to their open wireless environment, dynamic
topology, and resource constraints. Traditional static or centralized defense
mechanisms are often inadequate for such dynamic and distributed scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework
for proactive and adaptive DoS mitigation in UAV swarm networks. Specifically,
we design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader
switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent
flexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network
resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the distributed,
resource-constrained, and uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV
is equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions
based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy
gradient-based FMADRL algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their defense
policies via reward-weighted aggregation, enabling distributed learning without
sharing raw data and thus reducing communication overhead. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack
mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and
decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,
respectively, while maintaining robust mission continuity under various DoS
attack strategies.

Abstract: Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely employed, and its usage is
growing exponentially because it facilitates remote monitoring, predictive
maintenance, and data-driven decision making, especially in the healthcare and
industrial sectors. However, IoT devices remain vulnerable due to their
resource constraints and difficulty in applying security patches. Consequently,
various cybersecurity attacks are reported daily, such as Denial of Service,
particularly in IoT-driven solutions. Most attack detection methodologies are
based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which can detect attack patterns.
However, the focus is more on identification rather than considering the impact
of ML algorithms on computational resources. This paper proposes a green
methodology to identify IoT malware networking attacks based on flow
privacy-preserving statistical features. In particular, the hyperparameters of
three tree-based models -- Decision Trees, Random Forest and Extra-Trees -- are
optimized based on energy consumption and test-time performance in terms of
Matthew's Correlation Coefficient. Our results show that models maintain high
performance and detection accuracy while consistently reducing power usage in
terms of watt-hours (Wh). This suggests that on-premise ML-based Intrusion
Detection Systems are suitable for IoT and other resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Power-to-Gas (P2G) technologies gain recognition for enabling the integration
of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, into electricity grids.
However, determining the most cost-effective operation of these systems is
complex due to the volatile nature of renewable energy, electricity prices, and
loads. Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing
energy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of
converting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of
energy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face
difficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation.
Previous research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the
energy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of
P2G.
  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be
applied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and
gas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex
case studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep
Q-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to
enhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts,
implementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost
calculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards. Our
findings indicate that while DRL initially struggles with the complex
decision-making required for P2G system operation, the adjustments we propose
significantly improve its capability to devise cost-effective operation
strategies, thereby unlocking the potential for long-term energy storage in P2G
technologies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothetical hybrid control framework for
port-Hamiltonian (p$\mathcal{H}$) systems, employing a dynamic decomposition
based on Data-Assisted Control (DAC). The system's evolution is split into two
parts with fixed topology: Right-Hand Side (RHS)- an intrinsic Hamiltonian flow
handling worst-case parametric uncertainties, and Left-Hand Side (LHS)- a
dissipative/input flow addressing both structural and parametric uncertainties.
A virtual port variable $\Pi$ serves as the interface between these two
components. A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow,
determining a desired port control value $\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for
providing optimal policy in mapping $\Pi_c$ to the actual system input. This
hybrid approach effectively manages RHS uncertainties while preserving the
system's inherent structure. Key advantages include adjustable performance via
LHS controller parameters, enhanced AI explainability and interpretability
through the port variable $\Pi$, the ability to guarantee safety and state
attainability with hard/soft constraints, reduced complexity in learning
hypothesis classes compared to end-to-end solutions, and improved
state/parameter estimation using LHS prior knowledge and system Hamiltonian to
address partial observability. The paper details the p$\mathcal{H}$
formulation, derives the decomposition, and presents the modular controller
architecture. Beyond design, crucial aspects of stability and robustness
analysis and synthesis are investigated, paving the way for deeper theoretical
investigations. An application example, a pendulum with nonlinear dynamics, is
simulated to demonstrate the approach's empirical and phenomenological benefits
for future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety in multi-agent systems is hard, especially without central control. Existing methods might be too cautious or not robust enough.

Method: Uses CBFs via value functions and centralized risk conditions with exponential operators. Develops two distributed strategies: worst-case anticipation and proximity to a safe policy.

Result: The approach works well in tests, keeping systems safe without being too strict.

Conclusion: The method is effective for safe multi-agent systems, balancing safety and performance.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge,
particularly in settings where centralized coordination is impractical. In this
work, we propose a novel risk-sensitive safety filter for discrete-time
multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics that leverages control barrier
functions (CBFs) defined through value functions. Our approach relies on
centralized risk-sensitive safety conditions based on exponential risk
operators to ensure robustness against model uncertainties. We introduce a
distributed formulation of the safety filter by deriving two alternative
strategies: one based on worst-case anticipation and another on proximity to a
known safe policy. By allowing agents to switch between strategies, feasibility
can be ensured. Through detailed numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in maintaining safety without being overly
conservative.

Abstract: Quantum circuits consist of gates applied to qubits. Current quantum hardware
platforms impose connectivity restrictions on binary CX gates. Hence, Layout
Synthesis is an important step to transpile quantum circuits before they can be
executed. Since CX gates are noisy, it is important to reduce the CX count or
CX depth of the mapped circuits.
  We provide a new and efficient encoding of Quantum-circuit Layout Synthesis
in SAT. Previous SAT encodings focused on gate count and CX-gate count. Our
encoding instead guarantees that we find mapped circuits with minimal circuit
depth or minimal CX-gate depth. We use incremental SAT solving and parallel
plans for an efficient encoding. This results in speedups of more than 10-100x
compared to OLSQ2, which guarantees depth-optimality. But minimizing depth
still takes more time than minimizing gate count with Q-Synth.
  We correlate the noise reduction achieved by simulating circuits after
(CX)-count and (CX)-depth reduction. We find that minimizing for CX-count
correlates better with reducing noise than minimizing for CX-depth. However,
taking into account both CX-count and CX-depth provides the best noise
reduction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between natural intelligence and AI by understanding how NI's constraints lead to efficient and adaptable systems, which can inform the development of better artificial systems.

Method: The paper uses theoretical analysis and reviews existing research on neural constraints, chaotic itinerancy, reservoir computing, and developmental perspectives to support its arguments.

Result: The results show that constraints in NI promote efficient learning and processing, and that adopting similar constraints in AI can lead to more efficient and interpretable systems.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that AI should incorporate 'less is more' principles, such as energy constraints and real-world interaction, to develop more efficient and biologically grounded systems.

Abstract: Natural intelligence (NI) consistently achieves more with less. Infants learn
language, develop abstract concepts, and acquire sensorimotor skills from
sparse data, all within tight neural and energy limits. In contrast, today's AI
relies on virtually unlimited computational power, energy, and data to reach
high performance. This paper argues that constraints in NI are paradoxically
catalysts for efficiency, adaptability, and creativity. We first show how
limited neural bandwidth promotes concise codes that still capture complex
patterns. Spiking neurons, hierarchical structures, and symbolic-like
representations emerge naturally from bandwidth constraints, enabling robust
generalization. Next, we discuss chaotic itinerancy, illustrating how the brain
transits among transient attractors to flexibly retrieve memories and manage
uncertainty. We then highlight reservoir computing, where random projections
facilitate rapid generalization from small datasets. Drawing on developmental
perspectives, we emphasize how intrinsic motivation, along with responsive
social environments, drives infant language learning and discovery of meaning.
Such active, embodied processes are largely absent in current AI. Finally, we
suggest that adopting 'less is more' principles -- energy constraints,
parsimonious architectures, and real-world interaction -- can foster the
emergence of more efficient, interpretable, and biologically grounded
artificial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for Stable Diffusion have issues with underfitting (not capturing subject identity) and overfitting (memorizing subject images and reducing background diversity).

Method: The authors propose a prior consistency regularization loss and a subject consistency regularization loss to address underfitting and overfitting during fine-tuning of diffusion models.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed losses preserve subject identity and enhance image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in CLIP scores, background variation, and visual quality.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that incorporating the two consistency losses into fine-tuning improves the performance of Stable Diffusion for subject-driven image synthesis.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by
adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However,
existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where
the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it
memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion
fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the
predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent
with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject
consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to
multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject
identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity
but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP
scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

Abstract: Faithfully reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos

Previous methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a

TL;DR: This paper improves novel view synthesis by leveraging repetitive elements in 3D scenes, enhancing both geometry and appearance in low-quality areas due to poor coverage and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced novel view synthesis, but they struggle with low-quality renderings of unseen and occluded parts when training views are insufficient.

Method: The paper proposes a method to segment repeated instances in 3DGS reconstructions, register them, and share information among instances while accounting for appearance variations.

Result: The method shows significant improvements in novel view synthesis quality across various synthetic and real scenes with repetitive elements.

Conclusion: Leveraging repetitive elements in 3D scenes can effectively enhance the reconstruction of low-quality regions in novel view synthesis, improving both geometry and appearance consistency.

Abstract: We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis.
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly
improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts
remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key
observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We
propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of
low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose
a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction,
registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances.
Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance
variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of
synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a
substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for
high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields
such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive
algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices
remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper
presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.
First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of
common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve
this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses
shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,
effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by
identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,
we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent
blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for
costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to
improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization
and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing
array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we
introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and
Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves
rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy
savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We
plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.

Abstract: We present HOI-PAGE, a new approach to synthesizing 4D human-object
interactions (HOIs) from text prompts in a zero-shot fashion, driven by
part-level affordance reasoning. In contrast to prior works that focus on
global, whole body-object motion for 4D HOI synthesis, we observe that
generating realistic and diverse HOIs requires a finer-grained understanding --
at the level of how human body parts engage with object parts. We thus
introduce Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs), a structured HOI representation
distilled from large language models (LLMs) that encodes fine-grained part
information along with contact relations. We then use these PAGs to guide a
three-stage synthesis: first, decomposing input 3D objects into geometric
parts; then, generating reference HOI videos from text prompts, from which we
extract part-based motion constraints; finally, optimizing for 4D HOI motion
sequences that not only mimic the reference dynamics but also satisfy
part-level contact constraints. Extensive experiments show that our approach is
flexible and capable of generating complex multi-object or multi-person
interaction sequences, with significantly improved realism and text alignment
for zero-shot 4D HOI generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved remarkable success in reconstructing both
static and dynamic 3D scenes. However, in a scene represented by 3D Gaussian
primitives, interactions between objects suffer from inaccurate 3D
segmentation, imprecise deformation among different materials, and severe
rendering artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIG:
Physically-Based Multi-Material Interaction with 3D Gaussians, a novel approach
that combines 3D object segmentation with the simulation of interacting objects
in high precision. Firstly, our method facilitates fast and accurate mapping
from 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians, enabling precise 3D object-level segmentation.
Secondly, we assign unique physical properties to correspondingly segmented
objects within the scene for multi-material coupled interactions. Finally, we
have successfully embedded constraint scales into deformation gradients,
specifically clamping the scaling and rotation properties of the Gaussian
primitives to eliminate artifacts and achieve geometric fidelity and visual
consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of visual quality, but also
opens up new directions and pipelines for the field of physically realistic
scene generation.

Motivation: Current 3DGS methods are limited by input resolution, unable to produce finer details than training data. Need for a practical, real-time solution for interactive applications.

Method: Introduces a lightweight generative model with Hessian-assisted sampling to predict and refine 3D Gaussians in critical regions.

Result: Improves geometric accuracy and rendering quality, achieves real-time performance (0.015s per inference on consumer GPU).

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D scene enhancement, offering efficient and effective method for interactive use.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric
fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution.
Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution,
producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are
present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a
lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians
where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling
strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit
from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally
intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time
(0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for
interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D

Abstract: Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve
high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the
time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian
neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting
rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper,
we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general
pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS
representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary
techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that
identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene
reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that
improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses.
Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters
Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation
per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our
techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by
$7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset.
SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on
the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be
integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.

Abstract: We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior
knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D
data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent
spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through
trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or
a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then
transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent
code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the
mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code
into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned
to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained
entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The
Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D
encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different
formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments
demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for
textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while
maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only
incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve
training object-specific networks to compress an object.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify the training process of neural networks by avoiding complex analytical calculations of weights and thresholds, making it more adaptable and scalable for larger recognition tasks.

Method: The method involves restructuring neural networks originally designed with metric recognition, allowing them to be trained using classical algorithms through image pair recognition, eliminating the need for analytical weight determination.

Result: The resulting networks offer simplicity, reliability in training, scalability with large image datasets, and the ability to expand recognizable classes without altering existing weights and thresholds.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that the transformed networks provide significant advantages in architecture simplicity, training efficiency, and scalability, making them a promising approach for expanding recognition tasks without reconfiguring previous parameters.

Abstract: Neural networks based on metric recognition methods have a strictly
determined architecture. Number of neurons, connections, as well as weights and
thresholds values are calculated analytically, based on the initial conditions
of tasks: number of recognizable classes, number of samples, metric expressions
used. This paper discusses the possibility of transforming these networks in
order to apply classical learning algorithms to them without using analytical
expressions that calculate weight values. In the received network, training is
carried out by recognizing images in pairs. This approach simplifies the
learning process and easily allows to expand the neural network by adding new
images to the recognition task. The advantages of these networks, including
such as: 1) network architecture simplicity and transparency; 2) training
simplicity and reliability; 3) the possibility of using a large number of
images in the recognition problem using a neural network; 4) a consistent
increase in the number of recognizable classes without changing the previous
values of weights and thresholds.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized model of energy cooperation between
microgrids, in which decisions are made locally, at the level of the microgrid
community. Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk
or Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and
its role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and
buying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual
in the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that
encodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids.
The population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators.
Recombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation
is applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The
evaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that
considers the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community
level, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the
degradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated
scenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds,
to reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of
microgrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the
100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the
effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the
individual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization poses a significant computational challenge due to its
nested structure, where each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a
corresponding lower-level problem. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are
effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands
remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous
unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and
transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a
novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies
and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a
contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired
upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a
reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and
adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality.
Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show
that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving --
or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable
strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more
scalable bilevel optimization.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain learns may be informed by studying biologically
plausible learning rules. These rules, often approximating gradient descent
learning to respect biological constraints such as locality, must meet two
critical criteria to be considered an appropriate brain model: (1) good
neuroscience task performance and (2) alignment with neural recordings. While
extensive research has assessed the first criterion, the second remains
underexamined. Employing methods such as Procrustes analysis on well-known
neuroscience datasets, this study demonstrates the existence of a biologically
plausible learning rule -- namely e-prop, which is based on gradient truncation
and has demonstrated versatility across a wide range of tasks -- that can
achieve neural data similarity comparable to Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) when matched for task accuracy. Our findings also reveal that model
architecture and initial conditions can play a more significant role in
determining neural similarity than the specific learning rule. Furthermore, we
observe that BPTT-trained models and their biologically plausible counterparts
exhibit similar dynamical properties at comparable accuracies. These results
underscore the substantial progress made in developing biologically plausible
learning rules, highlighting their potential to achieve both competitive task
performance and neural data similarity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust and versatile approach to analyze and solve complex tensor estimation problems, providing critical insights into statistical performance and thresholds for new applications in high-dimensional data analysis.

Abstract: This paper provides a unified framework for analyzing tensor estimation

the mutual information (equivalently, the free energy) as well as the minimum
mean-squared error in the Bayes-optimal setting. We then apply this framework
to derive sharp characterizations of statistical thresholds for two novel
scenarios: (1) tensor estimation in heteroskedastic noise that is independent
but not identically distributed, and (2) higher-order assignment problems,
where the goal is to recover an unknown permutation from tensor-valued
observations.

operator architectures in learning the functional relationships between the
one-body density profile $\rho(x)$, the one-body direct correlation function
$c_1(x)$, and the external potential $V_{ext}(x)$ of inhomogeneous
one-dimensional (1D) hard-rod fluids, using training data generated from
analytical solutions of the underlying statistical-mechanical model. We
compared their performance in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss in
establishing the functional relationships as well as in predicting the excess
free energy across two test sets: (1) a group test set generated via random
cross-validation (CV) to assess interpolation capability, and (2) a newly
constructed dataset for leave-one-group CV to evaluate extrapolation
performance. Our results show that FNO achieves the most accurate predictions
of the excess free energy, with the squared ReLU activation function
outperforming other activation choices. Among the DeepONet variants, the
Residual Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (RMSCNN) combined with a
trainable Gaussian derivative kernel (GK-RMSCNN-DeepONet) demonstrates the best
performance. Additionally, we applied the trained models to solve for the
density profiles at various external potentials and compared the results with

Abstract: Time-series data is a vital modality within data science communities. This is
particularly valuable in financial applications, where it helps in detecting
patterns, understanding market behavior, and making informed decisions based on
historical data. Recent advances in language modeling have led to the rise of
time-series pre-trained models that are trained on vast collections of datasets
and applied to diverse tasks across financial domains. However, across
financial applications, existing time-series pre-trained models have not shown
boosts in performance over simple finance benchmarks in both zero-shot and
fine-tuning settings. This phenomenon occurs because of a i) lack of financial
data within the pre-training stage, and ii) the negative transfer effect due to
inherently different time-series patterns across domains. Furthermore,
time-series data is continuous, noisy, and can be collected at varying
frequencies and with varying lags across different variables, making this data
more challenging to model than languages. To address the above problems, we
introduce a Pre-trained MoDEL for FINance TimE-series (Delphyne). Delphyne
achieves competitive performance to existing foundation and full-shot models
with few fine-tuning steps on publicly available datasets, and also shows
superior performances on various financial tasks.

Capitalization Adjusted Hype Index, adjusts for economic size by taking the
ratio of a stock's or sector's media weight to its market capitalization weight
within its industry or sector. We compute both versions of the Hype Index at
the stock and sector levels, and evaluate them through multiple lenses: (1)
their classification into different hype groups, (2) their associations with
returns, volatility, and VIX index at various lags, (3) their signaling power

Abstract: Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is beginning to
transform the financial industry by automating tasks and helping to make sense
of complex financial information. One especially promising use case is the
automatic creation of fundamental analysis reports, which are essential for
making informed investment decisions, evaluating credit risks, guiding
corporate mergers, etc. While LLMs attempt to generate these reports from a
single prompt, the risks of inaccuracy are significant. Poor analysis can lead
to misguided investments, regulatory issues, and loss of trust. Existing
financial benchmarks mainly evaluate how well LLMs answer financial questions
but do not reflect performance in real-world tasks like generating financial
analysis reports. In this paper, we propose FinAR-Bench, a solid benchmark
dataset focusing on financial statement analysis, a core competence of
fundamental analysis. To make the evaluation more precise and reliable, we
break this task into three measurable steps: extracting key information,

structured approach allows us to objectively assess how well LLMs perform each
step of the process. Our findings offer a clear understanding of LLMs current
strengths and limitations in fundamental analysis and provide a more practical
way to benchmark their performance in real-world financial settings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense promise for revolutionizing
financial analysis and decision-making, yet their direct application is often
hampered by issues of data hallucination and lack of access to real-time,
verifiable financial information. This paper introduces QuantMCP, a novel
framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By
leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized and secure tool
invocation, QuantMCP enables LLMs to accurately interface with a diverse array
of Python-accessible financial data APIs (e.g., Wind, yfinance). Users can
interact via natural language to precisely retrieve up-to-date financial data,
thereby overcoming LLM's inherent limitations in factual data recall. More
critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's
analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated
data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed
financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible,
and secure bridge between conversational AI and the complex world of financial
data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM
applications in finance.

*Hritika Gupta,Michel Mandjes,Liron Ravner,Jiesen Wang*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: This paper focuses on statistical inference in an infinite-server queue network, aiming to estimate parameters like the routing matrix, arrival rates, and service time parameters using observations of the network population vector at Poisson time points. It proposes a method-of-moments estimator, shows its consistency, and demonstrates accuracy in numerical experiments, considering both parametric and model-free service-time distribution assumptions.

Motivation: The motivation is to estimate the parameters of an infinite-server queue network, such as routing matrix, arrival rates, and service time parameters, using observations of the network population vector at Poisson time points.

Method: The paper proposes a method-of-moments estimator based on deriving the covariance structure of different nodes at various sampling epochs.

Result: The method-of-moments estimator is consistent and provides accurate estimates even with a large number of parameters, as shown by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the method is effective for parameter estimation in infinite-server queue networks, applicable both with known parametric service-time distributions and in a model-free setting.

Abstract: This paper studies statistical inference in a network of infinite-server
queues, with the aim of estimating the underlying parameters (routing matrix,
arrival rates, parameters pertaining to the service times) using observations
of the network population vector at Poisson time points. We propose a
method-of-moments estimator and establish its consistency. The method relies on
deriving the covariance structure of different nodes at different sampling
epochs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method yields accurate
estimates, even in settings with a large number of parameters. Two model
variants are considered: one that assumes a known parametric form for the
service-time distributions, and a model-free version that does not require such
assumptions.

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper discusses using Poisson midpoint discretization for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions, showing it converges faster in 2-Wasserstein distance than Euler-Maruyama, with a cubic speedup, and has better complexity than existing methods for underdamped Langevin dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions by developing a more effective discretization method for Langevin dynamics, which can lead to faster convergence and better performance in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: The authors employ the Poisson midpoint discretization, a variant of the randomized midpoint method, for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. They analyze the convergence properties of this method in the 2-Wasserstein distance and compare it with existing methods like Euler-Maruyama.

Result: The Poisson midpoint discretization achieves a cubic speedup in dependence on the target accuracy (epsilon) over the Euler-Maruyama discretization in terms of 2-Wasserstein convergence. Additionally, for underdamped Langevin dynamics, the method shows lower complexity for W_2 convergence compared to the established L^2 strong error lower bounds.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Poisson midpoint discretization is a more efficient method for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions, offering significant improvements in convergence speed and complexity, particularly for underdamped dynamics, which could have implications for better performance in high-dimensional statistical sampling and machine learning tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over
$\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the
randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We
prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic
speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the
Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized
midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we
demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the
complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in
the literature.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is a widely used method for
approximating high-dimensional probability distributions by product measures.
This paper studies the stability properties of the mean-field approximation
when the target distribution varies within the class of strongly log-concave
measures. We establish dimension-free Lipschitz continuity of the MFVI
optimizer with respect to the target distribution, measured in the
2-Wasserstein distance, with Lipschitz constant inversely proportional to the
log-concavity parameter. Under additional regularity conditions, we further
show that the MFVI optimizer depends differentiably on the target potential and
characterize the derivative by a partial differential equation.
Methodologically, we follow a novel approach to MFVI via linearized optimal
transport: the non-convex MFVI problem is lifted to a convex optimization over
transport maps with a fixed base measure, enabling the use of calculus of
variations and functional analysis. We discuss several applications of our
results to robust Bayesian inference and empirical Bayes, including a
quantitative Bernstein--von Mises theorem for MFVI, as well as to distributed
stochastic control.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed embedding provides a fast and scalable alternative to traditional methods for finding high-influence nodes in networks.

Abstract: Computing classical centrality measures such as betweenness and closeness is

Abstract: Constructing real-world data-to-insight pipelines often involves data
extraction from data lakes, data integration across heterogeneous data sources,
and diverse operations from data cleaning to analysis. The design and
implementation of data science pipelines require domain knowledge, technical
expertise, and even project-specific insights. AI systems have shown remarkable
reasoning, coding, and understanding capabilities. However, it remains unclear
to what extent these capabilities translate into successful design and
execution of such complex pipelines. We introduce KRAMABENCH: a benchmark
composed of 104 manually-curated real-world data science pipelines spanning
1700 data files from 24 data sources in 6 different domains. We show that these
pipelines test the end-to-end capabilities of AI systems on data processing,
requiring data discovery, wrangling and cleaning, efficient processing,
statistical reasoning, and orchestrating data processing steps given a
high-level task. Our evaluation tests 5 general models and 3 code generation
models using our reference framework, DS-GURU, which instructs the AI model to
decompose a question into a sequence of subtasks, reason through each step, and
synthesize Python code that implements the proposed design. Our results on
KRAMABENCH show that, although the models are sufficiently capable of solving
well-specified data science code generation tasks, when extensive data
processing and domain knowledge are required to construct real-world data
science pipelines, existing out-of-box models fall short. Progress on
KramaBench represents crucial steps towards developing autonomous data science
agents for real-world applications. Our code, reference framework, and data are

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages. In
contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly
for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains
significantly underexplored. HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and
demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability
constraints. Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks
beyond structural code generation, including testbench development,
assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration
for on-chip communication. The objective of our paper is to analyze the
capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog
implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of
embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. This paper introduces the
first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and
AXI. We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design
abstraction and prompt specificity. The generated designs are assessed for
syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform

Motivation: FPGA deployment of RL is resource-expensive due to high computational demands from training with high-quality images.

Conclusion: QForce-RL is scalable for resource-constrained devices and offers flexible efficiency in deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has outperformed other counterparts in sequential
decision-making and dynamic environment control. However, FPGA deployment is
significantly resource-expensive, as associated with large number of
computations in training agents with high-quality images and possess new
challenges. In this work, we propose QForce-RL takes benefits of quantization
to enhance throughput and reduce energy footprint with light-weight RL
architecture, without significant performance degradation. QForce-RL takes
advantages from E2HRL to reduce overall RL actions to learn desired policy and
QuaRL for quantization based SIMD for hardware acceleration. We have also
provided detailed analysis for different RL environments, with emphasis on
model size, parameters, and accelerated compute ops. The architecture is
scalable for resource-constrained devices and provide parametrized efficient
deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy
efficiency. The proposed QForce-RL provides performance enhancement up to 2.3x

Abstract: Design rule checking (DRC) is of great significance for cost reduction and
design efficiency improvement in integrated circuit (IC) designs.
Machine-learning-based DRC has become an important approach in computer-aided
design (CAD). In this paper, we propose MAGNet, a hybrid deep learning model
that integrates an improved U-Net with a graph neural network for DRC violation
prediction. The U-Net backbone is enhanced with a Dynamic Attention Module
(DAM) and a Multi-Scale Convolution Module (MSCM) to strengthen its capability
in extracting fine-grained and multi-scale spatial features. In parallel, we
construct a pixel-aligned graph structure based on chip layout tiles, and apply
a specialized GNN to model the topological relationships among pins. During
graph construction, a graph-to-grid mapping is generated to align GNN features
with the layout image. In addition, a label amplification strategy is adopted
during training to enhance the model's sensitivity to sparse violation
patterns. Overall, MAGNet effectively combines spatial, semantic, and
structural information, achieving improved prediction accuracy and reduced
false positive rates in DRC hotspot detection. Subsequently, through
incremental training, we achieve a more sensitive discrimination ability for
hotspots. The results demonstrate that, in comparison with ibUnet, RouteNet,
and J-Net, MAGnet significantly outperforms these models, achieving substantial
improvements in overall performance.

Abstract: Modern chip design is complex, and there is a crucial need for early-stage
prediction of key design-quality metrics like timing and routing congestion
directly from Verilog code (a commonly used programming language for hardware
design). It is especially important yet complex to predict individual lines of
code that cause timing violations or downstream routing congestion. Prior works
have tried approaches like converting Verilog into an intermediate graph
representation and using LLM embeddings alongside other features to predict
module-level quality, but did not consider line-level quality prediction. We
propose VeriLoC, the first method that predicts design quality directly from
Verilog at both the line- and module-level. To this end, VeriLoC leverages
recent Verilog code-generation LLMs to extract local line-level and
module-level embeddings, and train downstream classifiers/regressors on
concatenations of these embeddings. VeriLoC achieves high F1-scores of
0.86-0.95 for line-level congestion and timing prediction, and reduces the mean
average percentage error from 14% - 18% for SOTA methods down to only 4%. We
believe that VeriLoC embeddings and insights from our work will also be of
value for other predictive and optimization tasks for complex hardware design.

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a new lifetime-aware tensor
offloading framework for GPU memory expansion using low-cost PCIe-based
solid-state drives (SSDs). Our framework, TERAIO, is developed explicitly for
large language model (LLM) training with multiple GPUs and multiple SSDs. Its
design is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small
fraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training
iteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a
long period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching
tensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO
accurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each
tensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process.
With the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor
offloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via
PyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the
offloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor
migration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and
maximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art
studies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves
the training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves
80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.

captures the mathematical structure of preference relations over lotteries,
verifying that preferences satisfying the vNM axioms can be represented by

Abstract: This article proposes a robust brain-inspired audio feature extractor
(RBA-FE) model for depression diagnosis, using an improved hierarchical network
architecture. Most deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance
for image-based diagnostic tasks, ignoring the counterpart audio features. In
order to tailor the noise challenge, RBA-FE leverages six acoustic features
extracted from the raw audio, capturing both spatial characteristics and
temporal dependencies. This hybrid attribute helps alleviate the precision
limitation in audio feature extraction within other learning models like deep
residual shrinkage networks. To deal with the noise issues, our model
incorporates an improved spiking neuron model, called adaptive rate smooth
leaky integrate-and-fire (ARSLIF). The ARSLIF model emulates the mechanism of
``retuning of cellular signal selectivity" in the brain attention systems,
which enhances the model robustness against environmental noises in audio data.
Experimental results demonstrate that RBA-FE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
on the MODMA dataset, respectively with 0.8750, 0.8974, 0.8750 and 0.8750 in
precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014
and DAIC-WOZ datasets both show enhancements in noise robustness. It is further
indicated by comparison that the ARSLIF neuron model suggest the abnormal
firing pattern within the feature extraction on depressive audio data, offering
brain-inspired interpretability.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has achieved remarkable success with deep
learning, driving advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, media
transcription, and assistive technologies. However, ASR systems still struggle
in complex environments such as TV series, where overlapping speech,
domain-specific terminology, and long-range contextual dependencies pose
significant challenges to transcription accuracy. Existing multimodal
approaches fail to correct ASR outputs with the rich temporal and contextual
information available in video. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
multimodal post-correction framework that refines ASR transcriptions by
leveraging contextual cues extracted from video. Our framework consists of two
stages: ASR Generation and Video-based Post-Correction, where the first stage
produces the initial transcript and the second stage corrects errors using
Video-based Contextual Information Extraction and Context-aware ASR Correction.
We employ the Video-Large Multimodal Model (VLMM) to extract key contextual
information using tailored prompts, which is then integrated with a Large
Language Model (LLM) to refine the ASR output. We evaluate our method on a
multimodal benchmark for TV series ASR and demonstrate its effectiveness in
improving ASR performance by leveraging video-based context to enhance
transcription accuracy in complex multimedia environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deepfakes are AI-synthesized multimedia data that may be abused for spreading
misinformation. Deepfake generation involves both visual and audio
manipulation. To detect audio-visual deepfakes, previous studies commonly
employ two relatively independent sub-models to learn audio and visual
features, respectively, and fuse them subsequently for deepfake detection.
However, this may underutilize the inherent correlations between audio and
visual features. Moreover, utilizing two isolated feature learning sub-models
can result in redundant neural layers, making the overall model inefficient and
impractical for resource-constrained environments.
  In this work, we design a lightweight network for audio-visual deepfake
detection via a single-stream multi-modal learning framework. Specifically, we
introduce a collaborative audio-visual learning block to efficiently integrate
multi-modal information while learning the visual and audio features. By
iteratively employing this block, our single-stream network achieves a
continuous fusion of multi-modal features across its layers. Thus, our network
efficiently captures visual and audio features without the need for excessive
block stacking, resulting in a lightweight network design. Furthermore, we
propose a multi-modal classification module that can boost the dependence of
the visual and audio classifiers on modality content. It also enhances the
whole resistance of the video classifier against the mismatches between audio
and visual modalities. We conduct experiments on the DF-TIMIT, FakeAVCeleb, and
DFDC benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art audio-visual joint
detection methods, our method is significantly lightweight with only 0.48M
parameters, yet it achieves superiority in both uni-modal and multi-modal
deepfakes, as well as in unseen types of deepfakes.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models
have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song
generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex
composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to
limitations in sound quality, musicality, instruction following, and
vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an
LM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of
parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the
combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony,
and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for
high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a
modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different
token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we
introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a
semi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training. Experimental
results demonstrate that LeVo consistently outperforms existing methods on both
objective and subjective metrics. Ablation studies further justify the
effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples are available at

may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic
behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this
as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and
warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed
and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred
to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with
items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in
the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate
halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a
two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship
Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which
individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and
cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs
as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor
structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant
validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the
distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and
structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view
that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still
reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.

TL;DR: This paper explores the dual role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in combating and enabling disinformation through a communication game simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing challenge of disinformation online, where LLMs can both create and detect false information, necessitating a balanced approach to their application.

Method: The method involves a communication game inspired by Werewolf with 25 participants, examining how different roles (Disinformers, Moderators, Users) use LLMs to achieve their objectives.

Result: The results show that LLMs are used differently based on participants' roles and strategies, indicating both potential for misuse and effective mitigation of disinformation.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the need for future LLM development and platform design to balance user empowerment, trust-building, and risk reduction from LLM-assisted disinformation.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a dual challenge in
the fight against disinformation. These powerful tools, capable of generating
human-like text at scale, can be weaponised to produce sophisticated and
persuasive disinformation, yet they also hold promise for enhancing detection
and mitigation strategies. This paper investigates the complex dynamics between
LLMs and disinformation through a communication game that simulates online
forums, inspired by the game Werewolf, with 25 participants. We analyse how
Disinformers, Moderators, and Users leverage LLMs to advance their goals,
revealing both the potential for misuse and combating disinformation. Our
findings highlight the varying uses of LLMs depending on the participants'
roles and strategies, underscoring the importance of understanding their
effectiveness in this context. We conclude by discussing implications for
future LLM development and online platform design, advocating for a balanced
approach that empowers users and fosters trust while mitigating the risks of
LLM-assisted disinformation.

TL;DR: This paper discusses participatory AI and extends its principles to secondary stakeholders, identifying three archetypes and their challenges in achieving meaningful participation through informedness, consent, and agency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in participatory AI by including secondary stakeholders, not just end-users, to ensure more inclusive and ethical AI development.

Method: The method involves semi-structured interviews to explore how secondary stakeholders engage with AI systems and realize the three participatory ideals of informedness, consent, and agency.

Result: The result identifies three stakeholder archetypes: the reluctant data contributor, the unsupported activist, and the well-intentioned practitioner, each facing systemic barriers in achieving agentic AI relationships.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of enabling secondary stakeholders to participate meaningfully in AI systems, advocating for an inclusive AI future where they can influence and be influenced by AI technologies effectively.

Abstract: As AI technologies become more human-facing, there have been numerous calls
to adapt participatory approaches to AI development -- spurring the idea of
participatory AI. However, these calls often focus only on primary
stakeholders, such as end-users, and not secondary stakeholders. This paper
seeks to translate the ideals of participatory AI to a broader population of
secondary AI stakeholders through semi-structured interviews. We theorize that
meaningful participation involves three participatory ideals: (1) informedness,
(2) consent, and (3) agency. We also explore how secondary stakeholders realize
these ideals by traversing a complicated problem space. Like walking up the
rungs of a ladder, these ideals build on one another. We introduce three
stakeholder archetypes: the reluctant data contributor, the unsupported
activist, and the well-intentioned practitioner, who must navigate systemic
barriers to achieving agentic AI relationships. We envision an AI future where
secondary stakeholders are able to meaningfully participate with the AI systems
they influence and are influenced by.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have
demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of
single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by
underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to
discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic,
completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and
(2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the
expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce
G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by
organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a
three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon
receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal
to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the
system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed
interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration
experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating
new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent
teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and
three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates
in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and
$10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental
to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on
this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition
formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo,
using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in
this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent
coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains
an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates
agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to
generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document
writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our
approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models
to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design
algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To
evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that
AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where
traditional tools are limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of using general LLMs in medical imaging, such as hallucinations and limited domain knowledge, which can affect clinical accuracy.

Method: Proposed MedChat, a multi-agent system with specialized vision models and multiple role-specific LLM agents, managed by a director agent for coordinated diagnostic reporting.

Result: Enhanced reliability, reduced hallucination risk, and interactive diagnostic reporting interface suitable for clinical and educational purposes.

Conclusion: MedChat provides an automated solution for glaucoma detection and clinical reporting, leveraging multi-agent systems to overcome limitations of single generalist LLMs.

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language
models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist
shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general
LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited
interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can
potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining
imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely
on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse
and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address
these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and
platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific
LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances
reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic
reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational
use. Code available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/MedChat.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong
reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent
planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities
and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based
planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to
multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a
framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during
test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better
planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by
centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement
learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)}
paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents
learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend
the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support
informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and
iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on
new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining
individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and
flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative
Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport benchmarks demonstrate
that LIET, instantiated with both LLaMA and GPT-4o, outperforms existing
baselines and exhibits strong cooperative planning abilities.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong collaborative performance in
multi-agent systems with predefined roles and workflows. However, in open-ended
environments lacking coordination rules, agents tend to act in self-interested
ways. The central challenge in achieving coordination lies in credit assignment
-- fairly evaluating each agent's contribution and designing pricing mechanisms
that align their heterogeneous goals. This problem is critical as LLMs
increasingly participate in complex human-AI collaborations, where fair
compensation and accountability rely on effective pricing mechanisms. Inspired
by how human societies address similar coordination challenges (e.g., through
temporary collaborations such as employment or subcontracting), we propose a
cooperative workflow, Shapley-Coop. Shapley-Coop integrates Shapley
Chain-of-Thought -- leveraging marginal contributions as a principled basis for
pricing -- with structured negotiation protocols for effective price matching,
enabling LLM agents to coordinate through rational task-time pricing and
post-task reward redistribution. This approach aligns agent incentives, fosters
cooperation, and maintains autonomy. We evaluate Shapley-Coop across two
multi-agent games and a software engineering simulation, demonstrating that it
consistently enhances LLM agent collaboration and facilitates equitable credit
assignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of Shapley-Coop's pricing
mechanisms in accurately reflecting individual contributions during task
execution.

*Pavel Naumov,Jia Tao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper discusses how diffusion of responsibility occurs in group decisions and concludes that to avoid it, a single agent must decide, either as a dictator or through election.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of diffusion of responsibility in collective decision-making, which can lead to undesirable outcomes by making individual accountability unclear.

Method: The authors use a bisimulation approach to model decision-making mechanisms, demonstrating that bisimulation preserves responsibility properties and analyzing the simplest such mechanism.

Result: If two agents make a decision, a dictator is needed to avoid diffusion of responsibility. For more than two agents, a diffusion-free mechanism requires an elected dictator.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that any mechanism avoiding diffusion of responsibility in group decisions must involve a single agent making decisions unilaterally, either through direct dictatorship or via election.

Abstract: The term "diffusion of responsibility'' refers to situations in which
multiple agents share responsibility for an outcome, obscuring individual
accountability. This paper examines this frequently undesirable phenomenon in
the context of collective decision-making mechanisms.
  The work shows that if a decision is made by two agents, then the only way to
avoid diffusion of responsibility is for one agent to act as a "dictator'',
making the decision unilaterally. In scenarios with more than two agents, any
diffusion-free mechanism is an "elected dictatorship'' where the agents elect a
single agent to make a unilateral decision.
  The technical results are obtained by defining a bisimulation of
decision-making mechanisms, proving that bisimulation preserves
responsibility-related properties, and establishing the results for a smallest
bisimular mechanism.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Long document understanding has become increasingly crucial in natural
language processing, with retrieval-based methods emerging as a promising
solution to address the context length limitations of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing approaches either treat documents as flat sequences
or employ arbitrary chunking strategies, failing to capture the inherent
discourse structure that guides human comprehension. We present DISRetrieval, a
novel hierarchical retrieval framework that leverages linguistic discourse
structure to enhance long document understanding. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a discourse-aware document organization framework that
utilizes rhetorical structure theory (RST) to create sentence-level
hierarchical representations, preserving both semantic relationships and
natural document flow; (2) an LLM-enhanced node representation technique that
combines discourse structure with adaptive summarization to enrich tree nodes
with contextual information; and (3) a hierarchical evidence retrieval
mechanism that effectively selects relevant content while maintaining discourse
coherence. Through comprehensive experiments on QASPER and QuALITY datasets,
DISRetrieval demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in
both token-level retrieval metrics and downstream question answering tasks. Our
ablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly
enhances retrieval effectiveness across different document lengths and query
types, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document
representation in long-text understanding. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at github/DreamH1gh/DISRetrieval to facilitate future research.

Abstract: For personalized marketing, a new challenge of how to effectively algorithm
the A/B testing to maximize user response is urgently to be overcome. In this
paper, we present a new approach, the RL-LLM-AB test framework, for using
reinforcement learning strategy optimization combined with LLM to automate and
personalize A/B tests. The RL-LLM-AB test is built upon the pre-trained
instruction-tuned language model. It first generates A/B versions of candidate
content variants using a Prompt-Conditioned Generator, and then dynamically
embeds and fuses the user portrait and the context of the current query with
the multi-modal perception module to constitute the current interaction state.
The content version is then selected in real-time through the policy
optimization module with an Actor-Critic structure, and long-term revenue is
estimated according to real-time feedback (such as click-through rate and
conversion rate). Furthermore, a Memory-Augmented Reward Estimator is embedded
into the framework to capture long-term user preference drift, which helps to
generalize policy across multiple users and content contexts. Numerical results
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RL-LLM-ABTest over existing A/B
testing methods, including classical A/B testing, Contextual Bandits, and
benchmark reinforcement learning approaches on real-world marketing data.

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only
tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such
as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has
revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT
on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources,
such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on
generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods
to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing
suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are
additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic
modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained
on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the
largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter
size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the
financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1)
Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT
variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five
financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models
(Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over
BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3)
Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables
superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work
revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary
LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the
LLMs era.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture
for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large

high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains
underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of
state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding
models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets.
Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four
core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and
answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking
outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and
Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The
inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness
in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These
findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG
pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components
across different document types.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of online education platforms, an increasing

student learning outcomes. However, existing methods not only struggle with
high dropout rates but also fail to match the diverse learning pace of
students. They frequently face difficulties in adjusting to inactive students'
learning patterns and in accommodating individualized learning paces, resulting
in limited accuracy and diversity in recommendations. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Neural Re-ranking for Diversified Exercise
Recommendation (in short, NR4DER). NR4DER first leverages the mLSTM model to
improve the effectiveness of the exercise filter module. It then employs a
sequence enhancement method to enhance the representation of inactive students,
accurately matches students with exercises of appropriate difficulty. Finally,
it utilizes neural re-ranking to generate diverse recommendation lists based on
individual students' learning histories. Extensive experimental results
indicate that NR4DER significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple
real-world datasets and effectively caters to the diverse learning pace of
students.

However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based
retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in

personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned
Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a
unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty

HotelMatch-LLM compared to 0.603 for the most effective baseline, MARVEL. Our
analysis highlights the impact of our multi-task optimization, the
generalizability of HotelMatch-LLM across LLM architectures, and its
scalability for processing large image galleries.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems must adapt to user interactions across
different domains. Traditional approaches like MLoRA apply a single adaptation
per domain but lack flexibility in handling diverse user behaviors. To address
this, we propose MoE-MLoRA, a mixture-of-experts framework where each expert is
first trained independently to specialize in its domain before a gating network
is trained to weight their contributions dynamically. We evaluate MoE-MLoRA
across eight CTR models on Movielens and Taobao, showing that it improves
performance in large-scale, dynamic datasets (+1.45 Weighed-AUC in Taobao-20)
but offers limited benefits in structured datasets with low domain diversity
and sparsity. Further analysis of the number of experts per domain reveals that
larger ensembles do not always improve performance, indicating the need for
model-aware tuning. Our findings highlight the potential of expert-based
architectures for multi-domain recommendation systems, demonstrating that
task-aware specialization and adaptive gating can enhance predictive accuracy
in complex environments. The implementation and code are available in our
GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous
robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or
substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because
tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that
require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A
human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception
techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more
informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in
order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and
different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention
recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an
open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active
tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume
estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from
simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using
vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive
dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600
real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this
dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By
providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our
benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile
sensing and active perception.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to
operate in critical applications. However, traditional verification and
validation methods often struggle to handle the unpredictable and dynamic
nature of AI components. In this paper, we introduce CPS-Guard, a novel
framework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative

evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability
requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an
autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our
results show that CPS-Guard effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages
performance impacts, and supports adaptive recovery strategies, thereby
offering a structured and extensible solution for rigorous V&V in safety- and

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board
perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,
while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them
unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative
framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that
leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,
multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key
algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and
Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data
from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where
individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting
mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data
from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in
real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We
develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped
robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our
experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of
improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional
single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,
edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of
edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive
autonomous systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) policies trained on offline datasets often
exhibit degraded task performance when deployed in unfamiliar navigation
environments at test time, where agents are typically evaluated without access
to external interaction or feedback. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
practical solution for reducing prediction uncertainty at test time; however,
it can suffer from accumulated errors, as agents may become overconfident in
incorrect actions without sufficient contextual grounding. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce ATENA (Active TEst-time Navigation Agent), a test-time
active learning framework that enables a practical human-robot interaction via
episodic feedback on uncertain navigation outcomes. In particular, ATENA learns
to increase certainty in successful episodes and decrease it in failed ones,
improving uncertainty calibration. Here, we propose mixture entropy
optimization, where entropy is obtained from a combination of the action and
pseudo-expert distributions-a hypothetical action distribution assuming the
agent's selected action to be optimal-controlling both prediction confidence
and action preference. In addition, we propose a self-active learning strategy
that enables an agent to evaluate its navigation outcomes based on confident
predictions. As a result, the agent stays actively engaged throughout all
iterations, leading to well-grounded and adaptive decision-making. Extensive
evaluations on challenging VLN benchmarks-REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE-demonstrate
that ATENA successfully overcomes distributional shifts at test time,
outperforming the compared baseline methods across various settings.

Abstract: Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized
as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks.
However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved
generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from
additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video
datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can
continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this
work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an
in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories,
collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and
steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply
SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks
on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge
over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original
in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is
surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is
filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through
adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online
experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a
high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through
self-improvement.

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely.
Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually
does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory.
Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple
trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face
optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands
of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences,
especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to
overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a
coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based
augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and
a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS
in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical
capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while
maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

Abstract: Dual-arm robots play a crucial role in improving efficiency and flexibility
in complex multitasking scenarios. While existing methods have achieved
promising results in task planning, they often fail to fully optimize task
parallelism, limiting the potential of dual-arm collaboration. To address this
issue, we propose RoboPARA, a novel large language model (LLM)-driven framework
for dual-arm task parallelism planning. RoboPARA employs a two-stage process:
(1) Dependency Graph-based Planning Candidates Generation, which constructs
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies and eliminate
redundancy, and (2) Graph Re-Traversal-based Dual-Arm Parallel Planning, which
optimizes DAG traversal to maximize parallelism while maintaining task
coherence. In addition, we introduce the Cross-Scenario Dual-Arm Parallel Task
dataset (X-DAPT dataset), the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate
dual-arm task parallelism across diverse scenarios and difficulty levels.
Extensive experiments on the X-DAPT dataset demonstrate that RoboPARA
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher efficiency and
reliability, particularly in complex task combinations. The code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subterranean environments like culverts have poor lighting and few features, making robot vision difficult. Onboard lights cause problems like reflections and high power use.

Method: NightHawk uses Bayesian optimization to find optimal light intensity and exposure time. It has a new feature detector metric as a cost function and is an event-triggered recursive pipeline.

Result: Field tests showed 47-197% better feature detection and matching, leading to more reliable visual estimates in tough lighting.

Conclusion: NightHawk effectively enhances robot vision in low-light subterranean areas by balancing illumination and exposure, reducing issues from traditional lighting methods.

Abstract: Subterranean environments such as culverts present significant challenges to
robot vision due to dim lighting and lack of distinctive features. Although
onboard illumination can help, it introduces issues such as specular
reflections, overexposure, and increased power consumption. We propose
NightHawk, a framework that combines active illumination with exposure control
to optimize image quality in these settings. NightHawk formulates an online
Bayesian optimization problem to determine the best light intensity and
exposure-time for a given scene. We propose a novel feature detector-based
metric to quantify image utility and use it as the cost function for the
optimizer. We built NightHawk as an event-triggered recursive optimization
pipeline and deployed it on a legged robot navigating a culvert beneath the
Erie Canal. Results from field experiments demonstrate improvements in feature
detection and matching by 47-197% enabling more reliable visual estimation in
challenging lighting conditions.

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage
pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event
descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment
mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional
modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal
spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained
multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these
maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our
maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to
audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When
combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural
language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the
sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across
different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.
Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a
unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues
through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.
This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or
audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the
incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal
disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps
enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by
50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and
tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual,
audio, and spatial cues.

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning is a promising paradigm in autonomous
driving, enabling decision-making with diverse trajectory candidates. A key
component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal
trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on
scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically
generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization.
Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to
make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision
but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified
framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and
fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary
innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse
fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a
scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its
robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy
that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement
training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the
Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with
sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on
ground-truth perception. Code will be available at

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled

strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2
capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under
explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for
evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation.
RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task
horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a
hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level
vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol
targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2
interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT
generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human
operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality
trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks,
RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser
annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and
analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the
development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.

Abstract: Learning to control high-speed objects in the real world remains a
challenging frontier in robotics. Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for
this problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and
precise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental
challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately
predicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic
planning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature
of table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it
particularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in
fast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present
SpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation
learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two
key attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a
spike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in
ball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties
such as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module
that enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system
harnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking,
combined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory
correction and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target
area and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous
state-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant
performance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated
tactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn new robotic tasks from scratch is
often inefficient. Leveraging prior knowledge has the potential to
significantly enhance learning efficiency, which, however, raises two critical
challenges: how to determine the relevancy of existing knowledge and how to
adaptively integrate them into learning a new task. In this paper, we propose
Context-aware Adaptation for Robot Learning (CARoL), a novel framework to
efficiently learn a similar but distinct new task from prior knowledge. CARoL
incorporates context awareness by analyzing state transitions in system
dynamics to identify similarities between the new task and prior knowledge. It
then utilizes these identified similarities to prioritize and adapt specific
knowledge pieces for the new task. Additionally, CARoL has a broad
applicability spanning policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic RL
algorithms. We validate the efficiency and generalizability of CARoL on both
simulated robotic platforms and physical ground vehicles. The simulations
include CarRacing and LunarLander environments, where CARoL demonstrates faster
convergence and higher rewards when learning policies for new tasks. In
real-world experiments, we show that CARoL enables a ground vehicle to quickly
and efficiently adapt policies learned in simulation to smoothly traverse
real-world off-road terrain.

Abstract: The problem of relocating a set of objects to designated areas amidst movable
obstacles can be framed as a Geometric Task and Motion Planning (G-TAMP)
problem, a subclass of task and motion planning (TAMP). Traditional approaches
to G-TAMP have relied either on domain-independent heuristics or on learning
from planning experience to guide the search, both of which typically demand
significant computational resources or data. In contrast, humans often use
common sense to intuitively decide which objects to manipulate in G-TAMP
problems. Inspired by this, we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs),
which have common sense knowledge acquired from internet-scale data, to guide
task planning in G-TAMP problems. To enable LLMs to perform geometric
reasoning, we design a predicate-based prompt that encodes geometric
information derived from a motion planning algorithm. We then query the LLM to
generate a task plan, which is then used to search for a feasible set of
continuous parameters. Since LLMs are prone to mistakes, instead of committing
to LLM's outputs, we extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to a hybrid action
space and use the LLM to guide the search. Unlike the previous approach that
calls an LLM at every node and incurs high computational costs, we use it to
warm-start the MCTS with the nodes explored in completing the LLM's task plan.
On six different G-TAMP problems, we show our method outperforms previous LLM
planners and pure search algorithms. Code can be found at:

Abstract: Spatial awareness is a critical capability for embodied agents, as it enables
them to anticipate and reason about unobserved regions. The primary challenge
arises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by
sparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing
methods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not
generalize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \textbf{MapBERT},
a novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen
spaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps
aligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first
time, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact
bitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer
missing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations.
To enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking
strategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with
learnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object
embeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more
effectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical
robotic tasks. Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show that MapBERT achieves
state-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing computational efficiency
with accurate reconstruction of unobserved regions.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive capabilities across
a wide range of robotics manipulation tasks. However, their growing model size
poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic
systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the
inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss,
its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present
BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every
parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint
of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that
compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process,
a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent
representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA
achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with
4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only
29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on
memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in

Abstract: Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential
for deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic
deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial
capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this
limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method
named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective
adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with
a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and
interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These
human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action
preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure
action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically,
we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of
irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing
preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from
binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these
modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures
reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The

Abstract: Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world,
increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of
state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action
models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled
temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address
the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements
at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that
enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method,
real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out
of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while
executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and
"inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly
dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging
real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast,
performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving
task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks
$\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the
presence of significant latency. See

TL;DR: The paper presents a multi-robot system using 3D scene graphs for mapping, localization, and task planning to handle complex natural language instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to understand and execute complex tasks in large, outdoor environments by integrating mapping, localization, and planning with natural language processing.

Method: The system uses a shared 3D scene graph with an open-set object-based map for multi-robot fusion, and an LLM to translate instructions into PDDL goals.

Result: The system demonstrates effective real-time relocalization and planning in large-scale outdoor tasks, showing improved coordination among robots.

Conclusion: Integrating 3D scene graphs and LLMs enhances multi-robot systems' ability to handle complex tasks through better environmental understanding and task execution.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi-robot system that integrates mapping,
localization, and task and motion planning (TAMP) enabled by 3D scene graphs to
execute complex instructions expressed in natural language. Our system builds a
shared 3D scene graph incorporating an open-set object-based map, which is
leveraged for multi-robot 3D scene graph fusion. This representation supports
real-time, view-invariant relocalization (via the object-based map) and
planning (via the 3D scene graph), allowing a team of robots to reason about
their surroundings and execute complex tasks. Additionally, we introduce a
planning approach that translates operator intent into Planning Domain
Definition Language (PDDL) goals using a Large Language Model (LLM) by
leveraging context from the shared 3D scene graph and robot capabilities. We
provide an experimental assessment of the performance of our system on
real-world tasks in large-scale, outdoor environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building
vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to
effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D
signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the
spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In
this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D
inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,
and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and
output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a
scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability
to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments
show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and
effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across
three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate
from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better
performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average
success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing
baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments,
BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It
generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual
disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a
success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task,
highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency. Project

### [642] [On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382)
*Michał P. Karpowicz*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper presents an impossibility theorem showing that large language models cannot avoid hallucinations due to conflicting requirements in their inference mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explain why hallucinations are inherent in large language models and identify the trade-offs involved in their design.

Method: The authors model LLM inference as an auction of ideas using the Green-Laffont theorem to prove the impossibility of satisfying all four properties simultaneously.

Result: The paper demonstrates that no inference mechanism can satisfy truthful generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality at the same time.

Conclusion: The findings have implications for model architecture, training objectives, and evaluation methods, suggesting that trade-offs must be made in the design of large language models.

Abstract: This paper explains \textbf{why it is impossible to create large language
models that do not hallucinate and what are the trade-offs we should be looking
for}. It presents a formal \textbf{impossibility theorem} demonstrating that no
inference mechanism can simultaneously satisfy four fundamental properties:
\textbf{truthful (non-hallucinatory) generation, semantic information
conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained
optimality}. By modeling LLM inference as an \textbf{auction of ideas} where
neural components compete to contribute to responses, we prove the
impossibility using the Green-Laffont theorem. That mathematical framework
provides a rigorous foundation for understanding the nature of inference
process, with implications for model architecture, training objectives, and
evaluation methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a statistical framework for systematic model selection in LSTMs, improving upon heuristic methods with techniques like information criteria and variational Bayes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in model selection for LSTMs, which are currently heuristic and computationally intensive, especially in biomedical applications.

Method: The method involves extending classical model selection techniques to LSTMs, using penalized likelihoods, generalized threshold approaches for hidden states, and variational Bayes for efficient estimation.

Result: The results show that the framework enhances model performance and flexibility, particularly in biomedical data scenarios.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed statistical framework offers a more systematic and effective approach to model selection in LSTM networks compared to existing heuristic methods.

Abstract: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models have become the
cornerstone for sequential data modeling in numerous applications, ranging from
natural language processing to time series forecasting. Despite their success,
the problem of model selection, including hyperparameter tuning, architecture
specification, and regularization choice remains largely heuristic and
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a unified statistical
framework for systematic model selection in LSTM networks. Our framework
extends classical model selection ideas, such as information criteria and
shrinkage estimation, to sequential neural networks. We define penalized
likelihoods adapted to temporal structures, propose a generalized threshold
approach for hidden state dynamics, and provide efficient estimation strategies
using variational Bayes and approximate marginal likelihood methods. Several
biomedical data centric examples demonstrate the flexibility and improved
performance of the proposed framework.

Abstract: The graph coloring problem (GCP) is a classic combinatorial optimization
problem that aims to find the minimum number of colors assigned to vertices of
a graph such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. GCP has been
extensively studied by researchers from various fields, including mathematics,
computer science, and biological science. Due to the NP-hard nature, many
heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve GCP. However, existing GCP
algorithms focus on either small hard graphs or large-scale sparse graphs (with
up to 10^7 vertices). This paper presents an efficient hybrid heuristic
algorithm for GCP, named HyColor, which excels in handling large-scale sparse
graphs while achieving impressive results on small dense graphs. The efficiency
of HyColor comes from the following three aspects: a local decision strategy to
improve the lower bound on the chromatic number; a graph-reduction strategy to
reduce the working graph; and a k-core and mixed degree-based greedy heuristic
for efficiently coloring graphs. HyColor is evaluated against three
state-of-the-art GCP algorithms across four benchmarks, comprising three
large-scale sparse graph benchmarks and one small dense graph benchmark,
totaling 209 instances. The results demonstrate that HyColor consistently
outperforms existing heuristic algorithms in both solution accuracy and
computational efficiency for the majority of instances. Notably, HyColor
achieved the best solutions in 194 instances (over 93%), with 34 of these
solutions significantly surpassing those of other algorithms. Furthermore,
HyColor successfully determined the chromatic number and achieved optimal
coloring in 128 instances.
