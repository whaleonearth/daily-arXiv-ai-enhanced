Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in
structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions
involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However,
traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on
Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them
unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like
ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint
repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a
physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to
SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to
construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based
homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction
without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The
method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via
handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow
interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared
to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine
length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while
maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,
interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable
deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space
modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically
grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack
evolution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate pest population monitoring and tracking their dynamic changes are
crucial for precision agriculture decision-making. A common limitation in
existing vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are
typically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world
scenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack
of ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively
evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related
to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest
detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting
result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality
assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity
assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image
acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.
Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis
method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity
assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for
pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information
related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into
a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting
confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to
comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and
quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting
confidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by
31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,
compared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting
results.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic
origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network
models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional
traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite
imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both
parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To
extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at

Motivation: Existing studies on remote sensing classification focus on narrow tasks or datasets, limiting their generalizability. The paper aims to address this by creating a more versatile model.

Method: The authors developed SpatialNet-ViT by integrating Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL), incorporating techniques like data augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

Result: The model improves classification accuracy and scalability, showing enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse remote sensing datasets.

Conclusion: By combining spatial awareness with contextual understanding through ViTs and MTL, SpatialNet-ViT offers a promising solution for various remote sensing classification challenges.

Abstract: Remote sensing datasets offer significant promise for tackling key
classification tasks such as land-use categorization, object presence
detection, and rural/urban classification. However, many existing studies tend
to focus on narrow tasks or datasets, which limits their ability to generalize
across various remote sensing classification challenges. To overcome this, we
propose a novel model, SpatialNet-ViT, leveraging the power of Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). This integrated approach
combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both
classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, techniques like data
augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning are employed to
enhance model robustness and its ability to generalize across diverse datasets

*Michiel Schepers,Pieter Robberechts,Jan Van Haaren,Jesse Davis*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding of dribbling skills in soccer by capturing aspects like balance, orientation, and ball control that 2D data cannot.

Method: Extracted novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions League season and evaluated their impact on dribble success.

Result: Features related to attacker's balance and orientation alignment with defender are informative for predicting dribble success, improving model performance when added to 2D data.

Conclusion: Pose tracking data enhances dribble evaluation beyond traditional 2D methods, offering new insights into player skills.

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Abstract: This investigation attempts to create an automated framework for fault
detection and organization for usage in contemporary radiography, as per NDE
4.0. The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is
sufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,
and determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its
basic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing
223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as
virtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the
preparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data
to produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the
model, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call
rate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong
differentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves
exceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and
fake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly
wins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken
down efficiently and quickly. Professional controllers evaluate the transmitted
system in the field and believe that it has a guarantee as a support device in
the testing cycle, irrespective of particular equipment cut-off points and
programming resemblance.

Abstract: Containers are an integral part of the logistics industry and act as a
barrier for cargo. A typical service life for a container is more than 20
years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the
mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard
for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company.
Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key
for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper,
we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three
state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR.
We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the
model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of
this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage
detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%
compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for
not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others
overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers
as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image
synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic
consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail
(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic
alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene
composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an
N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and
placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,
(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate
shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over
background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework
include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting
consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while
mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of
240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered
synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object
relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks
and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space
fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining
competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable
improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of
prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural
aesthetics over existing works.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal
signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To
develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more
semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the
quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential
for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to animate still images by leveraging existing image data, enabling the creation of motion from static sources without direct replication.

Method: The method involves clustering image patches from datasets with k-means and reconstructing a target image by matching and random sampling from these clusters.

Result: The result is a technique that can generate animated sequences from still images by reusing local structures from different domains.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that this approach allows for conceptual differences between source and target images while maintaining local structural similarities, achieving effective image animation through reinterpretation.

Abstract: We present a patch-based image reconstruction and animation method that uses
existing image data to bring still images to life through motion. Image patches
from curated datasets are grouped using k-means clustering and a new target
image is reconstructed by matching and randomly sampling from these clusters.
This approach emphasizes reinterpretation over replication, allowing the source

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for
videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video
object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.
First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,
we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with
diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in
the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all
possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual
problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing
during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as
fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating
image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video
object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale
effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the
length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even
generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire
video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector
on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with
strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We
also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is
competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational
bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of
real-world data availability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is crucial for improving crop management, resource utilization, and productivity. However, existing methods often struggle with balancing model complexity and performance, especially in detecting farmland anomalies.

Method: The authors propose a Dual Atrous Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module integrated into a DeepLabV3 framework. They also implement strategic skip connections from an optimal encoder stage to the decoder to enhance fine-grained spatial feature capture.

Result: The proposed model outperforms its baseline and matches the performance of complex transformer-based SOTA models on the Agriculture Vision dataset while being more than 66% efficient in terms of computational complexity.

Conclusion: The study presents an efficient and effective solution for agricultural semantic segmentation, offering a lightweight model that maintains high-quality performance, which is beneficial for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern
agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop
management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This
study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision
agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support
informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous
Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the
DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously
designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size,
thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study
also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the
encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed
model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly
complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture
Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency
when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance,
compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective
solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications,
offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality
performance in agricultural imagery.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,
economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or
semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,
reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and
transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the
recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing
layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding
in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and
neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To
address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that
integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on
historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding
module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture
polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies
this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from
LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal
information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance
directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence
robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods
on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the
effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for fMRI data, like CNNs and transformers, fail to capture long-range spatial and temporal dependencies efficiently.

Method: BrainMT uses a two-stage approach: a bidirectional Mamba block with temporal-first scanning for global temporal interactions, and a transformer block with self-attention for spatial relationships in deep features.

Result: BrainMT shows state-of-the-art performance on UKBioBank and Human Connectome Project datasets for sex prediction and cognitive intelligence prediction tasks.

Conclusion: BrainMT effectively models spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data, outperforming existing methods and offering potential for broader neuroimaging applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic
measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However,
existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or
transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships
inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial
and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate
long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in
two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning
mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally
efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to
model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the
Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,
UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and
regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing
methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be

Abstract: We present Seg-R1, a preliminary exploration of using reinforcement learning
(RL) to enhance the pixel-level understanding and reasoning capabilities of
large multimodal models (LMMs). Starting with foreground segmentation tasks,
specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection
(SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts
in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing
segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into
the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension
through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves
remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure
on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL
training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained
solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,
Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and
reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on
ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and
reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A
common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,
generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or
at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an
over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model
suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual
input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.
Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,
we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any
VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module
is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used
VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on
multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with
many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve
improved results for each one.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown
promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large,
high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance
over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current
diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process
and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1)
Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the
evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches
between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these
issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided
Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the
distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a
probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines
the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood.
CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets,
surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges
on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and
adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although
IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex
degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability
for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect,
resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations.
In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose
a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we
employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a
well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique
during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different
degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer
the degradation-related knowledge acquired by the teacher to the student for
practical inferencing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IDR discriminability-driven BSR model design. The proposed LightBSR can achieve
outstanding performance with minimal complexity across a range of blind SR
tasks. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/MJ-NCEPU/LightBSR.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for
articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve
these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single
articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point
clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.
Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the
object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the
object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using
measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods
that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an
alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we
represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D
Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,
translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our
representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences
between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of
each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned
Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our
method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point
correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate
real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further
demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to
existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are
completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation
performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with
occlusions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 6D pose confidence region estimation has emerged as a critical direction,
aiming to perform uncertainty quantification for assessing the reliability of
estimated poses. However, current sampling-based approach suffers from critical
limitations that severely impede their practical deployment: 1) the sampling
speed significantly decreases as the number of samples increases. 2) the
derived confidence regions are often excessively large. To address these
challenges, we propose a deterministic and efficient method for estimating pose
confidence regions. Our approach uses inductive conformal prediction to
calibrate the deterministically regressed Gaussian keypoint distributions into
2D keypoint confidence regions. We then leverage the implicit function theorem
to propagate these keypoint confidence regions directly into 6D pose confidence
regions. This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes
associated with sampling and ensembling. It provides compact confidence regions
that cover the ground-truth poses with a user-defined confidence level.
Experimental results on the LineMOD Occlusion and SPEED datasets show that our
method achieves higher pose estimation accuracy with reduced computational
time. For the same coverage rate, our method yields significantly smaller
confidence region volumes, reducing them by up to 99.9\% for rotations and
99.8\% for translations. The code will be available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges in training deep learning models for human sensing on edge systems, such as limited sensor data and resource constraints, which lead to accuracy loss and poor adaptability.

Method: XTransfer uses model repairing to address modality shift with minimal sensor data and layer recombining to create compact models by searching and recombining layers from source models.

Result: XTransfer shows state-of-the-art performance on human sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection, model training, and edge deployment.

Conclusion: XTransfer is a novel, resource-efficient, and modality-agnostic approach that improves model transfer in edge systems for human sensing applications.

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

Abstract: Current multimodal medical image fusion typically assumes that source images
are of high quality and perfectly aligned at the pixel level. Its effectiveness
heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling
misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a
general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning
module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input
images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint
optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design
an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to
encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature
alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One
configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,
incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA
principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with
degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a
single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies
alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental
results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
significant advantages over existing approaches.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a
mainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To
generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep
learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that
learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial
attribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset
for colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121
large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute
complexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve
the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU
framework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a
geometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the
latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood
correlations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute
up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation
(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate
coarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement
module is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce
high-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and
geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10
decibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,
8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diffusion-based method for metalens photography that uses pretrained models and pseudo data augmentation to overcome optical degradation and computational restoration challenges without relying on large datasets or calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metalenses have potential for compact computational imaging but struggle with optical degradation and computational restoration. Current methods need precise calibration or big datasets, which are hard to get. Also, they can create fake artifacts because they don't control the process well.

Method: The framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths to balance details, structure, and degradation suppression. It includes a tunable decoder for adjusting fidelity vs. perceptual quality and an SVDA module for handling spatially varying degradation. They also built a MetaCamera for testing.

Result: The approach works better than current methods, giving clearer and more accurate images. The MetaCamera shows it's good in real life.

Conclusion: Using pretrained models and their natural image priors helps fix metalens issues without big datasets. The methods allow control over image quality and handle different kinds of degradation. The MetaCamera proves the idea works in real systems.

Abstract: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational
imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational
restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical
calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world
imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process
often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce
Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,
leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of
large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths
to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and
suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data
augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity
and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware
attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced
degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for
real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image

Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen
significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse
environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world
demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing
simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the
challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges,
we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic
manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the
construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration
videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various
object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic
Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by
incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation
production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command
interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for
performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we
conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including
RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which
demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks.
To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results.
However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers
struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long
sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence
modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we
propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution
framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces
Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract
long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently.
To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment
module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the
compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions.
Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and
ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency
Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances
visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art
results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake datasets do not effectively deceive human perception, highlighting the need for more realistic attack vectors.

Method: PhonemeFake manipulates critical speech segments using language reasoning. The detection model uses a bilevel approach to adaptively prioritize compute on manipulated regions.

Result: PF reduces human perception by 42% and benchmark accuracies by 94%. The detection model reduces EER by 91% and achieves 90% speed-up with minimal compute overhead.

Conclusion: PhonemeFake demonstrates the effectiveness of language reasoning in creating realistic deepfake attacks and provides a scalable solution for detection with improved efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become
increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets
fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public
discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We
introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech
segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by
up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF
dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that
adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive
experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model
reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute
overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable
solution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a
fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.
A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and
structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.
Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and
images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate
encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,
these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often
requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.
Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.
MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the
detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and
camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view
from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free
matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without
relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,
we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility
prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with
low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive
experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds),
despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS. (Camera-ready version

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with
deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their
decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning,
most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without
modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck
Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU).
CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable
framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual
understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined
(removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM
then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both
interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and
transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft,
and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum
increase in average accuracy across 1.03%. Source code is available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major
concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked
concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting
target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with
minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods
usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,
we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion
models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to
weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we
propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding
\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or
cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad
distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the
forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text
embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance
robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of
celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the
proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while
deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts. Code is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for
emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique
advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture
authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However,
cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual
variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a
frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses
these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces
frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant
frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic
graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and
implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines
hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to
capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves
cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of
integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical
modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences. The code is

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on
training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by
distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these
methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies,
they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D
data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D
multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in
3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view
fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel
approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for
open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent
noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while
enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D
features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features
encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize
multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with
14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in
image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets.
Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using
test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT
approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to
degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in
critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive
initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and
is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the
problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior
knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM);
(2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel
regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class
distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15
datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration
after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with
our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24),
6.78 for DiffTPT (CVPR'23), and 8.43 for PromptAlign (NeurIPS'23). The code is

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences
is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models
with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and
supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation
pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure
mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning
trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model
("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a
listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the
reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,
shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer
correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent
model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the
ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%
over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong
GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards
provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with
nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:

Abstract: Despite multiple view consistency offered by 3D-aware GAN techniques, the
resulting images often lack the capacity for localized editing. In response,
generative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained
point sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and
enabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a
novel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by
generating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent
codes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance
associated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In
contrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire
radiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial
semantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network
comprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic
radiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible
for predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial
settings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The
appearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent
codes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced
control. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in
semantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field
disentanglement.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) is a fundamental perception task in
intelligent transportation and security. To tackle this fine-grained task, most
existing methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute
information. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed
set of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance
and practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise
fine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common
characteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot
generalize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we
propose the \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\textbf{C}
g\textbf{U}ided under\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which
adaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute
individually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during
training. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to
capture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby
enriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the
Attribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages
textual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute
features from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that
textual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate
a Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes
within the same region to share consistent attention maps. Extensive
experiments on PA100K, PETA, and RAPv1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and strong generalization ability of our method.

million frames captured from UAVs, CCTV, and wearable cameras, the challenge
featured four international teams. These teams developed solutions ranging from
multi-stream architectures to transformer-based temporal reasoning and
physics-informed modeling. The leading approach, X-TFCLIP from UAM, attained
72.28% Rank-1 accuracy in the aerial-to-ground ReID setting and 70.77% in the

Abstract: We present Deep Mesh Denoising Network (DMD-Net), an end-to-end deep learning

Convolutional Neural Network in which aggregation is performed in both the
primal as well as the dual graph. This is realized in the form of an asymmetric
two-stream network, which contains a primal-dual fusion block that enables
communication between the primal-stream and the dual-stream. We develop a
Feature Guided Transformer (FGT) paradigm, which consists of a feature
extractor, a transformer, and a denoiser. The feature extractor estimates the
local features, that guide the transformer to compute a transformation, which
is applied to the noisy input mesh to obtain a useful intermediate
representation. This is further processed by the denoiser to obtain the
denoised mesh. Our network is trained on a large scale dataset of 3D objects.
We perform exhaustive ablation studies to demonstrate that each component in
our network is essential for obtaining the best performance. We show that our
method obtains competitive or better results when compared with the
state-of-the-art mesh denoising algorithms. We demonstrate that our method is
robust to various kinds of noise. We observe that even in the presence of
extremely high noise, our method achieves excellent performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual

enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but
is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies
TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object
segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,
comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second
stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model
(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract
region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable
online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and
generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate
our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements
in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality
inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly
enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional
semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect
detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic
segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class
activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of
existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient
detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),
which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas
with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a
region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,
pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance
iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively
bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect
segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial
scenarios.

transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of
spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we
propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces
visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent
optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal
pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and
1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the
overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into
a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates
temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong
performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key
visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and
spatiotemporal consistency.

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA,
directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an
undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics,
thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue,
we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text
pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information
processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a
pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into
point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are
refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic
grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden
states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and
visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy
synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision
from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks,
including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and
video question answering. Our codes are available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Contrastive learning has the capacity to model multimodal probability
distributions by embedding and aligning visual representations with semantics
from captions. This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic
similarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute
semantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness
metric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning
model; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image
samples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a
concept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its
application to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how
conditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and
vice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's
empirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain
scores often correspond to placeholder icons such as "image not found."
Furthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to
estimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram
with Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured
using either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation
with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining
the mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of
this method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with
publicly available, open-weight models.

Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for
multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple
agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception
performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs
to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to
attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a
unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which
is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately
detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key
idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego
agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a
probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a
subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior
probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative
consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)
segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its
collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In
addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to
dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the
reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical
decision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.
Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they
often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation
addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but
risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning
capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing
approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.
However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is
particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel
multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions
and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the
query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.
Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to
augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation
demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IMU systems suffer from orientation estimation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, which limits their real-world applications.

Method: MagShield uses a 'detect-then-correct' strategy: it detects magnetic disturbances through multi-IMU joint analysis and corrects orientation errors using human motion priors.

Result: Experiments show MagShield significantly improves motion capture accuracy under magnetic interference and works well with various sparse inertial MoCap systems.

Conclusion: MagShield is a compatible solution that enhances the performance of sparse inertial MoCap systems in magnetic disturbance conditions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method called MagShield, designed to address the
issue of magnetic interference in sparse inertial motion capture (MoCap)
systems. Existing Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) systems are prone to
orientation estimation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, limiting
their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address this problem,
MagShield employs a "detect-then-correct" strategy, first detecting magnetic
disturbances through multi-IMU joint analysis, and then correcting orientation
errors using human motion priors. MagShield can be integrated with most
existing sparse inertial MoCap systems, improving their performance in
magnetically disturbed environments. Experimental results demonstrate that
MagShield significantly enhances the accuracy of motion capture under magnetic
interference and exhibits good compatibility across different sparse inertial
MoCap systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique
that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of
parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover
``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch
embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's
self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key
and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,
respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for
learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,
de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before
learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch
embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt
to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly
accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on
the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the
bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,
low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields
the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT
methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count
and computation overhead.

Abstract: The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more
subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are
frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such
content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies
that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We
introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs
region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection,
and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support
generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements
model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench,
a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing
real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic
manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance
interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in
classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in
explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic,

several apps, reaching a high degree of accuracy in SC from distant observation
data has demonstrated to be difficult. This is because traditional conventional

Abstract: A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026,
up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising
concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a
force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of
generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any
single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the
watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns
remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to
tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely.
Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced
visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks,
resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI,
the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking
technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving
its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI
strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel
frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter
reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded
watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All
relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no
video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes.
While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong
open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to
capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained
activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video
classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model
generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames
using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any
video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the
extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only
61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using
approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured
language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable
and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of
vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

Abstract: Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a
segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while
maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve
generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.
However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,
limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,
particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we
propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over
multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive
prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype
calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable
visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive
representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning
techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these
calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and
uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to
limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental
results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed
FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS
and class-incremental setting. The code is available at

(2) Investigate cross-image transferability by learning universal

mechanisms to improve generalization. Our evaluation across prominent VLMs --
including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP as well as extended experiments on

for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it
was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition
patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides
two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed
by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition
type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples,
presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author,
being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as
grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the
users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces'
metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images
are included for further analysis.

Abstract: Collecting pixel-level labels for medical datasets can be a laborious and
expensive process, and enhancing segmentation performance with a scarcity of
labeled data is a crucial challenge. This work introduces AugPaint, a data
augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs
from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known
for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead,
and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for
retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the
area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising
process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled
in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach
ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting
it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve
as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models,
effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical
image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results
across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art
label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation
performance.

*Hung Nguyen,An Le,Runfa Li,Truong Nguyen*

TL;DR: AutoOpti3DGS is a framework that controls Gaussian proliferation in 3DGS without reducing visual quality, using wavelet transforms and an orthogonality loss to create sparser representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of increasing Gaussian primitives in 3DGS, which causes memory and bandwidth strain, while maintaining visual fidelity.

Method: The method involves using Forward and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transforms with fixed low-pass filters, learnable high-pass filters initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss to activate fine frequencies gradually.

Result: The result shows that AutoOpti3DGS can produce sparser scene representations with only one hyper-parameter, improving compatibility with memory-constrained hardware.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that AutoOpti3DGS effectively manages Gaussian proliferation, enabling efficient 3DGS training and rendering without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view
synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an
ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We
introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains
Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to
feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete
Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters
are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss
gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine
process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to
capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through
extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate
hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks,
and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with
memory or storage-constrained hardware.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the
initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries
of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Empowering Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) with reliable thinking
capabilities remains fundamentally challenging due to their limited parameter
capacity and weak instruction-following abilities. Existing training paradigms,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding
the capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to
SVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,
ultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A
natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity
to reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted
two-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency
toward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of
the combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm
that Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via
RLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes
to the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that
DyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial
performance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and
effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years,
yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness,
generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding
paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel
segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during
transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the
CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,
CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters
with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By
modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the
selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a
general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can
adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the
embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation
indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across
multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves
significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera
attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

Motivation: The challenge of reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles from single-view images due to their complex structures and existing methods' limitations in capturing fine details.

Method: A novel unsupervised pipeline utilizing a synthetic braid model inspired by braid theory to capture intricate intertwined structures.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with superior accuracy, realism, and efficiency in 3D braided hair reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed approach supports expressive hairstyle modeling in digital humans by effectively handling complex braid structures.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles from single-view images remains a
challenging task due to the intricate interwoven structure and complex

typically focus on loose hairstyles and often struggle to capture the
fine-grained geometry of braided hair. In this paper, we propose a novel
unsupervised pipeline for efficiently reconstructing 3D braided hair from
single-view RGB images. Leveraging a synthetic braid model inspired by braid
theory, our approach effectively captures the complex intertwined structures of
braids. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms

TL;DR: The paper introduces CDAL, a method for open-world model attribution that models causal relationships between attention maps and model source, decoupling artifacts from confounding biases to improve performance on novel attacks with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for open-world model attribution are limited by handcrafted region partitioning or feature space designs, which are susceptible to spurious correlations and fail with novel attacks.

Method: CDAL explicitly models causal relationships between attentional visual traces and source model attribution, counterfactually decoupling model-specific artifacts from source biases to quantify attention map quality.

Result: CDAL achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on open-world benchmarks with minimal computational overhead, especially for unseen novel attacks.

Conclusion: CDAL provides a causal approach to model attribution in open-world scenarios, enhancing generalization by decoupling confounding factors and focusing on essential generation patterns.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning
(CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on
handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be
confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel
attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the
causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model
attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific
artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the
resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned
attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation
patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.
Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show
that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel
attacks. Source code: https://github.com/yzheng97/CDAL.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily
focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than
enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the
target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic
research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem,
we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs
multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial
resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical
retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due
to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this
problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than
conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic
Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns
feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing
multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both
hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization
accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at

Abstract: Automated and accurate segmentation of individual vertebra in 3D CT and MRI
images is essential for various clinical applications. Due to the limitations
of current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing
methods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and
distinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a
Frequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the
accuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet
transform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred
images. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed
separately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency
Feature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter
out noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the
low-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)
to aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,
extracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies
with linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is
essential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.

Abstract: Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both
autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict
where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the
cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which
limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that
jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics
(what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To
support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver
attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and
causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal
conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further
propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention
prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive
reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets
and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper
understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for
autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer
interaction.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object
boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its
promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains
or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects).
To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation
(TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user
interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate
all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent
subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This
Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables
more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified
predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset.
Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA
significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods,
effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with
fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for simplifying multi-stroke characters like Chinese and Japanese by removing strokes while keeping them readable, showing that even with fewer strokes, characters can still be recognized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce learning difficulties for non-native speakers and improve legibility in font design and communication systems by simplifying complex multi-stroke characters.

Method: The method involves using a highly accurate character recognition model to evaluate legibility and selectively remove strokes that have the least impact on readability.

Result: Experiments on 1,256 character classes with varying stroke counts (5, 10, 15, 20) showed that many characters remain distinguishable even after multiple strokes are removed.

Conclusion: The results indicate that there is potential for developing more formalized and systematic strategies for simplifying multi-stroke characters without compromising legibility.

Abstract: Multi-stroke characters in scripts such as Chinese and Japanese can be highly
complex, posing significant challenges for both native speakers and,
especially, non-native learners. If these characters can be simplified without
degrading their legibility, it could reduce learning barriers for non-native
speakers, facilitate simpler and legible font designs, and contribute to
efficient character-based communication systems. In this paper, we propose a
framework to systematically simplify multi-stroke characters by selectively
removing strokes while preserving their overall legibility. More specifically,
we use a highly accurate character recognition model to assess legibility and
remove those strokes that minimally impact it. Experimental results on 1,256
character classes with 5, 10, 15, and 20 strokes reveal several key findings,
including the observation that even after removing multiple strokes, many
characters remain distinguishable. These findings suggest the potential for
more formalized simplification strategies.

Abstract: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is vital to assess the risk of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the small size and high
intra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a
combination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical
practice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification
methods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the
importance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement
Framework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and
Category-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.
First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based
method for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,
we propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's
global modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and
diverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded
down-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve
implicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free
mixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class
clustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling
at the Category level. Experimental results indicate that CVC-RF effectively
models global features via multi-level refinement, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in the challenging CPG task.

Motivation: To address limitations in current multimodal embedding models such as suboptimal causal attention, scalability issues with labeled data, and limited training diversity.

Method: MoCa uses Modality-aware Continual Pre-training with joint reconstruction and Heterogeneous Contrastive Fine-tuning with diverse multimodal data.

Result: MoCa improves performance on MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results and showing strong scalability.

Conclusion: MoCa effectively transforms VLMs into better embedding models by addressing key limitations through its two-stage approach.

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs),
have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key
limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for
embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled
paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training
objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage
framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional
multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual
Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously
denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional
context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive
Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple
image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method
addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through
continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via
joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for
enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa
consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,
achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with
both model size and training data on MMEB.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable

large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter
challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial
reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such
as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we
propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based
segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by
decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying
relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated
visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets
in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based
segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation
samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud
perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they
can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

Abstract: Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists'

plagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving
visually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a
dataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions
using generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a
baseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model
DINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify
plagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned
method achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\% but suffers from low
retrieval precision 29.0\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval
quality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and
negative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly
improves retrieval performance by 12\% AP over the baseline, though it
unexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\%). We conclude with
insightful discussions and outline directions for future research.

Abstract: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence,

physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances
3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning
that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material
characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and
physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its
practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy

Abstract: Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred
prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models
often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on
text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and
aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic
alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually
appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose
VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines
user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter
utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts
in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to
revise the prompts in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our VisualPrompter, which achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks for text-image alignment evaluation.
Additionally, our framework features a plug-and-play design, making it highly
adaptable to various generative models.

Abstract: Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and
reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by
pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC),
significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods
attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the
multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable
reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce
AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D
generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict
regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed
multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution,
establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated
images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to
explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct
objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only
enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as
few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC,
seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D
reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the
cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution
(FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical
flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame
estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU
memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely
positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for
cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from
RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and
high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially
reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive
alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness
for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method
ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,
leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the
best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%. The code is available at

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge.
Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield
impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion
parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes
limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods
encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry
and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior
methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To
address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth
Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align
with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use
depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the
expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample
points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce
constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object
boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the
correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a
visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at
the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera
parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to
camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion
input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning
representations through comparison methods that align with human intuition.
However, mainstream SSL methods heavily rely on high body datasets with single
label, such as ImageNet, resulting in intolerable pre-training overhead.
Besides, more general multi-label images are frequently overlooked in SSL,
despite their potential for richer semantic information and broader
applicability in downstream scenarios. Therefore, we tailor the mainstream SSL
approach to guarantee excellent representation learning capabilities using
fewer multi-label images. Firstly, we propose a block-wise augmentation module
aimed at extracting additional potential positive view pairs from multi-label
images. Subsequently, an image-aware contrastive loss is devised to establish
connections between these views, thereby facilitating the extraction of
semantically consistent representations. Comprehensive linear fine-tuning and
transfer learning validate the competitiveness of our approach despite
challenging sample quality and quantity.

Abstract: High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with
rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous
spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified
representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal
features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm
fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame
imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.
To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various
latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between
background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate
for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting
framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we
figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in
frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal
features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between
background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that
Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal
characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal
disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the
cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal
discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous
dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly
sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a
significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media
integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models,
predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often
falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to
this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection
framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for
enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is
trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,
capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from
manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance
generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery
discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards
forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen
manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head
to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to
certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will
release our code in a GitHub repository.

Conclusion: DEL provides an effective solution for dense semantic action localization, enhancing both high-level semantics and fine-grained details through its modules, leading to state-of-the-art performance in multimodal video analysis.

Abstract: Real-world videos often contain overlapping events and complex temporal

Abstract: The person search task aims to locate a target person within a set of scene
images. In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some
progress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the
self-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the
features, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost
of transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel
High-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person
search. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction
capabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and
improving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that
progressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our
model enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from
augmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore,
we replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based
on multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not
only lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of
high-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a
conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising
network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to
guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based
distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the
optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,
performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,
limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these
challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion
via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two
aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport
problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete
shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a
Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D
shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth
information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric
structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative
latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and
enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape
achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion
benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for
unseen object classes.

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the
understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data
types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them
comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model
designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong
performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In
$\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset
encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from
location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a
multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement
from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and
downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.
Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results
from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms
open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex
cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM
systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy
reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking
undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with
severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we
propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel
tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality
mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable
pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust
geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric
Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary
geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose
estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For
mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes
geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized
Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust
mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on
multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior
RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our
method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory
Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The
implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is critical in clinical

Abstract: This paper investigates indoor point cloud semantic segmentation under
scene-level annotation, which is less explored compared to methods relying on
sparse point-level labels. In the absence of precise point-level labels,
current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used
to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for
each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable
challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to
enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation
framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point
semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module,
our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with
corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning.
To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we
introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional
semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics,
which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions.
Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate
point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality
pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and
S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our
approach's individual components. The code is available at

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and

understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use
surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with
other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as
meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has
explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are
either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high
computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we
introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural
Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of
learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,
significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving
expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model
COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,
and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact
modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging
tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,
(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)
scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our
results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and
efficiency gains.

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how
models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on
local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which
visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However,
reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is
infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local
behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a
method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.
SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency
maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model
relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance
on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance
sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of
saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named
segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and
overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and
debugging image classifiers.

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a

introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference

Abstract: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for
users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge
communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication
latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is
only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is
proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)
events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI
process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event
locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are
classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.
Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a
communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help
users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a
located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is
designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called
the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show
its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each
leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL
event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their
simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by
analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A
supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the
efficiency of their simulations.

that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their
related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a
novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic
accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion,
Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify
the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason
answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we
further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M
frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show
that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms
of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident
video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video
generation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various
fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less
explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective
visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that
produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,
where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier
context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the
explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies
often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant
correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address
this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the
interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel
rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method
Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions
between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens
of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single
prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,
showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various
scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video
visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,
shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The

Abstract: We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple
and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer
models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the
output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a
lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in
parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer
into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained
knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens
can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event
localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained
segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a
\textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual
meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature
adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and
training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Abstract: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and
social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond
traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware
multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and
visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic
features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies
semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the
identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple
modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of
the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)
summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such
as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.
Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore
from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework
improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of
multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed
video summaries.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world
applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency
requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with
specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their
generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more
challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate
sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user
instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce
$\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,
providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we
propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user
instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective
evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and
generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free
framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'
in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both
image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive
experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all
existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current
generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the
ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming
its substantial practical value. Visit our project in

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks
to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based
paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and
detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods
are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned
distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps
uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,
we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score
matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function
by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and
assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input
sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate
unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score
matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting
intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the
corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original
data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an
enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all
three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator.
Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing methods that process spatial and temporal information separately, leading to an incomplete capture of video dynamics.

Result: MoMa achieves superior performance on multiple video benchmarks with reduced computational cost, demonstrating its effectiveness in video understanding.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that MoMa provides an efficient and effective solution for video understanding by integrating spatial-temporal modeling into IFMs.

Abstract: Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling
of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models
(IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most
of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately,
which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper,
we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full
spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling
into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal
information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features.
By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances
video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa,

At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory
system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists
of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a
spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By
integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social

dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer
vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods
demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing
a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In
this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed,
e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve
generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of
multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to
the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks
across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive
distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as
a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.
Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task
and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to
improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic
perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce
mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The
experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising
performance in diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake
content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an
essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection
models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods
only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In
critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the
credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the
interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation
masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of
these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most
current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few
datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted
forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data
scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this
predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and
localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged
samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL
design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery
Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied
Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$.
Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging
benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for
building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability
methods. The DDL dataset project page is on

Abstract: Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong
capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the
development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable
such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be
addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion
modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the
second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.
Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal
motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling
motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective
cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve
language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and
parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is
integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information
flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this
continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly
from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete
tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive
performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving
strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion
framework within an autoregressive manner.

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing

While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved
visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained
garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining
inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To
address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent
diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a
progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware
garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained
deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via
a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment,
the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality
rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit
effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and
visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as
textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the
human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate
that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in

techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic
surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in
scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure.
Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization
problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we
present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive
Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven
lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively
models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware
enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a
spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness
adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior
rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while
maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control
loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for
illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that
Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art
reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments,
underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications. Our

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from
arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets.
Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they
often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation
bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial
features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local
details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of
iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose
FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of
reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg
performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the
segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a
dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction,
(ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused
cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time
Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive
experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free
performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context,
and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for
extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference
efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown
promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the
practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without
explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the
discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based
frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder
decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during
adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using
Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook
selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby
preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation,
we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as
image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale
source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based
conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the
target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling
iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation
synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental
findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior
translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step
mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative
results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised
image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

Abstract: The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with

City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient
hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic
information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,
distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)
Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as
area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language
models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate
GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess
performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging
tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.
Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D
language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our

Motivation: Infrared images are crucial for autonomous driving in bad weather but have low contrast, especially for non-heat-emitting targets, which harms high-level vision tasks. Noise amplification and information loss are also issues.

Method: The method includes layer decomposition to enhance scene details while preserving dark regions and a morphological reconstruction-based saliency extraction to enhance targets without noise amplification.

Result: The approach improves image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation, outperforming existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses contrast enhancement in infrared images for autonomous driving, maintaining details and reducing noise, leading to better performance in vision tasks.

Abstract: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous
driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light.
However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in
non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the
performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving
contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information
remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented
infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components:
layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an
layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details
while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent
saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological
reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and
enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the
image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in multi-subject video customization by creating a data pipeline and developing a method that uses control signals like depth, mask, camera, and text prompts effectively.

Method: The paper proposes VideoCus-Factory for data construction and IVTM training with image editing data, along with OmniVCus framework featuring Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned Embedding (TAE).

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enables instructive editing of subjects in customized videos, with potential for broader applications through the provided project page and upcoming code release.

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study
single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject
training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals
such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject
in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose
a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs
for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control
signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our
constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with
image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the
customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus,
with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned
Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training
subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation
process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by
assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video
compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is
crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate
INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level
control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD
(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that
fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first
rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to
efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then
frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders
for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space
sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding
speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.
Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous
resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach
significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video
compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world
deployment. Our codebase is available at

Abstract: Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera
photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance
evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and
fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are
lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to
address this critical need. We designed a system comprising a test rig capable
of holding 12 smartphones for parallel testing, a method for generating
synthetic PPG test videos with controllable HR and signal quality, and a host
machine for coordinating video playback and data logging. The system achieved a
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11% +/- 0.001% between input and
measured HR, and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.008 between input and
measured PPG signals using a clinically-validated smartphone-based HR app.
Bench-testing results of 20 different smartphone models correctly classified
all the devices as meeting the ANSI/CTA accuracy standards for HR monitors
(MAPE <10%) when compared to a prospective clinical study with 80 participants,
demonstrating high positive predictive value. This platform offers a scalable
solution for pre-deployment testing of smartphone HR apps to improve app
performance, ensure device compatibility, and advance the field of mobile

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality,
realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional
generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the
input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment
of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images
that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input
prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework
for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging
the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we
make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,
PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D
spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human
judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time
method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I
models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based
reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a
gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during
the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of
initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to
traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure
of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore,
PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate
images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their
surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object
detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's
ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to
detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous
situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection
approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification
to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their
specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'
based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object
position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can
effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer
real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies
them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in
dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware
representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR
world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for
which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong
transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain
transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor
generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii)
non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data,
our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11%
absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms
training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of
dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data
for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic
occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required
by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models,
mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training
objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching
(CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than
that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on
future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x
more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA
performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more
computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

Motivation: The motivation is to address data scarcity in histopathology images due to privacy constraints by leveraging diagnostic text reports and masks, which provide semantic and spatial information, respectively.

Method: PathDiff integrates unpaired mask and text data into a unified conditioning space, allowing precise control over structural and contextual features in image generation.

Result: PathDiff generates high-quality, semantically accurate images and improves image fidelity, text-image alignment, and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that PathDiff effectively utilizes unpaired data to combine modalities for better control in image generation, showing superiority over existing methods through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing
histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints.
Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks
offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct
morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data
for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image
generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits
of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial
details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that
effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities
into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over
structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically
accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment,
and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei
segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels
often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However,
traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise
object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and
segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as
an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong
image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By
modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related
objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps
generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse
diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with
Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to
train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a
low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate
gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify
foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for
contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental
results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant
iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image
by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both
images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,
i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image
inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content
distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such
an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image
by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the
reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to
achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address
such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution
Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the
time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of
damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP
solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven
Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and
conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack
of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,
based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the
TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting
settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided
image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily
dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However,
large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and
web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This
problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining
high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces
Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a
vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in
multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and
their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the
CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by
computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization
is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,
and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing
image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.
Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,
followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels
into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels
from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves
label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label
vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality
for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with
minimal human intervention.

Motivation: CLIP models, while effective in medical image classification, have not been sufficiently examined for fairness issues like demographic biases, leading to disparities in diagnostics for underrepresented groups.

Method: AdFair-CLIP uses adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, reducing spurious correlations and enhancing prediction fairness.

Result: Experiments on CXR datasets demonstrate that AdFair-CLIP improves fairness and diagnostic accuracy without compromising zero-shot and few-shot generalization.

Conclusion: AdFair-CLIP sets new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based medical diagnostic models, especially for CXR analysis.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated
superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image
classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have
received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical
issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities
in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To
address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing
adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby
mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that
AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while
maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These
results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based

Result: Experiments show GeoCD consistently enhances reconstruction quality over standard CD across different architectures and datasets, with significant improvements even after a single epoch of fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GeoCD is a promising alternative to Chamfer Distance for 3D point cloud learning, offering better performance by incorporating topological awareness and being fully differentiable.

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is a widely adopted metric in 3D point cloud learning
due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it suffers from a fundamental
limitation: it relies solely on Euclidean distances, which often fail to
capture the intrinsic geometry of 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we
propose GeoCD, a topology-aware and fully differentiable approximation of
geodesic distance designed to serve as a metric for 3D point cloud learning.
Our experiments show that GeoCD consistently improves reconstruction quality
over standard CD across various architectures and datasets. We demonstrate this
by fine-tuning several models, initially trained with standard CD, using GeoCD.
Remarkably, fine-tuning for a single epoch with GeoCD yields significant gains
across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has demonstrated remarkable advances in

GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate this

entropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable and
self-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting.
Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian
representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparable
rendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time.
Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points based
on image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice.
Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceeds
GaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shorter
training times. Specifically, our method reduces the training time by up to one
order of magnitude while achieving superior rendering performance with the same

Abstract: Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range
of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical
concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the
geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or
captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing
serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other
security threats.
  Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation
techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and
evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on
geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view
imagery.
  Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large
models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to
$49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the
models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues
from visual data.
  Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual
elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text,
architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the
potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and

Conclusion: The conclusion is that MTADiffusion effectively improves image inpainting by enhancing semantic alignment, structural stability, and style consistency.

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled image inpainting models to

this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model
designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the
inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for
annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we
construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text
pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates
both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To
promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss

consumer-grade hardware, Qwen-GUI-3B delivers strong grounding accuracy while
being fully trainable on a single GPU (RTX 4090). The model incorporates
several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset
of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI
screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop
environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial
cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by
specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model
adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,
demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy
achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity
over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding
benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging
ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9%
on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B
parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling
and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in
high-resolution desktop scenarios. The Qwen-GUI-3B is available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as
CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved
remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level
visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained
details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.
Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual
representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level
alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to
perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships
between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained
action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware
multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external
knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an
action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional
semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in
LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate
attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for
establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which
further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is crucial for autonomous navigation,
environmental monitoring, and marine exploration, but it is severely hampered
by light attenuation, turbidity, and occlusion. Current methods balance
accuracy and computational efficiency, but they have trouble deploying in
real-time under low visibility conditions. Through the integration of
physics-informed augmentation techniques with the YOLOv12 architecture, this
study advances underwater detection. With Residual ELAN blocks to preserve
structural features in turbid waters and Area Attention to maintain large
receptive fields for occluded objects while reducing computational complexity.
Underwater optical properties are addressed by domain-specific augmentations
such as turbulence adaptive blurring, biologically grounded occlusion
simulation, and spectral HSV transformations for color distortion. Extensive
tests on four difficult datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
Brackish data registering 98.30% mAP at 142 FPS. YOLOv12 improves occlusion
robustness by 18.9%, small-object recall by 22.4%, and detection precision by
up to 7.94% compared to previous models. The crucial role of augmentation
strategy is validated by ablation studies. This work offers a precise and
effective solution for conservation and underwater robotics applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to generate high-quality panoramic videos due to the modality gap between panoramic data and the majority of available perspective data used in diffusion models.

Method: The paper proposes a framework that uses pretrained perspective video models, a ViewPoint map for panoramic representation, and a Pano-Perspective attention mechanism to capture spatial correlations.

Result: The method produces highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages pretrained perspective models and novel representations to advance panoramic video generation.

Abstract: Panoramic video generation aims to synthesize 360-degree immersive videos,
holding significant importance in the fields of VR, world models, and spatial
intelligence. Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos
due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data,
which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion
models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained
perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we
design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses
global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With
our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from
pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations
of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.

Result: The method improves view consistency across various diffusion models, showing broader applicability through a comprehensive metric framework for novel-view datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively ensures view consistency in image generation without additional modules, offering a more efficient solution compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Generating high-quality novel views of a scene from a single image requires
maintaining structural coherence across different views, referred to as view
consistency. While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view
synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views.
Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but
such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This
paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes
diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance
diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention
manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to
ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable
for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency
across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient
object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video
and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency
masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are
more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of
human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to
assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the
one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided
by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to
provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On
the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak
supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A
Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality
constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate
object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed
Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities
under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive
learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks
indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation
metrics.

Motivation: Traditional vision-based systems struggle with complex environments using single-image inputs. Temporal data like past frames or steering sequences can help, but existing methods are too resource-heavy for practical use and federated learning.

Method: Introduces lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices to reduce model complexity and enable efficient weight updates and real-time predictions.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show the method outperforms recent approaches and achieves real-time performance. Real robot experiments confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances autonomous driving performance by efficiently leveraging temporal information, making it suitable for real-time applications and federated learning.

Abstract: Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems often face difficulties
in navigating complex environments when relying solely on single-image inputs.
To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image
frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and
adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods
exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them
impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address
these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a
method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by
breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces
model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and
real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance
autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin
while achieving real-time performance. Additionally, real robot experiments
further confirm the effectiveness of our method.

<details>

Motivation: Existing TTA methods are ineffective when applied to self-supervised models with low source domain accuracy, highlighting the need for a TTA protocol that doesn't depend on source pretraining.

Method: The authors introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol and a collaborative learning framework that uses contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for iterative representation refinement.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates competitive performance in SSL without source pretraining, validated across multiple models and TTA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The research shows that TTA can continuously enhance SSL models, offering a promising approach for online adaptation in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic
environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online
adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly
reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we
investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve
models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source
pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that
existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised
models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a
collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging
contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation
refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including
DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive
performance even without source pretraining.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GVIT, a classification framework that uses learnable 2D Gaussians instead of traditional pixel or patch grids, achieving high accuracy with a standard ViT architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to replace conventional pixel or patch grid inputs with a more compact and efficient representation using 2D Gaussians, which can potentially improve performance and reduce computational complexity.

Method: The method involves encoding each image as a set of learnable 2D Gaussians, optimizing their parameters (position, scale, orientation, color, opacity) jointly with a ViT classifier. The classifier gradients guide the Gaussians to focus on class-salient regions, while a differentiable renderer handles image reconstruction loss.

Result: GVIT achieves 76.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k using a ViT-B architecture, matching the performance of traditional patch-based ViTs with a more compact representation.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that using 2D Gaussian input representations with GVIT guidance can effectively match the performance of traditional methods while offering a more efficient and compact approach.

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional
pixel or patch grid input representations in favor of a compact set of
learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose
positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly
with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the
classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward
class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations
coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture,
closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a
76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k using a ViT-B architecture.

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage,

traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane,
providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs

guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation
to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based
framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from
redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to
reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for
coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for
overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise,
requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either
focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without
considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph
fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness.
Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit
temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph
fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and
data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum
a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into
iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed
geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic
DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PPFlow, a pyramidal patchification flow approach for diffusion transformers that uses varying patch sizes across timesteps, improving inference speed and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to adjust the number of tokens input to DiT blocks to manage computation cost, by using different patch sizes at different noise levels instead of a fixed size.

Method: PPFlow employs varying patch sizes for high and low noise timesteps, learns linear projections for each patch size, and modifies the unpatchify process. It operates on full latent representations without requiring a renoising trick.

Result: -

Conclusion: PPFlow demonstrates effectiveness in improving inference speed and training efficiency, achieving better performance with less training time when starting from pretrained DiTs.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations
to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of
tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single
patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow
(PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and
small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for
each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow,
our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid
representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the
renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two
training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$)
inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with
slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance.
Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with
small training time. The code and checkpoint are at

Motivation: The motivation is to propose a new algorithm for multi-style image enhancement that can handle multiple tasks efficiently.

Method: Oneta uses two point operators: intensity enhancement with a transformation function (TF) and color correction with a color correction matrix (CCM). It employs eigentransformation function (eigenTF) for compact representation and K learnable tokens for supporting K styles.

Result: Oneta achieves high performance in six enhancement tasks across 30 datasets using a single network.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that Oneta is effective for multi-style image enhancement with its simple two-step model and learnable tokens.

Abstract: The first algorithm, called Oneta, for a novel task of multi-style image
enhancement is proposed in this work. Oneta uses two point operators
sequentially: intensity enhancement with a transformation function (TF) and
color correction with a color correction matrix (CCM). This two-step
enhancement model, though simple, achieves a high performance upper bound.
Also, we introduce eigentransformation function (eigenTF) to represent TF
compactly. The Oneta network comprises Y-Net and C-Net to predict eigenTF and
CCM parameters, respectively. To support $K$ styles, Oneta employs $K$
learnable tokens. During training, each style token is learned using image
pairs from the corresponding dataset. In testing, Oneta selects one of the $K$
style tokens to enhance an image accordingly. Extensive experiments show that
the single Oneta network can effectively undertake six enhancement tasks --
retouching, image signal processing, low-light image enhancement, dehazing,
underwater image enhancement, and white balancing -- across 30 datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR)
algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite
its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard
samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular
or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition
hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an
overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss
function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).
Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density
Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability
distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification
method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is
implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to
apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their
representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that
optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is
superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving
49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method
by 2.37%.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features
into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully
data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance.
Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they
can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation.
However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use
them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the
performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when
rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric
radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding
background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields
(OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering
foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to
enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention
(HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately
via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP
and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available at

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by
the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high
costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder
applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and
agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.
In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image
super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet
transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel
metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates
embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,
and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the
hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively
reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This
process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,
boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for
detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across
multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent
approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID
and LPIPS.

Abstract: Small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV task is a challenging problem due to
the small size of UAVs and complex backgrounds. Traditional frame-based cameras
struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame
rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with
microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more
effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection
datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse
backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we
introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),
the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes
147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring
extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse
scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore,
based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in
spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation
Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud
space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion
continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive

The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts
by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object
textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar
objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific
linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them
based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to
deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly
boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt
framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further
improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module,
which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt
learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks.
Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly
detection and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) condenses large datasets into compact yet
informative substitutes, preserving performance comparable to the original
dataset while reducing storage, transmission costs, and computational
consumption. However, previous DD methods mainly focus on distilling
information from images, often overlooking the semantic information inherent in
the data. The disregard for context hinders the model's generalization ability,
particularly in tasks involving complex datasets, which may result in illogical
outputs or the omission of critical objects. In this study, we integrate
vision-language methods into DD by introducing text prototypes to distill
language information and collaboratively synthesize data with image prototypes,
thereby enhancing dataset distillation performance. Notably, the text
prototypes utilized in this study are derived from descriptive text information
generated by an open-source large language model. This framework demonstrates
broad applicability across datasets without pre-existing text descriptions,
expanding the potential of dataset distillation beyond traditional image-based
approaches. Compared to other methods, the proposed approach generates
logically coherent images containing target objects, achieving state-of-the-art
validation performance and demonstrating robust generalization. Source code and

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive
applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors
can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches
and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats.
Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense
against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the
$l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically
realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early
attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT
against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this
work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with
a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite
Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the
combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible
global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,
PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also
unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive
experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved
robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art
defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over
previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAI, a training-free method to reduce object hallucination in LVLMs by using attention patterns from caption queries, achieving SOTA results with low inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce content that doesn't match visual data, causing hallucinations. Existing solutions are costly or slow.

Method: CAI uses attention activation patterns from caption queries to improve visual perception without needing additional training.

Result: CAI performs well on four benchmarks for both discriminative and generative tasks with minimal extra inference time.

Conclusion: CAI is effective and efficient for reducing hallucinations in LVLMs, offering better performance than previous methods.

Abstract: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce
content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination.
To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and
training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we
observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger
when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by
this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a
training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the
attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs'
visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four
benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that
CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only
with minimal additional inference cost.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SynLecSlideGen, a pipeline for generating synthetic lecture slides using large language models, and creates a real-world benchmark, RealSlide, to evaluate their effectiveness. Experiments show that using synthetic data for pre-training improves few-shot transfer learning performance on real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the need for extensive manual annotation of lecture slides by generating synthetic slides that can be used for pre-training models, thus addressing the challenge of limited labeled data in this domain.

Method: The method involves a synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline called SynLecSlideGen, which leverages large language models to create high-quality, coherent, and realistic slides. Additionally, the paper introduces RealSlide, a manually annotated benchmark of 1,050 real lecture slides for evaluation purposes.

Result: The results demonstrate that models pre-trained on synthetic slides achieve better performance in few-shot transfer learning tasks on real data compared to models trained only on real data, showing that synthetic data can effectively supplement limited labeled datasets.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that synthetic lecture slides generated by SynLecSlideGen are effective for pre-training models, leading to improved performance in tasks requiring few-shot learning on real-world lecture slides. The work is made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide
understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on
extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture
slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain
expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided
synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces
high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation
benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides.
To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer
learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results
show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides
significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This
demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled
lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on

Abstract: Lidar point cloud synthesis based on generative models offers a promising
solution to augment deep learning pipelines, particularly when real-world data
is scarce or lacks diversity. By enabling flexible object manipulation, this
synthesis approach can significantly enrich training datasets and enhance
discriminative models. However, existing methods focus on unconditional lidar
point cloud generation, overlooking their potential for real-world
applications. In this paper, we propose SG-LDM, a Semantic-Guided Lidar
Diffusion Model that employs latent alignment to enable robust
semantic-to-lidar synthesis. By directly operating in the native lidar space
and leveraging explicit semantic conditioning, SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generating high-fidelity lidar point clouds guided by semantic
labels. Moreover, we propose the first diffusion-based lidar translation
framework based on SG-LDM, which enables cross-domain translation as a domain
adaptation strategy to enhance downstream perception performance. Systematic
experiments demonstrate that SG-LDM significantly outperforms existing lidar
diffusion models and the proposed lidar translation framework further improves
data augmentation performance in the downstream lidar segmentation task.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise
3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted
from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat
multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary
information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view
correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose
PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for
improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in
a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on
partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple
geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs
via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we
leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation
foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,
offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency
module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints
and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model
on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more
complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and
generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the
semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D
environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS
benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in
open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in
texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in
3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a
novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point
clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from
randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric
attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training
progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and
enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to
guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in
scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves
the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world
applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional promise in
the video super-resolution (VSR) task, achieving a substantial advancement in
detail generation relative to prior methods. However, these approaches face
significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current
techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p
video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based
video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)
We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8
to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial
challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the
learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;
subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the
high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We
convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer
sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs
on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking
only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports
image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient
design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image
SR show surprising fine details.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound-producing objects in
video frames based on the associated audio signal. Prevailing AVS methods
typically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries
are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer
from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio,
and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address
these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework
that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio
and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between
different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their
contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation
(PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that
are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting
and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new
state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset. The
code is available at https://github.com/spyflying/VCT_AVS.

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive
processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise
and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient
outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include
biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and
the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in
automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical
images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have
limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,
and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our
research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The
novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model
which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient
decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate
results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

Abstract: Diffusion models have dramatically advanced text-to-image generation in
recent years, translating abstract concepts into high-fidelity images with
remarkable ease. In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct
concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new
visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending
merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts)
into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We
investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the
diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or
layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse
concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound
words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we
show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities
without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving
100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios:
each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like
prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome.
These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion
models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of effectively aligning different modalities in MLLMs, aiming to enhance their ability to capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual information.

Result: The result shows improved performance in diverse vision-language tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework in bridging visual and textual representations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed approach advances the development of more capable and efficient multimodal foundation models by effectively aligning modalities through unified tokenization.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities
remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal
understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method
directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring
successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a
priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial
consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on
curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer
model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual
information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across
diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual
representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying
factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to
produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin
lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis,
such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions
are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed
Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from
pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality
and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from
MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following
Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic,
colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during
training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions
are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover,
to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test
time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings
to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of
medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

Abstract: Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral

diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these
approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to
suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an
automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color
Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature
mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical
realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis
as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships
between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification
mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR
grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a
feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the
representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated
our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases
with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised
video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg
demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at:

Result: Evaluation of various contrastive vision-language architectures across six domains showed significant variability in robustness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that domain-aware evaluation is necessary and releases Deepbench as open-source to support further research.

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely
on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions,
despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While
these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their
effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as
unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we
introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness
of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model
(LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to
specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization
capability of modern machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant
computational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate
training by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on
gradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient
back-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial
Forward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.
The efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample
importance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of
the target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the
retained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss
back-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational
overhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,
while also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy
model training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of
sample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,
our method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the
constantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB
achieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%
data pruned.

TL;DR: This paper proposes P3B, a new pruning method for Vision Transformers that improves transfer learning performance by considering block-level contributions and maintaining accuracy even with high sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers are powerful but computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for resource-limited hardware. Pruning is needed to reduce complexity, but existing methods fail when applied to unseen data domains due to inaccurate weight significance evaluation.

Method: P3B (Pruning by Block Benefit) prunes the model by evaluating the relative contribution of each block to global performance, setting layerwise keep ratios to preserve critical components and allow reactivation of late-converging blocks.

Result: P3B achieves state-of-the-art pruning results, maintaining high accuracy even with 70% parameter reduction (only 0.64% loss in accuracy) and showing significant improvements in transfer learning tasks.

Conclusion: P3B effectively addresses the challenges of pruning Vision Transformers on unseen domains by focusing on block-level contributions, enabling efficient model deployment without major performance loss.

Abstract: Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models
come with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for
resource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity
by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,
pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight
significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we
find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature
representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early
pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block
Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on
block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact
components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.
Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.
In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance
metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in
extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most
noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve
high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction
while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based adversarial example generation is popular for image editing but has limited generalization beyond image classification tasks and struggles with transferability enhancement strategies.

Method: A unified framework that integrates traditional transferability enhancement techniques into diffusion model-based adversarial example generation.

Result: The method achieved first place in the ACM MM25 competition on adversarial attacks against deepfake detectors.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves transferability and applicability of adversarial examples across various downstream tasks, demonstrating strong potential in AI-generated media security areas.

Abstract: Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based
adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly
gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability
of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to
generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake
detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example
transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates
traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based
adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application
across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the
"1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of
AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness
of our approach.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of
human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving
arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing
approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn
new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or
''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve
complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the
model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the
visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended
action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new
motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic
guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the
dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and
motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features
while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the
visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a
pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal
coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy
which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported
by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This
strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across
diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark
with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V
settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines. Project page:

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during
inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such
on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large
target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical
scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current
methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the
volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a
Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time
adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through
uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in
the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three
publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor
segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound
supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art
methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly
share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet
framework, at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/muvi.git.

Abstract: We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that
reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use
of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes
dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the
user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective
perceptual expectations into photorealistic images.
  Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific
subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D
priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation.
Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose
impractical requirements on sketch precision.
  Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential
generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward
optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that
processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific
subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization
that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors
in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of
rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation
across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial
coherence.

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with
potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding
impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus
on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing
question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our
findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can
provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are
substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like
MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base
(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model
Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)
Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models
throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)
Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised
learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive
experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,
significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including
ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,
with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy
on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally
coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a
text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity
consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)
generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address
these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework
for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we
propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and
textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing
coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.
Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that
dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving
fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a
self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on
optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without
requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench,
a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150
individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity
preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors such as Grounding DINO are trained on vast

to that, it is unclear where to find their limitations, which is of major
concern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not
provide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model
generalization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to
systematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In
this work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge
open-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find
systematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design
two automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with
high diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and
ChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple
open-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The
synthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a
challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages
dataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary
object detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a
strong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on
object semantics. This provides a systematic approach to challenge
open-vocabulary models and gives valuable insights on how data could be
acquired to effectively improve these models.

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust
object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,
most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity
Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across
modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also
limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose
an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity
Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a
lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each
modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate
modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the
modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based
FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,
cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused
representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target
localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,
FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the
proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be

Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to

preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM
leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to
integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized
visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike
previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM,
maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in
few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across
open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote
sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct
high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth
observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods
have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior
performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR
observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world
complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover
changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image.
To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable
reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To
address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained
Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce
accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference,
we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both
local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel
dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference,
enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named
Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps,
thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we
introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing
images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land
cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on
Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and
semantic segmentation.

Abstract: A recent series of works has shown that initialization-free BA can be
achieved using pseudo Object Space Error (pOSE) as a surrogate objective. The
initial reconstruction-step optimizes an objective where all terms are
projectively invariant and it cannot incorporate knowledge of the camera
calibration. As a result, the solution is only determined up to a projective
transformation of the scene and the process requires more data for successful
reconstruction.
  In contrast, we present a method that is able to use the known camera
calibration thereby producing near metric solutions, that is, reconstructions
that are accurate up to a similarity transformation. To achieve this we
introduce pairwise relative rotation estimates that carry information about
camera calibration. These are only invariant to similarity transformations,
thus encouraging solutions that preserve metric features of the real scene. Our
method can be seen as integrating rotation averaging into the pOSE framework
striving towards initialization-free calibrated SfM.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that we are able to reliably optimize our
objective, achieving convergence to the global minimum with high probability
from random starting solutions, resulting in accurate near metric
reconstructions.

Motivation: Existing methods for medical anomaly detection often rely on synthetic data or memory banks, which can be limiting. There's a need for a more effective approach that leverages pre-trained models and improves semantic alignment between visual and textual features.

Method: The paper proposes a dual-branch design in the CLIP vision encoder to capture normal and abnormal features separately using learnable adapters. It also employs learnable text prompts to enhance semantic alignment and introduces SigLIP loss to manage the many-to-one relationship between images and text prompts.

Result: The approach achieves superior performance in both image-level anomaly classification and pixel-level anomaly segmentation across multiple modalities, outperforming existing methods in same-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts CLIP for medical anomaly detection without relying on synthetic data or memory banks, with each component contributing significantly as confirmed by ablation studies.

Abstract: An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging
the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both
image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation

improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual
features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the

its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is
validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over
existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved
remarkable success in zero-shot learning (ZSL) by leveraging large-scale
visual-text pair datasets. However, these methods often lack interpretability,
as they compute the similarity between an entire query image and the embedded
category words, making it difficult to explain their predictions. One approach
to address this issue is to develop interpretable models by integrating
language, where classifiers are built using discrete attributes, similar to
human perception. This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align
local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs.
To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for
interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal
transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated
attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable
similarity without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments

Abstract: Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal

performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding
of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in
significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long
videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world
applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these
issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of
processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.
Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity
context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the
distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to
retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to
existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference
latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video
benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method. Code

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides crucial insights into tissue

alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI)
is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on
single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial
and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g.,
gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among
adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address
these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and
both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model
comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch
and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and
contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure
alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six

Abstract: The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of
multi-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks
was recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal
performance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention
on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying
learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single
matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to
single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results
indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each
label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This
leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,
thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several
distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy
but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields
superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on
hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is
achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer
blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage
learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The
extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks,
based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the
potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated
using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100
dataset.

Conclusion: PointSSIM is a suitable method for image comparison tasks requiring resolution invariance and structural analysis, offering an efficient and reliable solution.

Abstract: This paper presents PointSSIM, a novel low-dimensional image-to-image

structural similarity index measure and mathematical morphology, PointSSIM
enables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by
transforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features
of the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by
identifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform. Image
comparisons are then performed using a summary vector, capturing intensity,
connectivity, complexity, and structural attributes. Results show that this

Abstract: Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera
paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than
individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity
object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation.
Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring
detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we
introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement
framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object
geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting
degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D
understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning
each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting
spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained
enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and
appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency

Abstract: As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into
daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction faces persistent challenges in reconciling
geometric fidelity with photometric consistency under complex scene conditions.
We present HiNeuS, a unified framework that holistically addresses three core
limitations in existing approaches: multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing
keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from over-enforced
Eikonal constraints during joint optimization. To resolve these issues through
a unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification
through SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous
occlusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry
patches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges
through adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal
relaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local
radiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global
regularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential
optimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration
where appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout
training. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, including a 21.4% reduction in
Chamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement
against neural rendering counterparts. Qualitative analyses reveal superior
capability in recovering specular instruments, urban layouts with
centimeter-scale infrastructure, and low-textured surfaces without local patch
collapse. The method's generalizability is further validated through successful
application to inverse rendering tasks, including material decomposition and
view-consistent relighting.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large
Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often
struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better
tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes.
Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static
prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts,
improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work,
we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using
VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even
random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned
counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts
conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT
problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning
(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by
learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be
used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT
schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently
improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with
negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT
with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT
approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art
conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets. Code:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant
bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration,
high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been
proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not
optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video
data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block
Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for
VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within
pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,
varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA
enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a
layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to
diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global
block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions
across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to
dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative
similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly
accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and
1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation
quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance
in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for
high-res video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing 3D reconstruction models due to insufficient or non-diverse training data, enabling better generalization without relying on scene geometry or camera parameters.

Method: Puzzles uses targeted image transformations to simulate various camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry, creating a large amount of synthetic posed video-depth data from one image or video clip.

Result: Experiments show that using Puzzles in 3D reconstruction pipelines improves performance, even with only 10% of the original training data, achieving accuracy similar to full dataset training.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that Puzzles effectively augments data for 3D reconstruction, enhancing model performance without altering the network architecture, and demonstrates the potential of synthetic data in improving real-world applications.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision.
Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps
from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters.
However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and
scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data
augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality
posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse
camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image
transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive
experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D
reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the
underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of
the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to
those trained on the full dataset. Code is available at

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability

frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress,
existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead
models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel
prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge
posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class
prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or
hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and
OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD
detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and
demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as
CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced
Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3%

Abstract: Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains
a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging

prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with
SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total
of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver,
prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were
divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for
testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse,
and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen
datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise
of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence
on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on
code.sonography.ai after acceptance.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly outperforming classical

cohorts remains inadequately assessed. As age and sex are key neurobiological
markers in clinical neuroscience, influencing brain structure and disease risk,
this study evaluates three of the existing three-dimensional architectures,
namely Simple Fully Connected Network (SFCN), DenseNet, and Shifted Window
(Swin) Transformers, for age and sex prediction using T1-weighted MRI from four
independent cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB, n=47,390), Dallas Lifespan Brain Study
(DLBS, n=132), Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n=108 healthy
controls), and Information eXtraction from Images (IXI, n=319). We found that
SFCN consistently outperformed more complex architectures with AUC of 1.00
[1.00-1.00] in UKB (internal test set) and 0.85-0.91 in external test sets for
sex classification. For the age prediction task, SFCN demonstrated a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 2.66 (r=0.89) in UKB and 4.98-5.81 (r=0.55-0.70) across
external datasets. Pairwise DeLong and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Bonferroni corrections confirmed SFCN's superiority over Swin Transformer
across most cohorts (p<0.017, for three comparisons). Explainability analysis
further demonstrates the regional consistency of model attention across cohorts
and specific to each task. Our findings reveal that simpler convolutional
networks outperform the denser and more complex attention-based DL
architectures in brain image analysis by demonstrating better generalizability
across different datasets.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

Abstract: Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have achieved promising progress
by employing lightweight visual adapters to incorporate auxiliary modality
features into frozen foundation models. However, existing approaches often
struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues
across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative
representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but
effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from
auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency,
spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter
inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and
performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent
propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth,
and RGB-Event tracking. Code and models are available at

Abstract: Understanding why a classification model prefers one class over another for
an input instance is the challenge of contrastive explanation. This work
implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by
leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of
human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our
approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for
similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based
on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image
augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation
complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether
explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as
rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept
relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance
results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show
varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights
into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.

Abstract: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving
systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving
(E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned
behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous
vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets
annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the
development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we
present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations
capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for
personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from
real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned
visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario
construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference
annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.
To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the
VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and
driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a
human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building
on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized
E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without
preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized
preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays
the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to
systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,
catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

Abstract: In practice, environments constantly change over time and space, posing
significant challenges for object detectors trained based on a closed-set
assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same distribution. To this
end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to
improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters,
e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images,
fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other
fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new
mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter
generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware
adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional
diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the
adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the
optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a
class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain
adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile,
visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated
parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the
generalization ability.

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across
various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its
extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model
adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,
existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which
overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in
the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that
leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a
multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the
wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA
obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution
analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while
providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.
Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA
performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,
classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated
image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was
primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in
language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction
of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes
remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly
post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or
requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of
vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to
a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all
geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel
Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and
surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D
Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the
mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration
directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities
optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical
contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both
representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying
geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each
training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay
triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D
Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric
erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,
with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh
vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior,
our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics
simulations or animation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a complex understanding
of scenes, benefiting from large-scale and high-quality datasets. Most existing
caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities.
Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed
descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution
images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first
massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design
a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed
object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains
entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level,
detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage.
The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational
dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality,
we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial
Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including
vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video
generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.
However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with
flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.
This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint
distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially
constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose
Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized
spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled
spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from
fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video
prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an
end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration
generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to
address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes
longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model
further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end
planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion generative models significantly advanced
image, video, and 3D content creation from user-provided text prompts. However,
the challenging problem of dynamic 3D content generation (text-to-4D) with
diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
TextMesh4D, a novel framework for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Our
approach leverages per-face Jacobians as a differentiable mesh representation
and decomposes 4D generation into two stages: static object creation and
dynamic motion synthesis. We further propose a flexibility-rigidity
regularization term to stabilize Jacobian optimization under video diffusion
priors, ensuring robust geometric performance. Experiments demonstrate that
TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of temporal consistency,
structural fidelity, and visual realism. Moreover, TextMesh4D operates with a
low GPU memory overhead-requiring only a single 24GB GPU-offering a
cost-effective yet high-quality solution for text-driven 4D mesh generation.
The code will be released to facilitate future research in text-to-4D

Abstract: We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that

for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of
precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our
framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a
self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image
generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically
construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a
localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which
comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from
reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to
directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing
the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's
accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph
positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography,
Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in
digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the
model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging
data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the
concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level
skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information
vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge
through pixel space optimization and existing core local information
identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset
distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level
refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,
achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory
usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual
Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art,
demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple
dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with
ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the
method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and
50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and
outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4%

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have
recently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive
with traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network
training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical
adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the
components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in
terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.
We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a
state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When
all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7
different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared
to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then
tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of
hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle
training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the
weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher
quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at
0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by
0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar
speeds. Our project website is available at https://mgwillia.github.io/vinrb/

Abstract: Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for
robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include
drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural
language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication,
drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the
key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to
which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large
language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and
produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of
granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action
sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our
results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the
production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve
satisfactory performance.

Abstract: Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research
in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the
development of game description languages: frameworks that compile
domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing
researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games
without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in
reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware
acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of
cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by
orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research:
a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into
hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of
game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing
hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines.
We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from
RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible
representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description
language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed
benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework,
along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely

Motivation: Modern explainable machine learning methods often lack consideration of practical usage, leading to potential misuses due to ambiguity. The paper aims to address this by focusing on specific end-use cases.

Method: The paper proposes a framework based on statistical decision theory to formalize the intended use of explanations, allowing for their evaluation in diverse scenarios.

Result: The approach enables characterization of the maximum performance boost explanations can provide for an idealized decision-maker and helps prevent misuse by requiring concrete use cases to be specified.

Conclusion: Evaluation of explanations should integrate both theoretical and empirical perspectives, and the paper provides definitions that bridge these viewpoints.

Abstract: Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how
models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these
explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations
should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how
to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We
show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use
cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We
demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a
particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker,
preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete
use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use.
We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on
the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these
perspectives.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges
posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into
society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and
their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial
risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The
complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead
to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or
understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and
guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools
aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view
of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness.
Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such
quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific
aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method
that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic
processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment
framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment
techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The
application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI
system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights
while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a
significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models,
particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction

transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source

develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning
traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are
filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria
selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a
hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and
tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter
architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a
test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning
capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks,
significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the
enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its
performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes
effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures,

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing
inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive
biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation
pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and
limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE
architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU
expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a
sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG
News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely
trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input
representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert
aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch
sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed
computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize
more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the
source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning
tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional
computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in
low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled
specialization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning

first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by
critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the
prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when
faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to
constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical
reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning
demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of
well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

Abstract: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason
through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial
intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only
reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly
retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning
remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a
challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize
multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason
step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is
composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the
crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and
physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --
all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%
accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the
random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for
existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where
MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By
shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the
development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and
plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that AURA is the first open-source speech-native assistant capable of completing complex, goal-driven tasks through dynamic tool invocation and multi-turn conversation, demonstrating high performance and effectiveness in benchmark evaluations.

Abstract: Despite advances in language and speech technologies, no open-source system
enables full speech-to-speech, multi-turn dialogue with integrated tool use and
agentic reasoning. We introduce AURA (Agent for Understanding, Reasoning, and
Automated Tool Use), the first open-source, speech-native assistant capable of
completing complex, goal-driven tasks through dynamic tool invocation and
multi-turn conversation. AURA combines open-weight ASR, TTS, and LLMs in a
cascaded pipeline and supports tools such as calendar booking, contact lookup,
web search, and email. Its modular design allows easy integration of new tools
using natural language prompts and action classes. On VoiceBench, AURA scores
92.75% on OpenBookQA-outperforming all open-weight systems and nearing
GPT-4o-and 4.39 on AlpacaEval, competitive with other open-weight systems.
Human evaluation shows 90% task success on complex, multi-turn speech tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive five-stage evolutionary framework for
understanding the development of artificial intelligence, arguing that its
trajectory mirrors the historical progression of human cognitive technologies.
We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a
revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous
to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical
calculus, and formal logical systems. This "Geometry of Cognition" framework
moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model
that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to
Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward.
Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but
reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it
develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying
architecture. We are currently transitioning into a "Metalinguistic Moment,"
characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like
Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the
"Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment," will be
defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through
neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably
aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations.
This work serves as the methodological capstone to our trilogy, which
previously explored the economic drivers ("why") and cognitive nature ("what")
of AI. Here, we address the "how," providing a theoretical foundation for
future research and offering concrete, actionable strategies for startups and
developers aiming to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

### [235] [Can Large Language Models Capture Human Risk Preferences? A Cross-Cultural Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23107)
*Bing Song,Jianing Liu,Sisi Jian,Chenyang Wu,Vinayak Dixit*

TL;DR: This study compares LLMs' risky decision-making with human behavior, finding they are more risk-averse, with o1-mini performing closer to humans, and Chinese predictions diverging more than English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about LLMs' reliability in simulating complex decision-making, especially risky choices that lead to multiple outcomes.

Method: Comparing model-generated decisions with human responses in lottery tasks using transportation survey data from four cities, analyzing risk preferences via CRRA framework.

Result: Both LLMs show more risk-averse behavior than humans; o1-mini is closer to human decisions. Chinese model predictions deviate more from actual responses than English.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential in simulating risk behavior but face limitations in linguistic and cultural contexts, needing improvement for accurate human-like decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, extending their
applications to dialogue systems, automated content creation, and
domain-specific advisory tasks. However, as their use grows, concerns have
emerged regarding their reliability in simulating complex decision-making
behavior, such as risky decision-making, where a single choice can lead to
multiple outcomes. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate
risky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with
actual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation
stated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong,
and Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and
ChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk
preferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA)
framework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than
human participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human
decisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong
indicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses
compared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation
performance. These findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, particularly in
linguistic and cultural settings.

Result: The result is a deeper understanding of societal impacts and the development of a research-policy interface for improved AI governance.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that building scientific foundations and connecting research with policy can lead to better societal outcomes in the AI age.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is humanity's most promising technology because of
the remarkable capabilities offered by foundation models. Yet, the same
technology brings confusion and consternation: foundation models are poorly
understood and they may precipitate a wide array of harms. This dissertation
explains how technology and society coevolve in the age of AI, organized around
three themes. First, the conceptual framing: the capabilities, risks, and the
supply chain that grounds foundation models in the broader economy. Second, the
empirical insights that enrich the conceptual foundations: transparency created
via evaluations at the model level and indexes at the organization level.
Finally, the transition from understanding to action: superior understanding of
the societal impact of foundation models advances evidence-based AI policy.
View together, this dissertation makes inroads into achieving better societal
outcomes in the age of AI by building the scientific foundations and
research-policy interface required for better AI governance.

Abstract: How far are Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing deep relational
reasoning? In this paper, we evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of
three cutting-edge LLMs, namely, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o, through a
suite of carefully designed benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph
reasoning. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the
highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong
aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all evaluated
models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggle significantly as problem complexity
increases, largely due to token length limitations and incomplete output
structures. A detailed analysis of DeepSeek-R1's long Chain-of-Thought
responses uncovers its unique planning and verification strategies, but also
highlights instances of incoherent or incomplete reasoning, calling attention
to the need for deeper scrutiny into LLMs' internal inference dynamics. We
further discuss key directions for future work, including the role of
multimodal reasoning and the systematic examination of reasoning failures. Our
findings provide both empirical insights and theoretical implications for
advancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks that demand
structured, multi-step logical inference. Our code repository will be publicly

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge
Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However,
traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge
graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or
over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring
edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational
message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a
\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this
strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its
incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most
pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is
effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a
\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused
node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and
features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures
and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link
prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a standardized measure for distributivity in concept lattices used in data analysis, particularly in Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), as none currently exists.

Method: Introduce the concept of 'rises' in (concept) lattices, which quantify changes in attributes or objects within covering concepts. Use these to characterize distributive lattices and relate them to meet- and join distributivity.

Result: A lattice is distributive if and only if there are no non-unit rises. Real-world concept lattices show high join-distributivity but lower meet-distributivity. Join-distributivity is also studied on the level of ordered sets.

Conclusion: The notion of rises provides a new way to assess distributivity in concept lattices, highlighting that real-world data often leads to lattices with more join-distributive properties than meet-distributive ones.

Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in
lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal
Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of
distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this
property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices
as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes
or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that
a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore,
we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We
observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree
join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how
join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming
increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and
collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,
robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of
costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide
whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize
defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional
choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs
navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four
distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and
sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and
disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and
others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we
find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with
cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of
cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving
LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not
necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM
agents in environments that require sustained collaboration. Our code is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based
systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral
diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in
large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create
agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning
mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel
framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich
behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional
approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual
lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions
through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and
lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1)
a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with
agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully
functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation
demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors.
Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can
transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling
realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for
activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility
contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with
human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic
traffic evolution patterns. The code for the prototype system is shared at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems are increasingly deployed
in real world applications, yet they remain ethically opaque-often producing
overconfident answers to ambiguous questions or failing to communicate
uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. This misalignment between model confidence
and actual knowledge poses significant risks, particularly in domains requiring
ethical accountability. Existing approaches such as LayoutLMv3, UDOP, and DONUT
have advanced SOTA performance by focusing on architectural sophistication and
accuracy; however, they fall short in ethical responsiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce HonestVQA, a self-supervised
honesty calibration framework for ethically aligned DocVQA. Our model-agnostic
method quantifies uncertainty to identify knowledge gaps, aligns model
confidence with actual correctness using weighted loss functions, and enforces
ethical response behavior via contrastive learning. We further introduce two
principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence
Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical
communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3%
and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces
overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In
cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score,
demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy
without alignment or contrastive loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap in methodologies for analyzing cognitive pathways in social media data, enabling psychotherapists to provide timely interventions for mental health disorders.

Method: The method involves using BERT and RoBERTa for sentiment analysis, T5 and PEGASUS for text summarization, and mT5 for multilingual text translation to detect negative emotions and cognitive distortions.

Result: The system can categorize textual and visual content as positive or negative, detect negative emotions and cognitive distortions, and predict additional negative side effects and mental health disorders like phobias and eating disorders.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a comprehensive tool for psychotherapists to identify and address psychological issues early through social media analysis.

Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a proven approach for addressing the
irrational thought patterns associated with mental health disorders, but its
effectiveness relies on accurately identifying cognitive pathways to provide
targeted treatment. In today's digital age, individuals often express negative
emotions on social media, where they may reveal cognitive distortions, and in
severe cases, exhibit suicidal tendencies. However, there is a significant gap
in methodologies designed to analyze these cognitive pathways, which could be
critical for psychotherapists aiming to deliver timely and effective
interventions in online environments. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
framework leveraging acceptance, commitment and data augmentation to categorize
and address both textual and visual content as positive or negative.
Specifically, the system employs BERT, RoBERTa for Sentiment Analysis and T5,
PEGASUS for Text Summarization, mT5 for Text Translation in Multiple Languages
focusing on detecting negative emotions and cognitive distortions within social
media data. While existing models are primarily designed to identify negative
thoughts, the proposed system goes beyond this by predicting additional
negative side effects and other potential mental health disorders likes
Phobias, Eating Disorders. This enhancement allows for a more comprehensive
understanding and intervention strategy, offering psychotherapists a powerful
tool for early detection and treatment of various psychological issues.

Abstract: The recent development of advanced machine learning methods for hybrid models
has greatly addressed the need for the correct prediction of electrical prices.
This method combines AlexNet and LSTM algorithms, which are used to introduce a
new model with higher accuracy in price forecasting. Despite RNN and ANN being
effective, they often fail to deal with forex time sequence data. The
traditional methods do not accurately forecast the prices. These traditional
methods only focus on demand and price which leads to insufficient analysis of
data. To address this issue, using the hybrid approach, which focuses on
external variables that also effect the predicted prices. Nevertheless, due to
AlexNet's excellent feature extraction and LSTM's learning sequential patterns,
the prediction accuracy is vastly increased. The model is built on the past
data, which has been supplied with the most significant elements like demand,
temperature, sunlight, and rain. For example, the model applies methods, such
as minimum-maximum scaling and a time window, to predict the electricity prices
of the future. The results show that this hybrid model is good than the
standalone ones in terms of accuracy. Although we got our accuracy rating of
97.08, it shows higher accompaniments than remaining models RNN and ANN with
accuracies of 96.64 and 96.63 respectively.

Abstract: As the use of AI tools by students has become more prevalent, instructors

our study, we focused mostly on the success rate of GPTZero, the most-used AI
detector, in identifying AI-generated texts based on different lengths of
randomly submitted essays: short (40-100 word count), medium (100-350 word
count), and long (350-800 word count). We gathered a data set consisting of
twenty-eight AI-generated papers and fifty human-written papers. With this
randomized essay data, papers were individually plugged into GPTZero and
measured for percentage of AI generation and confidence. A vast majority of the
AI-generated papers were detected accurately (ranging from 91-100% AI believed
generation), while the human generated essays fluctuated; there were a handful
of false positives. These findings suggest that although GPTZero is effective
at detecting purely AI-generated content, its reliability in distinguishing
human-authored texts is limited. Educators should therefore exercise caution
when relying solely on AI detection tools.

Abstract: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic

critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity
of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for
developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present
ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical
executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured
action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to
address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This
framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on
distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate
machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we
introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the
model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive
experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A)
tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%. The code

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain
environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize
poorly to unseen partners or require extensive training. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context
coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to
unseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to
increase the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on
adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed
partner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from
diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns
effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning.
Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly
outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen
partners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective
collaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness,
flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM
benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating
long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty
and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)
inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we
introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively
evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,
challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring
multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple
difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from
foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated
into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to
eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust
reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed
step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism
to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark
popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning
capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing
MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at

Motivation: Recent advances in LLMs have led to concerns about jailbreaking attacks, which bypass safety mechanisms. Current automated defences have limitations, so there's a need for more robust alignment solutions.

Method: We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies (AutoDefense, BetterDan, JB) and compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent configurations by reproducing the AutoDefense framework.

Result: Multi-agent systems enhance resistance to jailbreaks, particularly reducing false negatives, but effectiveness varies by attack type and they introduce trade-offs like increased false positives and computational overhead.

Conclusion: The findings highlight limitations of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment robustness in future LLM systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated method for tuning RL agent reward functions using a language model, based on user-defined behavioral goals. The approach iteratively refines weights without manual engineering, showing significant performance improvements in a racing task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of designing effective reward functions in RL for games, which usually requires expert knowledge and becomes suboptimal when game content or mechanics change.

Method: The method involves using a language model to propose updated reward function weights iteratively. The LM receives a user-defined behavioral goal and performance statistics from previous training rounds to adjust the weights.

Result: The approach was evaluated in a racing task, showing consistent performance improvement across iterations. LM-guided agents increased success rates from 9% to 74% in one iteration, achieving 80% by the final iteration with 855 average time steps, comparable to human expert tuning.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that LM-guided iterative reward function tuning is effective, enabling agents to adapt to game changes without manual intervention and achieving competitive performance against expert-tuned agents.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in
recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can
transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in
production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective
reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content
or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be
optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for
iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a
user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes
updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary
of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process
allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing
increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering.
We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently
improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a
significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just
one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual
weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent
achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time
steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$
success, and $850$ time steps.

Abstract: Domain shift is a critical problem for pathology AI as pathology data is
heavily influenced by center-specific conditions. Current pathology domain
adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to
capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this
work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a
Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD
achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient
slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical
adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for
feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to
preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency
Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype
selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method
on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC
improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in
a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable
slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing
both computational and annotation costs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model
(LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon
Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and
Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent
functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game.
These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out
within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates
the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once
verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a
closed-loop decision-making system.
  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution
Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of
80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an
experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle
performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related
tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic
reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM
exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct
strategic behaviors.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering
increasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety
assurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of
safety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a
new level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While
data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control
systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety.
Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an
interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and
the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system
analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to
as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing
safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm
of data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety
analysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for
specific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.

Motivation: To address the lack of verifiable results and confidentiality issues in existing AI benchmarks, especially when there's no trust between the model provider and auditor.

Method: Using Trusted Execution Environments to run audits, allowing verification of interactions with AI models without exposing sensitive data or model IP.

Result: A prototype was developed that shows the feasibility of Attestable Audits on standard audit benchmarks against Llama-3.1.

Conclusion: Attestable Audits provide a secure and verifiable method for evaluating AI model compliance, enhancing trust in AI governance frameworks.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important measures to evaluate safety and compliance of AI
models at scale. However, they typically do not offer verifiable results and
lack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable
Audits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to
verify interaction with a compliant AI model. Our work protects sensitive data
even when model provider and auditor do not trust each other. This addresses
verification challenges raised in recent AI governance frameworks. We build a
prototype demonstrating feasibility on typical audit benchmarks against
Llama-3.1.

Abstract: Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by
repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are
rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word
equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably
on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving
process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word
equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts,
enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable
number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to
the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done
with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The
experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers,
the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable
appears at most once in each equation.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot
trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously
move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to
be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world
applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized
suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage.
Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation
learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively
fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging
a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training
while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF
solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across
many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving
up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for
scalability in MAPF domains.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of
autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic,
open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from
static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these
capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also
introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool
misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the
threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we
first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin
increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,
modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze
the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying
failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and
deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.
These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across
perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,
we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different
autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,
constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective
reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a
unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes
(CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation,
and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety
across the agent's decision-making loop.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve AI systems' ability to perform sound deductive reasoning, which is crucial for artificial general intelligence.

Method: The method involves critiquing current statistical learning approaches and proposing a shift towards exact learning paradigms.

Result: The result is the identification of the root cause of AI systems' failures in deductive reasoning and the proposal of a new approach.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that exact learning is essential and achievable for developing reliable deductive reasoning in AI systems.

Abstract: Sound deductive reasoning -- the ability to derive new knowledge from
existing facts and rules -- is an indisputably desirable aspect of general
intelligence. Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math
and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it
is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and
consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these
systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general
intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound
behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their
development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive
reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift
from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning
problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning
paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning
is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide
algorithm design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across
various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations
Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived
from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored.
In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve
stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by
uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and
stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of
graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs'
abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of
simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to
make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a
nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic
modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on
par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings
highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and
amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.

Abstract: Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental
functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management
and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly
challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience
(for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep
learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction
of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network
topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in
real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial
brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework
integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic
reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of
global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure
of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying
assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but
also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning.
Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms
resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up
to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension
reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains
robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest
that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and
planning for industrial chain.

Abstract: In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest
as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement
Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement
and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing
benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision
algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we
have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we
established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of
non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence
relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel
perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further
introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the
History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the
state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our
analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad
range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and
flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings
where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can
develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable
rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and
domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework
where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously
improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.
Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively
challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To
enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,
multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose
role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.
Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that
transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%
improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000
expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through
three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,
and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple
Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct
reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model
(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These
results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable
reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous
reasoning development.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can
perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or
translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with
objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other
language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,
concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to
which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.
Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,
conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands
of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human
ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover
many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we
evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on
two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets
cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that
alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated
(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and
gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,
olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation
of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which
may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and
illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this
framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI,
TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for
accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each
responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual
correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs
are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream
analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with
human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system
approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information
consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing
average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement
rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of
industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need
for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of
large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and
scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise
context.

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions
through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a
vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.
However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in
practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of
ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify
responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized
database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and
utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of
multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,
hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through
experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,
and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.
The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct
responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language
models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a
scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models
to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the
garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on
training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for
nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and
difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly
restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention
as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data
poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that
prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an
innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically
significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and
emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data
augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity
scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.
The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:
Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and
Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting
data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,
interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and
social science methodology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle
cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks
underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard
individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements
that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.
To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale
language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains
challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,
we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context
Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform
supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the
workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we
apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal
adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.
Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both
anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight
design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and
communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to
integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target
domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is
ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and
recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm
to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,
unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of
graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional
contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,
which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From
experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific
differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from
different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,
namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning
strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and
introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the
downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable
fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\%
on Macro-F1 score.

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for
explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise
elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the
latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model
(LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind
(ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the
differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM
representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT
3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure
(IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations
independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to
differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent
separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive
experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic
spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary
Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators
of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under
$\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses. The Appendix and code are available

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from
up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs
often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground
truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often
introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph
data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To
mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak
retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM
feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the
supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module
to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.
Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and
consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.
The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art
performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.
Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token
cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

Abstract: Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized,

misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this
paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based
graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages
from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both
weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to
fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual
annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only
models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as
a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation
significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,
view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and
highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.
This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future
research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and
other low-moderation social platforms.

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for
performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition,
there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the
research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that
research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such
systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.
RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment
implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not
previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing
research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.
RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation
infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success
criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented
using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find
that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the
extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written
hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This
indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic
research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

Conclusion: The research provides a novel methodology for detecting synthetic text to promote ethical AI text generation.

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing
their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society.
While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple
concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have
sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of
markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic
identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel
methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of
ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The
investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline
study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying
generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach
and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to
asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our
proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

Abstract: We present our submission to the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, which evaluates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the

with Falcon3-10B-Instruct. Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic
questions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user
combinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP
from 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive
computational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting
strategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%
refusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our
submitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness
and 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question
categories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents
was the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with
document-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762.

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) in detecting

collected during simulated space missions. Specifically, we examine zero-shot
classification, fine-tuning, and paraphrase-augmented fine-tuning with
encoder-only sequence classification LLMs, as well as few-shot text generation
with decoder-only causal language modeling LLMs, to predict the micro-behavior
associated with each conversational turn (i.e., dialogue). Our findings
indicate that encoder-only LLMs, such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT, struggled to
detect underrepresented micro-behaviors, particularly discouraging speech, even
with weighted fine-tuning. In contrast, the instruction fine-tuned version of
Llama-3.1, a decoder-only LLM, demonstrated superior performance, with the best
models achieving macro F1-scores of 44% for 3-way classification and 68% for
binary classification. These results have implications for the development of
speech technologies aimed at analyzing team communication dynamics and
enhancing training interventions in high-stakes environments such as space
missions, particularly in scenarios where text is the only accessible data.

TL;DR: The paper presents VocabTrim, a training-free technique that improves speculative decoding by limiting the drafter's vocabulary to frequently used tokens, enhancing speed on memory-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding using draft models may have unnecessary inference overhead due to vocabulary mismatches, especially with large target models.

Method: VocabTrim reduces the drafter's LM head to a subset of frequently sampled tokens from the target model's vocabulary, lowering drafting latency without training.

Result: VocabTrim increased memory-bound speed-up by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on Spec-Bench, despite a slight drop in acceptance rate.

Conclusion: VocabTrim effectively improves generation speed in memory-bound scenarios by optimizing drafter vocabulary, making speculative decoding more efficient on edge devices.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

(NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to
address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship
between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension
and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,
and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying
processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both
inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The
workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language
models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of
LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language
understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to
offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between
LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with
human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI
collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report
aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in
cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance
of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving
to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through

<details>

Motivation: To address the poor quality of multilingual generation in LLMs for mid- to low-resource languages.

Method: Using logit lens to analyze model processing in intermediate layers for a word translation task across 108 language pairs.

Result: A significant portion of generation failures stem from translation errors, particularly in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The translation barrier is a major obstacle for end-to-end multilingual generation, suggesting areas for future improvement in LLMs.

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor
quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from
interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit
task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first
solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and
subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We
hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit
for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the
translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation
task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in
intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures
indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate
correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is
especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an
important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding
insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting
unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their
chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for
high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL
intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are
influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a
Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently
train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which
incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack
by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models
exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained
model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we
perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;
with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT
achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the
influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while
baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching
models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly
improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and
safe AI systems.

TL;DR: ContextCache is a context-aware semantic caching system that improves multi-turn dialogue efficiency by using a two-stage retrieval architecture with vector-based and self-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing semantic caching systems that do not consider multi-turn dialogue contexts, leading to incorrect cache hits.

Method: A two-stage retrieval architecture: first vector-based retrieval on the current query, then self-attention to integrate current and historical dialogue representations.

Result: ContextCache improves precision and recall in real-world conversations and reduces latency by about 10 times compared to direct LLM invocation.

Conclusion: ContextCache enables significant computational cost reductions for LLM conversational applications by effectively handling multi-turn contexts.

Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves
efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses.
However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries,
lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect
cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings.
This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching
system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval
architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to
identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue
representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual
matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache
improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,
cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM
invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM
conversational applications.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of comprehensive evaluation for medical ethics in Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs), as their ethical safety hasn't been sufficiently explored.

Method: The method involves creating a benchmark called MedEthicsQA with multiple-choice and open-ended questions, establishing a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical ethical standards, and applying multi-stage filtering and expert validation to ensure data quality.

Result: The result shows that state-of-the-art MedLLMs perform worse than foundation models on medical ethics questions, indicating deficiencies in their ethical alignment.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that there is a need for improved medical ethics alignment in MedLLMs, and the MedEthicsQA benchmark provides a reliable tool for evaluating and addressing these ethical shortcomings.

Abstract: While Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in clinical tasks, their ethical safety remains insufficiently
explored. This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising $\textbf{5,623}$ multiple-choice questions and
$\textbf{5,351}$ open-ended questions for evaluation of medical ethics in LLMs.
We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical
ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets,
authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature.
Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted
expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate
($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance
in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation
counterparts, elucidating the deficiencies of medical ethics alignment. The

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models
(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training
domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified
model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and
scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling
trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which
dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,
for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing
domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)
performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to
create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically
merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across
various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or
removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which
outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights
into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our
framework.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have
revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural
network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art
performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference
speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,
CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to
model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we
propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate
Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large
language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder
layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a
causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances
linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC
decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we
demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the
LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance
for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.
Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs
with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly
implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved
knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge
effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do
such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to
finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific
data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called
knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2
dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive
knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT
techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show
that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in existing function-calling benchmarks that focus on single-turn interactions but overlook real-world complexity.

Method: The method involves creating DICE-SCORE to measure tool information dispersion and DICE-BENCH with a tool graph and multi-agent system to generate realistic datasets.

Result: The analysis shows existing benchmarks have low DICE-SCORE, and the new dataset has 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Experiments on 19 LLMs indicate need for more advances.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that current LLMs require significant improvements to handle real-world function-calling scenarios effectively.

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions.
However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how
existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a
metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as
function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing
benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need
for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a
framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing
conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds
and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue
naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our
experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still
required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a training approach for ASR systems that uses overlapping context windows to improve named entity recognition and formatting, resulting in better performance on semantic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems like Whisper have high transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data, leading to higher WER and reduced semantic understanding in critical domains.

Method: The method involves extending the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping 5-second windows on both sides of 30-second chunks, creating a 40-second effective window. Entities spanning chunk boundaries are reassigned to the right-hand chunk, and training data is enriched with embedded entity labels.

Result: Evaluated on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, the method improves performance in semantic tasks such as NER and entity formatting.

Conclusion: The results show that context-aware training is effective in addressing ASR limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high
transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data,
especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error
rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal,
financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that
extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context
windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of
30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving
entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30
seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such
entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting.
Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the
model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the
Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic
tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These
results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR
limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent
and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and
conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and
robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness
which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and
constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify
and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this
paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and
present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.
We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,
linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably
identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT
and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case
studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration
through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety
vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak
susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of
identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further
understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent
deployments. Our code is open-sourced at

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How
Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which
investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual
recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully
reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and
counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism
competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing
information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three
significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these
findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B
(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head
specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by
introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement
verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the
logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the
authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain
categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction
token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the
attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for
domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness
varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by
perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions.
However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based
scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We
propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in
embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on
rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,
covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework
supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides
multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person
perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person
evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records
after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for
a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the
subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We
constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective
videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated
multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically
evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform
significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between
humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person
evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM
capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

Motivation: NER is crucial for analyzing historical texts in digital humanities, but Brazilian Portuguese lacks high-quality datasets, especially for specific domains.

Method: Constructing MariNER by manually annotating over 9,000 sentences from historical texts.

Result: MariNER is developed as the first gold-standard dataset for this domain, and SOTA NER models are assessed and compared.

Conclusion: The creation of MariNER addresses the scarcity of NER resources for Brazilian Portuguese, enabling better analysis of historical texts in digital humanities.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that aims to identify and classify entity mentions in texts across
different categories. While languages such as English possess a large number of
high-quality resources for this task, Brazilian Portuguese still lacks in
quantity of gold-standard NER datasets, especially when considering specific

historical texts in the context of digital humanities. To address this gap,
this work outlines the construction of MariNER: \textit{Mapeamento e

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from
various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental
analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency
in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter
substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that
these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical
knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework
for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search
for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external
molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the
chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized
molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,
addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly
gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between Text-to-SQL's limitations with unstructured data and vector search's potential, creating a more versatile database interface.

Method: Building a vector index on relevant columns, extending queries with semantic search, and creating models with synthetic data.

Result: Significant performance improvements over baseline methods in handling diverse queries.

Conclusion: Text2VectorSQL provides a foundation for better database interfaces by combining semantic retrieval with traditional SQL.

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured
databases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous
queries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector
search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly
for unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely
heavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a
significant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To
bridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel
framework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness
constraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.
Specifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,
and retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on
appropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate
ground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we
develop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work
establishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more
versatile and intuitive database interfaces. The repository will be publicly

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing
concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias,
particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks
predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may
emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going
beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of
relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We
introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs
through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres
assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation
task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias
evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and
closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are
not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the
importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,
interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for
future bias mitigation.

Abstract: Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them

we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to
evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse
castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to
curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,
where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we
generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe
LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:
plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on
these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,
with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find
that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize
their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and
representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities,
calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release
INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and
mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

Abstract: This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -
Hero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test
sets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an
annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more
balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of
the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses
highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real
memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits
explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,
we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual
transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,
and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot
settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like
DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent
challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across
cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to
guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured
instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.
Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt
engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in
visual-textual content.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning
scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action
generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on
static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between
actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable
environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven
reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive
capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our
framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we
employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating
in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven
sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient
learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied
planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates
of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a
large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works show that multiple reasoning formats improve LLMs' performance, but they rely on human-labeled formats which are costly and not suitable for all tasks. The paper aims to adapt formats to tasks automatically.

Method: The paper introduces a method to measure reasoning errors when generating multiple answers and presents Format-Adapter, which uses LLMs to generate and select formats that minimize this error.

Result: Format-Adapter achieves a 4.3% average performance improvement over previous methods on math and commonsense reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: By automatically generating and selecting reasoning formats, Format-Adapter effectively reduces reasoning inconsistencies in LLMs, showing promise for broader applications.

Abstract: Generating and voting multiple answers is an effective method to mitigate
reasoning inconsistencies of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have
shown that multiple reasoning formats outperform a single format when
generating multiple answers. However, previous works using multiple formats
rely on formats labeled by humans, which could be unsuitable for all tasks and
have high labeling costs. To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to
the given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to
measure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we
introduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable
reasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present. We conduct
experiments on math and commonsense reasoning tasks, where Format-Adapter
achieves a 4.3% performance improvement on average over previous works,

and must be repeated with every data update. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) offers an efficient solution by allowing LLMs to access external
knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG pipelines struggle with retrieving
information from complex technical documents with structured data such as
tables and images. In this work, we propose a RAG pipeline, capable of handling
tables and images in documents, for technical documents that support both
scanned and searchable formats. Its retrieval process combines vector
similarity search with a fine-tuned reranker based on Gemma-2-9b-it. The
reranker is trained using RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning) on a custom
dataset designed to improve context identification for question answering. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline achieves a high faithfulness
score of 94% (RAGas) and 96% (DeepEval), and an answer relevancy score of 87%
(RAGas) and 93% (DeepEval). Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed
architecture is superior to general RAG pipelines in terms of table-based
questions and handling questions outside context.

*Siyuan Li,Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) for better knowledge graph completion by combining context-aware static embeddings with dynamic flow-matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGC methods use static embeddings which can't capture contextual dependencies and relational dynamics.

Method: FMS has a semantic context module and a conditional flow-matching module to model relational paths dynamically.

Result: FMS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: FMS improves relational semantics modeling by integrating static and dynamic components.

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on
static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing
contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we
propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal
components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes
context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching
module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail
embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive
vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to
dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this
synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic
information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics.
Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and
complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires
source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources.
These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs,
which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build
it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across
product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected
content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed
ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and
unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our
experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an
average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we
highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to
conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they
often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance
degradation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies
significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to
determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation
approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low
reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient
scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that
quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss
decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input
relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it
captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving
reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual
alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output
calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance
on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings
and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.
Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model
capabilities critical to ICL success.

TL;DR: This paper introduces V-Synthesis, a method for generating consistent and diverse demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL) without relying on pre-existing labels, using a novel consistency metric called V-Score that outperforms traditional metrics like n-grams or embedding vectors.


<details>

Motivation: High labeling cost for in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations motivates using large language models (LLMs) for synthesis to reduce overhead. However, existing methods are task-specific or depend on pre-existing demonstrations.

Method: The paper proposes V-Score as a consistency metric and V-Synthesis, which uses V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure high consistency and diversity in synthesized demonstrations.

Result: Experimental results show that V-Synthesis improves average performance by 2.0% compared to existing synthesis methods.

Conclusion: The study confirms the effectiveness of V-Synthesis in generating high-quality demonstrations for arbitrary tasks without labeling guidance.

Abstract: High labeling cost for in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations motivates
using large language models (LLMs) for synthesis to reduce overhead. However,
existing synthesis methods are mainly task-specific or rely on pre-existing
demonstrations. So this paper focuses on synthesizing demonstrations from
scratch for arbitrary tasks. A major challenge in synthesizing from scratch is
ensuring consistency with the target task, as the lack of labeling guidance
could lead to synthesis bias. We first propose a consistency metric called
V-Score, which has higher performance and lower computation cost compared with
the metrics based on grams or embedding vectors. Furthermore, we introduce
V-Synthesis, which leverages V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure both
high consistency and diversity of synthesized demonstrations. Experimental
results demonstrate that V-Synthesis yields an average performance improvement
of 2.0% compared to existing synthesis methods confirming the effectiveness of
V-Synthesis.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Word embeddings have become essential components in various information
retrieval and natural language processing tasks, such as ranking, document
classification, and question answering. However, despite their widespread use,
traditional word embedding models present a limitation in their static nature,
which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language
patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new
hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding
algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations
in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.
  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating
incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for
the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work
with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media.
The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as
Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized
framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network
training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static
word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to
a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different
hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work
explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a
rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful
generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via
standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a
heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through
offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly
elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised
fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that
subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a
policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our
best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory,
demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge
approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These
findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled
method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training,
heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment
as well as multi-modal models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of spelling normalization in historical documents using two new approaches based on large language models, one unsupervised and one for machine translation. Evaluation across multiple datasets suggests that statistical machine translation remains more suitable for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized spelling in historical documents poses a challenge for humanities scholars, necessitating efforts to align orthography with modern standards.

Method: Proposed two approaches using large language models: one trained without supervised learning and another trained for machine translation.

Result: Both approaches showed promising results, but statistical machine translation was found to be more suitable for spelling normalization.

Conclusion: Statistical machine translation remains the most suitable technology for spelling normalization in historical documents despite the new approaches.

Abstract: The absence of standardized spelling conventions and the organic evolution of
human language present an inherent linguistic challenge within historical
documents, a longstanding concern for scholars in the humanities. Addressing
this issue, spelling normalization endeavors to align a document's orthography
with contemporary standards. In this study, we propose two new approaches based
on large language models: one of which has been trained without a supervised
training, and a second one which has been trained for machine translation. Our
evaluation spans multiple datasets encompassing diverse languages and
historical periods, leading us to the conclusion that while both of them
yielded encouraging results, statistical machine translation still seems to be
the most suitable technology for this task.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based
on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical
Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic
tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or
supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences
as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind
co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an
emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into
long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter
natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with
coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.
Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints
dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in
alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form
of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to
generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We
demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds
distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These
emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value
mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture
provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can
emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building
scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and
reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This
approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative
language models.

Abstract: Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from
health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the
clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural
language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records
(EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized
Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of
this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical
notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with
pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and
MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED
training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish
medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions.
These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were
integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental
results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve
strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%,
respectively.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive progress in multilingual
translation, yet they continue to face challenges with certain language
pairs-particularly those with limited training data or significant linguistic
divergence from English. This study systematically investigates how training
data, language proximity, and language family affect information loss in
multilingual translation. We evaluate two large language models, GPT-4 and
Llama 2, by performing round-trip translations. Translation quality was
assessed using BLEU scores and BERT similarity metrics. Our results reveal a
robust interaction between training data size and language distance: while
abundant training data can mitigate the effects of linguistic divergence,
languages structurally closer to English consistently yield higher translation
quality in low-resource conditions. Among various distance metrics,
orthographic, phylogenetic, syntactic, and geographical distances emerge as
strong predictors of translation performance. Language family also exerts an
independent influence. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the linguistic constraints shaping multilingual translation in large language
models, emphasizing that translation quality is shaped not only by data volume
but also by structural and typological relationships between languages.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the
annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However,
despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in
recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we
introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that
bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of
state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered
annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation
agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs
deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises.
Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and
benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present
evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings
and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort
of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation
agents. The code of the framework is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles.
Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable
understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired
by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or
viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM)
output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space,
dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different
perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt
Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output
perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The
empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled
understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting
outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection,
tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and
tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

Motivation: The motivation is to generate Wikipedia articles autonomously with accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured information from diverse sources, addressing challenges in alignment, informativeness, verifiability, and minimizing hallucinations.

Method: MOG uses a hierarchical memory architecture to extract and recursively organize fine-grained memory units into a Wikipedia-style structure, guiding generation and linking every sentence to specific memory units for traceability.

Result: Evaluations on the WikiStart dataset show MOG outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles, especially in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: MOG is a robust framework for generating autonomous Wikipedia articles by ensuring memory alignment with the article structure, improving reliability and reducing hallucinations through structured information and citations.

Abstract: Generating Wikipedia articles autonomously is a challenging task requiring
the integration of accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured information

Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by
leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory
units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style
hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation
process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline,
improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing
hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance
traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.
Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG
outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles,
making it particularly robust in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models'
(LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and
systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still
lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that
fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original
pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,
providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a
simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We
introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned
LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we
find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling
the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding
and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the
ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training
component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs
circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is
consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those
where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on
model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo
enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and
safety, and vice versa.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pipelined decoder for autoregressive models that enables parallel text generation, improving speed without sacrificing quality or using more memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models generate tokens sequentially, which is slow despite producing high-quality results. There is a need for faster generation methods that maintain quality and efficiency.

Method: The pipelined decoder generates multiple text subsequences in parallel at each time-step, allowing simultaneous token generation for each subsequence rather than sequentially.

Result: Experiments showed that the pipelined decoder significantly improves generation speed across tasks like question answering, summarization, and keyphrase generation, with no major quality loss and no extra memory use.

Conclusion: The pipelined decoder is an efficient solution for parallel text generation in autoregressive models, enhancing speed while preserving quality and resource efficiency.

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the
generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens,
which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one
by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we
propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel
for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates
the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step,
it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism.
Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering,
text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder
significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of
generation quality or additional memory consumption.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATF, a framework that helps large language models handle large tables by filtering out unnecessary data, improving performance on some tasks but slightly reducing it on others that need full context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of large language models in handling large tables due to input length constraints, aiming to improve their efficiency and effectiveness in table-based reasoning tasks.

Method: The method involves a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that uses LLM-generated column descriptions, clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores to prune uninformative columns and rows in tables.

Result: The experiments show that ATF reduces table cells by approximately 70%, leading to improved performance on out-of-domain TableQA tasks, but with a slight performance drop on Table Fact Verification tasks where full table context is more important.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that ATF effectively balances informativeness and minimalism across different tasks, demonstrating its adaptability and efficiency in enhancing table-based reasoning for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for table-based reasoning often struggle with
large tables due to input length limits. We propose ATF (Adaptive Table
Filtering Framework), a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that
prunes uninformative columns and rows using LLM-generated column descriptions,
clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores. ATF integrates seamlessly with
existing models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that
ATF reduces table cells by ~70\%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA
tasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where
full-table context is more critical. These results highlight ATF's ability to
adaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks.

Abstract: Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows
users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain
personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents
have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively
capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences.
However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing
formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to
effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive,
unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)
that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.
Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring
a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user
needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through
Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts
high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,
we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries
of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific
datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,
TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.
Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while
generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in
managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The
code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large
language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their
impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw
puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and
systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal
model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid
task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more
slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon
through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct
samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,
mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on
correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly
learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than
algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight
RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of domain-relevant and student slang resources in existing educational datasets for the Vietnamese language.

Method: Curated NEU-ESC from university forums and used encoder-only language models (BERT) for multitask learning.

Result: Achieved 83.7% and 79.8% accuracy for sentiment and topic classification tasks using BERT.

Conclusion: The NEU-ESC dataset is publicly available and provides a valuable resource for educational NLP tasks in Vietnamese.

Abstract: In the field of education, understanding students' opinions through their
comments is crucial, especially in the Vietnamese language, where resources
remain limited. Existing educational datasets often lack domain relevance and
student slang. To address these gaps, we introduce NEU-ESC, a new Vietnamese
dataset for Educational Sentiment Classification and Topic Classification,
curated from university forums, which offers more samples, richer class
diversity, longer texts, and broader vocabulary. In addition, we explore
multitask learning using encoder-only language models (BERT), in which we
showed that it achieves performance up to 83.7% and 79.8% accuracy for
sentiment and topic classification tasks. We also benchmark our dataset and
model with other datasets and models, including Large Language Models, and
discuss these benchmarks. The dataset is publicly available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense
found in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).
Precisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in
LLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate
potential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our
study to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human
annotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting
each recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are
memorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during
training--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.
We find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in
online documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong
reliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis
beyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an
``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,
parsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,
comparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor
and annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on
ingredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale
quantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,
providing rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SemDiD, a method for semantic-guided diverse decoding in large language models, enhancing quality and diversity through embedding space mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding methods lack semantic diversity, limiting applications like Best-of-N strategies and data synthesis.

Method: SemDiD uses orthogonal directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased probability assessment in embedding space with adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization.

Result: SemDiD improves Best-of-N coverage by 1.4-5.2% and accelerates RLHF training convergence by 15% with up to 2.1% higher accuracy.

Conclusion: SemDiD effectively balances quality and semantic diversity, offering significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications
requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods
primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation
significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement
learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam
search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to
ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided
Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances
quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal
directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased
probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using
adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality
thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD
consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by
1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15%
while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make it possible to generate synthetic
behavioural data at scale, offering an ethical and low-cost alternative to
human experiments. Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological
differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We
evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to
reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation,
focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and
false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human
participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create
matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns.
Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others
diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express
personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of
personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into
modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.

Motivation: To enhance the robustness evaluation of text classification systems by developing more effective adversarial attacks that can find minimal modifications to alter model predictions.

Method: Extending BeamAttack with support for word deletions and substitution skipping, integrating LIME for word replacement prioritization, and evaluating within the BODEGA framework.

Result: Achieved over 99% attack success rate across multiple datasets and models (BiLSTM, BERT, adversarially trained RoBERTa) while preserving semantic and lexical similarity.

Conclusion: BeamAttack is effective for evaluating model robustness but has limitations that need further investigation.

Abstract: We extend BeamAttack, an adversarial attack algorithm designed to evaluate
the robustness of text classification systems through word-level modifications
guided by beam search. Our extensions include support for word deletions and
the option to skip substitutions, enabling the discovery of minimal
modifications that alter model predictions. We also integrate LIME to better
prioritize word replacements. Evaluated across multiple datasets and victim
models (BiLSTM, BERT, and adversarially trained RoBERTa) within the BODEGA
framework, our approach achieves over a 99\% attack success rate while
preserving the semantic and lexical similarity of the original texts. Through
both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we highlight BeamAttack's

Abstract: Context-aware embedding methods boost retrieval accuracy by conditioning on
corpus statistics (e.g., term co-occurrence and topical patterns) extracted
from neighboring documents. However, this context-aware approach requires
access to the target corpus or requires domain-specific finetuning, posing
practical barriers in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. We
present ZEST, a zero-shot contextual adaptation framework that replaces real
corpus access with a one-time offline synthesis of a compact proxy. Given only
a handful exemplar documents representative of the general target domain, we
use a multi-step hierarchical procedure to generate a synthetic context corpus
of several hundred documents that aims to emulate key domain-specific
distributions. At inference, the frozen context-aware encoder uses this proxy
corpus -- without any finetuning or target corpus access -- to produce
domain-adapted embeddings. Across the MTEB benchmark, ZEST's zero-shot
synthetic context adaptation using only five example documents performs within
0.5% of models leveraging full target corpus access -- demonstrating remarkable
efficacy without any retraining. ZEST thus provides a practical method for
deploying high-performance, adaptable embeddings in constrained environments.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for
multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability
and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable,
end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost,
extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier
for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce
NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action"
fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality
question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model
can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method
boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41
%. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models,
the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training
recipes on (https://github.com/cmriat/l0).

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various
tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to
fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior
work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved
evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and
multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for
close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval
introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports
multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,
challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments
addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source
LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of
7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the
largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same
perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial
effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may
overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for
evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at:

Abstract: Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model
systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of
presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias
across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.
We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option
and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more
out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high
uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty
benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality
scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive
argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order
of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically
flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both
Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias
is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when
it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an
overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose
responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens
trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and
backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that
these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective
problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token
budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel
algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced
exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained
advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target
tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from
thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks
show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves
their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance
of the base model.

LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic
issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and
implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form
over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation
on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due
to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning.
Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to
minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing
that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than
consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity
of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the
need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing
inference from available information, rather than as static output selection.
We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and
diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still
struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework,
a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs
by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and
Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an
iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using
CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism
identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections.
These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its
reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs
show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive
results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables
general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized
reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also
increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically
limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning
performance.

Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and
claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic
knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we
assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for
probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed.
To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse
Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal
activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither.
sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We
evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including
both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the
insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the
third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always
symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default
models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for
some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge
distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from
true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable
method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their
probabilistic internal knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various

remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying
linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To
investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation
framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,
designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich
languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes
unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,
from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features
like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and
Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English
performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,
especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of
Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in
LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for
improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT
framework.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate
speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.
Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent
code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content
on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is
typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource
languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this
limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on
low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -
zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot
prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to
detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the
metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that
marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We
investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and
compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,
Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer
perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated
recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in
the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource
language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The
performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and
environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity
usage, and computational time.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various
domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with
different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned
for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing
among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or
code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge
across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration
framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method
is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy,
which leverages both local functional attribution and global
information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending
this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure
efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we
introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert
alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility.
This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize
heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive
evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive
MLLMs.

Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches in sentence classification, a domain where they haven't been widely studied.

Method: Proposed a novel SAE-based architecture with a specialized classifier head and activation rate sparsity loss, evaluated against ConceptShap, ICA, and other SAE methods using two benchmarks and four Pythia LLMs.

Result: The architecture improves causality and interpretability of extracted features.

Conclusion: SAEs can be effectively tailored for text classification, offering better explainability through specialized design and sparsity constraints.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large
Language Models (LLMs) and extract interpretable concepts from their internal
representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations
that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate
the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence
classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored.
We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification,
leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate
sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such
as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept
extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and
four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis
with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based
explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show
that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the
extracted features.

supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those
trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on
TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an
open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

knowledge is largely disseminated in different forms of text, including
scientific papers, news articles, and discourse among people on social media.
While important for accelerating our pursuit of knowledge, not all scientific
text is faithful to the underlying science. As the volume of this text has
burgeoned online in recent years, it has become a problem of societal
importance to be able to identify the faithfulness of a given piece of
scientific text automatically. This thesis is concerned with the cultivation of
datasets, methods, and tools for machine understanding of scientific language,
in order to analyze and understand science communication at scale. To arrive at
this, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language
processing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited
data, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods
and resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim
generation, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels,
cite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting
exaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in
science communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of
this thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of
scientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and
generate new insights into the science communication process

*Seungjun Yi,Joakim Nguyen,Huimin Xu,Terence Lim,Andrew Well,Mia Markey,Ying Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automated LLM pipeline with a multi-agent framework and optional RLHF for end-to-end thematic analysis of clinical narratives in congenital heart disease, enabling scalable, patient-centered insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Congenital heart disease (CHD) has complex, lifelong challenges that are often not fully captured by traditional clinical metrics. Clinical narratives provide rich insights but manual analysis is time-consuming and not scalable.

Method: The paper introduces a fully automated large language model (LLM) pipeline using a novel multi-agent framework where specialized LLM agents take on roles to improve theme quality and alignment with human analysis. It also incorporates reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to enhance thematic relevance.

Result: The system enables scalable, patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets without manual coding or full transcript review. It allows LLMs to be fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts, improving theme quality and alignment with human analysis.

Conclusion: This automated pipeline offers a solution for efficiently analyzing clinical narratives in CHD, providing deeper insights into patient and caregiver experiences while being scalable and adaptable to different clinical settings.

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often
underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives
offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic
analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully
automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on
clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full
transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where
specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with
human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable,
patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be
fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question
of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support
mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle
textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word
problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the
real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We
conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including
three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in
research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical
word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the
conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs
and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled
mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics
education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most
popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require
a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our
evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems
shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,
including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed
weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or
non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have
mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,
which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics
classrooms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of standardized criteria for explanations in existing evaluation metrics for image captioning, aiming to improve the overall quality of generated explanations.

Method: The method involves constructing large-scale datasets of high-quality structured explanations and developing a two-stage evaluation template to supervise a vision-language model for scoring and explanation generation.

Result: EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets and provides higher-quality explanations than existing metrics, validated by human evaluation.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that EXPERT offers a promising approach for explainable image captioning evaluation with improved explanation quality and standardized criteria.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led
to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning.
However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and
the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this
paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides
structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency,
relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of
high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation
template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and
explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark
datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than
existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation. Our code

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against
catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus
model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including
Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the
security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or
attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an
open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted
input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard
model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack
success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second,
we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on
ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier
pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33%
ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no
access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations
that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper links a language model's text prediction ability to the breadth of its embedding space, showing that higher representation dispersion leads to lower perplexity and offering practical applications for model selection, representation retrieval, and training objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between a language model's text prediction capability and the structure of its embedding space, and to explore practical applications of this relationship without labeled data.

Method: The study examines the correlation between representation dispersion (average pairwise cosine distance among hidden vectors) and perplexity across different models and domains. It also introduces a push-away training objective to increase dispersion.

Result: Representation dispersion is strongly and negatively correlated with perplexity. Dispersion measurements can predict downstream accuracy, identify optimal layers for retrieval methods, and improve perplexity through a push-away objective.

Conclusion: The breadth of the embedding space, as measured by dispersion, is crucial for a model's text prediction performance. Enhancing dispersion through training objectives can lead to better models without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to
the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual
representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we
find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance
among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity
across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,
news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how
dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring
labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to
predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for
model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion
pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,
bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple
push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both
single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in
each.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is crucial for understanding intertextual relationships, but traditional manual methods are time-consuming and error-prone.

Method: The study evaluated transformer-based models (E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, LaBSE) by generating word embeddings for passages in Samuel/Kings and Chronicles, using cosine similarity and Wasserstein Distance to compare parallel vs. non-parallel texts.

Result: E5 performed well in detecting parallels, while AlephBERT was better at distinguishing non-parallel passages, indicating their potential to enhance efficiency and accuracy in ancient text analysis.

Conclusion: Pre-trained transformer models can effectively aid in identifying intertextual parallels in ancient texts like the Hebrew Bible, with implications for broader applications in ancient language studies.

Abstract: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is foundational in biblical
scholarship for uncovering intertextual relationships. Traditional methods rely
on manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This
study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,
including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in
the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings
and Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings
that delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity
and Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show
significant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT
demonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate
that pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting
intertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for
ancient language studies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free sampling algorithm for diffusion models that achieves provable acceleration by using high-order ODE solvers and Lagrange interpolation, requiring fewer score function evaluations compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to accelerate diffusion models without retraining, focusing on efficiently approximating target data distributions within a specified total-variation distance.

Method: The method involves a training-free sampling algorithm inspired by high-order ODE solvers, using high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement to approximate the probability flow ODE integral.

Result: The algorithm requires $d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K}$ score function evaluations (up to log factors) for accurate approximation, applicable to a wide range of data distributions without smoothness or log-concavity assumptions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their approach provides a robust, efficient method for diffusion model sampling with provable guarantees, even with inexact score estimates, and avoids restrictive assumptions on the target distribution.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without
any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data
distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation
distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that
requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate
scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to
a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions
such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact
score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases
-- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed
in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE
solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement
to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the performance of
Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional
layers and addressing the critical challenges associated with them. Traditional
quanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely
been static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our
research overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers,
significantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the
introduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities
in gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing
gradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel
architecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging
the concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by
adding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between
quanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the
network, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide
empirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within
QuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient
configuration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers
in the network that eventually results in efficient training. Our findings
suggest that the precise location of residual blocks plays a crucial role in
maximizing the performance gains in QuNNs. Our results mark a substantial step
forward in the evolution of quantum deep learning, offering new avenues for
both theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) rely heavily on complete and
high-quality spatiotemporal traffic data to achieve optimal performance.
Nevertheless, in real-word traffic data collection processes, issues such as
communication failures and sensor malfunctions often lead to incomplete or
corrupted datasets, thereby posing significant challenges to the advancement of
ITS. Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data,
the latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted
and effective solution. However, conventional LFT models typically employ the
standard L2-norm in their learning objective, which makes them vulnerable to
the influence of outliers. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a
threshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of
Tensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the
model's sensitivity to outliers by assigning differentiated weights to
individual samples. Extensive experiments conducted on two traffic speed
datasets sourced from diverse urban environments confirm that the proposed
TDWLFT model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
both in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems play a critical role in the infrastructure of various
sectors, including manufacturing, energy distribution, and autonomous
transportation systems. However, their increasing connectivity renders them
highly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, such as adaptive and zero-day
attacks, against which traditional security methods like rule-based intrusion
detection and single-agent reinforcement learning prove insufficient. To
overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Hierarchical
Adversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HAMARL) framework.
HAMARL employs a hierarchical structure consisting of local agents dedicated to
subsystem security and a global coordinator that oversees and optimizes
comprehensive, system-wide defense strategies. Furthermore, the framework
incorporates an adversarial training loop designed to simulate and anticipate
evolving cyber threats, enabling proactive defense adaptation. Extensive
experimental evaluations conducted on a simulated industrial IoT testbed
indicate that HAMARL substantially outperforms traditional multi-agent
reinforcement learning approaches, significantly improving attack detection
accuracy, reducing response times, and ensuring operational continuity. The
results underscore the effectiveness of combining hierarchical multi-agent
coordination with adversarially-aware training to enhance the resilience and
security of next-generation CPS.

Abstract: Accurate cancer survival prediction requires integration of diverse data
modalities that reflect the complex interplay between imaging, clinical
parameters, and textual reports. However, existing multimodal approaches suffer
from simplistic fusion strategies, massive computational requirements, and lack
of interpretability-critical barriers to clinical adoption. We present EAGLE
(Efficient Alignment of Generalized Latent Embeddings), a novel deep learning
framework that addresses these limitations through attention-based multimodal
fusion with comprehensive attribution analysis. EAGLE introduces four key
innovations: (1) dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms that learn
hierarchical relationships between modalities, (2) massive dimensionality
reduction (99.96%) while maintaining predictive performance, (3) three
complementary attribution methods providing patient-level interpretability, and
(4) a unified pipeline enabling seamless adaptation across cancer types. We
evaluated EAGLE on 911 patients across three distinct malignancies:
glioblastoma (GBM, n=160), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN,
n=171), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=580). Patient-level analysis
showed high-risk individuals relied more heavily on adverse imaging features,
while low-risk patients demonstrated balanced modality contributions. Risk
stratification identified clinically meaningful groups with 4-fold (GBM) to
5-fold (NSCLC) differences in median survival, directly informing treatment
intensity decisions. By combining state-of-the-art performance with clinical
interpretability, EAGLE bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and
practical healthcare deployment, offering a scalable solution for multimodal
survival prediction that enhances both prognostic accuracy and physician trust
in automated predictions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate
dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in
regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic
downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited
flexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven
alternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that
downscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual
awareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our
study addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable
Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and
variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts
three key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind),
and 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs,
emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable
approach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently
outperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while
also improving computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-variable modeling for high-resolution climate
downscaling.

Abstract: The residual stream acts as a memory bus where transformer layers both store
and access features (Elhage et al., 2021). We consider changing the mechanism
for retrieving and storing information in the residual stream, and replace the
residual stream of the transformer with an outer product memory matrix
(Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972). We call this model the Residual Matrix
Transformer (RMT). We find that the RMT enjoys a number of attractive
properties: 1) the size of the residual stream can be scaled independently of
compute and model size, improving performance, 2) the RMT can achieve the same
loss as the transformer with 58% fewer FLOPS, 25% fewer parameters, and 41%
fewer training tokens tokens, and 3) the RMT outperforms the transformer on
downstream evaluations. We theoretically analyze the transformer and the RMT,
and show that the RMT allows for more efficient scaling of the residual stream,
as well as improved variance propagation properties. Code for this project can
be found at https://github.com/bmac3/residual-matrix-transformer.

Motivation: Exploration is a critical challenge in RL, especially when rewards are sparse or adversarial. Understanding how policy architecture affects exploration can help improve learning efficiency.

Method: The authors use a toy model to theoretically and empirically study how untrained deep neural policies generate ballistic or diffusive trajectories. They leverage infinite-width network theory and continuous-time limits to analyze action correlation and state-visitation distributions.

Result: Untrained policies produce correlated actions and non-trivial state-visitation distributions. The study reveals insights into inductive biases that affect exploration behavior in early training stages.

Conclusion: The research provides a framework for using policy initialization as a tool to design and understand exploration strategies in RL, offering both theoretical and experimental support.

Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In
this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly
shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically
demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from
untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks
and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated
actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss
the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard
architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling
exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for
using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior

TL;DR: BEST-Route is a new way to send questions to different language models based on how hard the question is and how good the answer needs to be, which saves money without losing much quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to save money when using big language models by not using them for every question, but instead using smaller models when they can provide a good enough answer.

Method: BEST-Route picks which model to use and how many answers to get from it depending on how hard the question is and how good the answers need to be.

Result: Testing showed that BEST-Route can save up to 60% on costs with only a small drop in how well it works.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that BEST-Route is a good method for saving money when using large language models by wisely choosing when to use smaller models and how many answers to get from them.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools but are often expensive to
deploy at scale. LLM query routing mitigates this by dynamically assigning
queries to models of varying cost and quality to obtain a desired trade-off.
Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selected
model and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not good
enough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they end
up overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings.
However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responses
and selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than a
single large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, a
novel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses to
sample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs by
up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently
garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical
yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both
RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI)
maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within
this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform
contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from
the base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI
(equivalently, the MINE estimator). This paradigm further explains why RLHF may
not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is
already present in the base model. Building on this perspective, we replace the
DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator and propose Mutual
Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and
extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage
decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior
performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.
We will release the model and code upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide task-specific uncertainty quantification for transformer models, which is more tailored and effective for downstream workflows compared to general-purpose methods.

Method: Integrating MC-Dropout into Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) to create a framework that allows agents to assess and adjust their behavior when facing uncertainty.

Result: LoRA adapters show increased variance when outside the fine-tuning distribution, leading to more reliable confidence estimates for agentic decision-making.

Conclusion: BayesLoRA offers a specialized approach to uncertainty quantification in transformers, improving the reliability of confidence estimates for agents in downstream tasks.

Abstract: We propose BayesLoRA, a task-specific uncertainty quantification framework
that integrates MC-Dropout into Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA). Unlike
general-purpose transformer uncertainty methods, BayesLoRA provides guardrails
tailored to downstream workflows, enabling agents to introspect and modulate
behavior under uncertainty. We demonstrate mathematically and empirically that
LoRA adapters exhibit amplified variance outside fine-tuning distributions,
yielding reliable confidence estimates for agentic decision-making.

### [363] [Layer Importance for Mathematical Reasoning is Forged in Pre-Training and Invariant after Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22638)
*Aadim Nepal,Safal Shrestha,Anubhav Shrestha,Minwu Kim,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-training methods like instruction tuning and RL improve math reasoning in LLMs, but the core layer structure remains similar. Critical layers for math tasks are identified, and removing them drastically reduces performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding if post-training improvements in math reasoning come from major changes in transformer layers or minor adjustments.

Method: Systematic layer-wise ablation experiments on different post-training variants (base, instruction-tuned, knowledge-distilled, RL) using math reasoning benchmarks.

Result: Mathematical reasoning has a specific layer importance structure that remains consistent across post-training methods. Removing critical layers leads to up to 80% accuracy drop, unlike non-math tasks which lack critical layers.

Conclusion: Math reasoning requires specialized layers that develop during pre-training, whereas non-reasoning tasks don't. Critical layers for math are where major representational transformations happen.

Abstract: Large language models can exhibit improved mathematical reasoning
capabilities following post-training with instruction tuning, reinforcement
learning, or knowledge distillation. However, it remains unclear whether these
improvements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor
adjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base
model largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic
layer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned,
knowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise
to a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across
all post-training paradigms. Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up
to 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no
critical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires
specialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning
tasks do not. From an information-theoretic perspective, we also observe that
these critical layers are the same layers where major representational
transformation occurs.

*Selahattin Akkas,Aditya Devarakonda,Ariful Azad*

TL;DR: DistShap is a parallel algorithm that uses Shapley values to explain GNN predictions efficiently across multiple GPUs, scaling to millions of features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining GNN predictions is crucial as their use grows, but existing methods are too slow for large graphs with many features.

Method: DistShap samples subgraphs in a distributed environment, runs GNN inference on multiple GPUs simultaneously, and solves a least squares problem to determine edge importance.

Result: DistShap achieves higher accuracy than current methods and can handle GNNs with millions of features using 128 GPUs on the Perlmutter supercomputer.

Conclusion: DistShap provides a scalable and accurate solution for explaining GNN predictions, enabling better interpretability for large models.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), explaining their
predictions has become increasingly important. However, attributing predictions
to specific edges or features remains computationally expensive. For example,
classifying a node with 100 neighbors using a 3-layer GNN may involve
identifying important edges from millions of candidates contributing to the
prediction. To address this challenge, we propose DistShap, a parallel
algorithm that distributes Shapley value-based explanations across multiple
GPUs. DistShap operates by sampling subgraphs in a distributed setting,
executing GNN inference in parallel across GPUs, and solving a distributed
least squares problem to compute edge importance scores. DistShap outperforms
most existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and is the first to scale to
GNN models with millions of features by using up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC
Perlmutter supercomputer.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLUs) have become essential components in the
feed-forward networks of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, they require twice as many memory reads compared to feed-forward
layers without gating, due to the use of separate weight matrices for the gate
and value streams. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Masked Gated Linear
Units (MGLUs), a novel family of GLUs with an efficient kernel implementation.
The core contribution of MGLUs include: (1) the Mixture of Element-wise Gating
(MoEG) architecture that learns multiple binary masks, each determining gate or
value assignments at the element level on a single shared weight matrix
resulting in reduced memory transfer, and (2) FlashMGLU, a hardware-friendly
kernel that yields up to a 19.7 $\times$ inference-time speed-up over a naive
PyTorch MGLU and is 47% more memory-efficient and 34% faster than standard GLUs
despite added architectural complexity on an RTX5090 GPU. In LLM experiments,
the Swish-activated variant SwiMGLU preserves its memory advantages while
matching - or even surpassing - the downstream accuracy of the SwiGLU baseline.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Backpropagation has been the cornerstone of neural network training for
decades, yet its inefficiencies in time and energy consumption limit its
suitability for resource-constrained edge devices. While low-precision neural
network quantization has been extensively researched to speed up model
inference, its application in training has been less explored. Recently, the
Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm has emerged as a promising alternative to
backpropagation, replacing the backward pass with an additional forward pass.
By avoiding the need to store intermediate activations for backpropagation, FF
can reduce memory footprint, making it well-suited for embedded devices. This
paper presents an INT8 quantized training approach that leverages FF's
layer-by-layer strategy to stabilize gradient quantization. Furthermore, we
propose a novel "look-ahead" scheme to address limitations of FF and improve
model accuracy. Experiments conducted on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board
demonstrate 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, and 27.0% reduction in
memory usage, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to the
state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the skepticism around SAEs by reconciling negative and positive results through a conceptual distinction.

Method: The paper presents a conceptual analysis of SAEs, differentiating their effectiveness based on known vs. unknown concepts.

Result: The conceptual distinction explains existing conflicting results and identifies SAEs as useful for discovering unknown concepts.

Conclusion: SAEs have valuable applications in ML interpretability and social/health sciences despite their limitations with known concepts.

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have generated significant excitement, a
series of negative results have added to skepticism about their usefulness.
Here, we establish a conceptual distinction that reconciles competing
narratives surrounding SAEs. We argue that while SAEs may be less effective for
acting on known concepts, SAEs are powerful tools for discovering unknown
concepts. This distinction cleanly separates existing negative and positive
results, and suggests several classes of SAE applications. Specifically, we
outline use cases for SAEs in (i) ML interpretability, explainability,
fairness, auditing, and safety, and (ii) social and health sciences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary platforms, which hinder data exchange and user freedom. Market leaders have little incentive to enable interoperability.

Method: Propose the concept of universal interoperability mediated by LLM-based agents, which automatically translate data formats and interact with human-designed interfaces.

Result: Universal interoperability makes data exchange cheaper and unavoidable, undermining monopolies and promoting data portability.

Conclusion: The ML community should adopt this development while creating frameworks to mitigate security risks and technical debt, to restore user freedom and competitive markets without compromising security.

Abstract: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and
universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary
platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and
market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode
their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this
status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and
interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability
dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal
interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data
seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines
monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also
lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML
community should embrace this development while building the appropriate
frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to
restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive
multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity
needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This
architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless
compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear
memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to
Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM
for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the
first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM
architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder
processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is
devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach,
the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the
reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded
counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions:
Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider
local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We
evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17
real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR.
In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23
popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the
powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way
for exciting new developments on this subject. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a prominent approach in Quantum Machine
Learning (QML), are emerging as a powerful alternative to classical machine
learning methods. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of QNNs to
various tasks, such as time-series forecasting, prediction, and classification,
across a wide range of applications, including cybersecurity and medical
imaging. With the increased use of smart grids driven by the integration of
renewable energy systems, machine learning plays an important role in
predicting power demand and detecting system disturbances. This study provides
an in-depth investigation of QNNs for predicting the power output of a wind
turbine. We assess the predictive performance and simulation time of six QNN
configurations that are based on the Z Feature Map for data encoding and
varying ansatz structures. Through detailed cross-validation experiments and
tests on an unseen hold-out dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that QNNs
can achieve predictive performance that is competitive with, and in some cases
marginally better than, the benchmarked classical approaches. Our results also
reveal the effects of dataset size and circuit complexity on predictive
performance and simulation time. We believe our findings will offer valuable
insights for researchers in the energy domain who wish to incorporate quantum
machine learning into their work.

Abstract: Learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) from data is challenging,
especially for datasets involving a large number of variables. The recently
proposed divide-and-conquer (D\&D) strategies present a promising approach for
learning large BNs. However, they still face a main issue of unstable learning
accuracy across subproblems. In this work, we introduce the idea of employing
structure learning ensemble (SLE), which combines multiple BN structure
learning algorithms, to consistently achieve high learning accuracy. We further
propose an automatic approach called Auto-SLE for learning near-optimal SLEs,
addressing the challenge of manually designing high-quality SLEs. The learned
SLE is then integrated into a D\&D method. Extensive experiments firmly show
the superiority of our method over D\&D methods with single BN structure
learning algorithm in learning large BNs, achieving accuracy improvement
usually by 30\%$\sim$225\% on datasets involving 10,000 variables. Furthermore,
our method generalizes well to datasets with many more (e.g., 30000) variables
and different network characteristics than those present in the training data
for learning the SLE. These results indicate the significant potential of
employing (automatic learning of) SLEs for scalable BN structure learning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Time series autoregression is a classical statistical model for capturing
auto-correlations and identifying temporal patterns such as periodicity and
seasonality. In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework
from an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model
interpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\ell_0$-norm
induced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we
reformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization
problem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a
subspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the
search space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated
spatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying
sparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by
developing a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme
makes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision
variables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
proposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the
MIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while
maintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the
time-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover
both daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity
of human mobility. Second, we demonstrate the spatial patterns of yearly
seasonality in climate variable time series such as temperature and
precipitation across the past four decades, and our model allows to discover
dynamic climate patterns and identify climate phenomena such as El Nino in sea
surface temperature.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing
modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients.
Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing
modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with
partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality
patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the
number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET
(Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with
partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention
mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their
importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the
number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate
predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal
embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality
missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on
three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world
instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the
state-of-the-art fusion methods. The data and code are available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a flexible way to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning, yet they still
fall well short of the machine-precision accuracy many scientific tasks demand.
In this work, we investigate whether the precision ceiling comes from the
ill-conditioning of the PDEs or from the typical multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture. We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models
the PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be
added on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely
(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we
take derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental
precision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even
MLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above
float64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,
adding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable
accuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully
characterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it
during training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five
benchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for
convection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining
compatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an
explicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave
problems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the
performance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson
problems. Together, these findings point to a practical path for combining the
flexibility of PINNs with the precision of classical spectral solvers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across research and
industry applications, yet their inference efficiency remains a significant
challenge. As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously
improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally,
creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we
investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware
training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the
scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that
TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model
parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite
of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained
performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we
propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which
demonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also,
building on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that
accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to
floating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of
TriLMs, we will release the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels.
Overall, our work lays the foundation for building and deploying efficient
LLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities
in producing human-like text. However, it is unclear how accurately these
models internalize concepts that shape human thought and behavior. Here, we
developed a quantitative framework to assess concept alignment between LLMs and
human psychological dimensions using 43 standardized psychological
questionnaires, selected for their established validity in measuring distinct
psychological constructs. Our method evaluates how accurately language models
reconstruct and classify questionnaire items through pairwise similarity
analysis. We compared resulting cluster structures with the original
categorical labels using hierarchical clustering. A GPT-4 model achieved
superior classification accuracy (66.2\%), significantly outperforming GPT-3.5
(55.9\%) and BERT (48.1\%), all exceeding random baseline performance (31.9\%).
We also demonstrated that the estimated semantic similarity from GPT-4 is
associated with Pearson's correlation coefficients of human responses in
multiple psychological questionnaires. This framework provides a novel approach
to evaluate the alignment of the human-LLM concept and identify potential
representational biases. Our findings demonstrate that modern LLMs can
approximate human psychological constructs with measurable accuracy, offering
insights for developing more interpretable AI systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has
a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to
every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is
often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow
observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world
model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very
observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal
Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently
encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across
different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of
multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent
state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a
\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta
states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal
relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)
iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven
exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a
challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly
captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously
unseen contexts.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in synthetic data quality, which affects the performance of wireless sensing tasks when using all synthetic data.

Method: The method involves proposing tractable and generalizable metrics for synthetic data quality (affinity and diversity) and introducing SynCheck, a quality-guided utilization scheme during training.

Result: The result shows that SynCheck consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a 4.3% performance improvement even when prior methods degraded performance by 13.4%.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that SynCheck effectively mitigates synthetic data quality issues, leading to better task performance in wireless sensing.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention for their ability to
produce realistic synthetic data that supplements the quantity of real-world
datasets. While recent studies show performance improvements in wireless
sensing tasks by incorporating all synthetic data into training sets, the
quality of synthetic data remains unpredictable and the resulting performance
gains are not guaranteed. To address this gap, we propose tractable and
generalizable metrics to quantify quality attributes of synthetic data -
affinity and diversity. Our assessment reveals prevalent affinity limitation in
current wireless synthetic data, leading to mislabeled data and degraded task
performance. We attribute the quality limitation to generative models' lack of
awareness of untrained conditions and domain-specific processing. To mitigate
these issues, we introduce SynCheck, a quality-guided synthetic data
utilization scheme that refines synthetic data quality during task model
training. Our evaluation demonstrates that SynCheck consistently outperforms
quality-oblivious utilization of synthetic data, and achieves 4.3% performance
improvement even when the previous utilization degrades performance by 13.4%.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance federated learning (FL) model performance to meet diverse user needs, as current FL methods may not sufficiently satisfy expectations due to privacy constraints.

Method: The method involves a reference model-based federated learning framework derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning, incorporating an optimal proximal term and using a reference model with previous parameters to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: The result demonstrates that the proposed method achieves high model performance with low computational cost, effectively addressing catastrophic forgetting in each round.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that the reference model-based approach improves FL model optimization, enabling better personalization and meeting user expectations while preserving data privacy.

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial
intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning
scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of
concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy.
However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently
satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of
different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types
of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or
personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model
optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning
for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round.
This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning,
which includes an optimal proximal term and enables overcoming the catastrophic
forgetting issue in each round by utilizing a reference model that incorporates
previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model
performance and low computing cost.

*Hans Peter Lynsgøe Raaschou-jensen,Constanza Fierro,Anders Søgaard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods for predicting model 'thinking time' to improve user experience with reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users lack insight into the time reasoning models take, causing frustration and inefficiency.

Method: Developing online and offline prediction methods for model reasoning time.

Result: The methods enable a practical 'progress bar for reasoning' to enhance user interaction.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of thinking time prediction for better user experience and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Reasoning models that produce long, hidden chains of thought have emerged as
powerful tools for complex, reasoning-intensive
tasks\citep{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability,
openai2024openaio1card}. However, this paradigm introduces a new user
experience challenge: users have little insight into how much time the model
will spend reasoning before returning an answer. This unpredictability, can
lead to user frustration and is likely to compound as LLMs can produce
increasingly long tasks asynchronously
\citep{kwa2025measuringaiabilitycomplete}. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate methods for both online and offline prediction of model "thinking
time," aiming to develop a practical "progress bar for reasoning." We discuss
the implications for user interaction and future research directions.

Abstract: Developing a better understanding of surprising or counterintuitive phenomena
has constituted a significant portion of deep learning research in recent
years. These include double descent, grokking, and the lottery ticket
hypothesis -- among many others. Works in this area often develop ad hoc
hypotheses attempting to explain these observed phenomena on an isolated,
case-by-case basis. This position paper asserts that, in many prominent cases,
there is little evidence to suggest that these phenomena appear in real-world
applications and these efforts may be inefficient in driving progress in the
broader field. Consequently, we argue against viewing them as isolated puzzles
that require bespoke resolutions or explanations. However, despite this, we
suggest that deep learning phenomena do still offer research value by providing
unique settings in which we can refine our broad explanatory theories of more
general deep learning principles. This position is reinforced by analyzing the
research outcomes of several prominent examples of these phenomena from the
recent literature. We revisit the current norms in the research community in
approaching these problems and propose practical recommendations for future
research, aiming to ensure that progress on deep learning phenomena is well
aligned with the ultimate pragmatic goal of progress in the broader field of
deep learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific
discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and
domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug
discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce
chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a
systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven
molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical
structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering,
automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure
reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond
the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for
scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability
improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate
promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted
improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We
provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation
architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for
applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is
essential.

TL;DR: FTS is a framework for training generative models on distributed EHR data, using tokenized patient timelines and a global generator to synthesize data, achieving results comparable to real data with strong privacy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to train generative foundation models on distributed time-series data from EHRs while ensuring privacy and scalability across institutions.

Method: FTS uses autoregressive transformers trained locally on PHTs (tokenized patient timelines) and a central server that synthesizes trajectories with a Global Generator for zero-shot inference.

Result: Models trained on synthetic data from GG perform as well as those trained on real data in five prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV.

Conclusion: FTS provides strong privacy, scalability, and flexibility for healthcare applications like counterfactual inference and synthetic trials.

Abstract: We present Federated Timeline Synthesis (FTS), a novel framework for training
generative foundation models across distributed timeseries data applied to
electronic health records (EHR). At its core, FTS represents patient history as
tokenized Patient Health Timelines (PHTs), language-agnostic sequences encoding
temporal, categorical, and continuous clinical information. Each institution
trains an autoregressive transformer on its local PHTs and transmits only model
weights to a central server. The server uses the generators to synthesize a
large corpus of trajectories and train a Global Generator (GG), enabling
zero-shot inference via Monte Carlo simulation of future PHTs. We evaluate FTS
on five clinically meaningful prediction tasks using MIMIC-IV data, showing
that models trained on synthetic data generated by GG perform comparably to
those trained on real data. FTS offers strong privacy guarantees, scalability
across institutions, and extensibility to diverse prediction and simulation
tasks especially in healthcare, including counterfactual inference, early
warning detection, and synthetic trial design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the scarcity of benchmark datasets in computational science due to problem uniqueness and rapid domain changes, making it hard to evaluate new methods.

Method: BenchMake employs non-negative matrix factorization to detect edge cases on the convex hull and partitions data into testing sets that maximize divergence and significance.

Result: The tool was tested against established and random splits on ten diverse scientific benchmark datasets, showing effectiveness in creating meaningful testing splits.

Conclusion: BenchMake can transform open datasets into accessible benchmarks, aiding computational scientists in evaluating innovations more reliably.

Abstract: Benchmark data sets are a cornerstone of machine learning development and
applications, ensuring new methods are robust, reliable and competitive. The
relative rarity of benchmark sets in computational science, due to the
uniqueness of the problems and the pace of change in the associated domains,
makes evaluating new innovations difficult for computational scientists. In
this paper a new tool is developed and tested to potentially turn any of the
increasing numbers of scientific data sets made openly available into a
benchmark accessible to the community. BenchMake uses non-negative matrix
factorisation to deterministically identify and isolate challenging edge cases
on the convex hull (the smallest convex set that contains all existing data
instances) and partitions a required fraction of matched data instances into a
testing set that maximises divergence and statistical significance, across
tabular, graph, image, signal and textual modalities. BenchMake splits are
compared to establish splits and random splits using ten publicly available
benchmark sets from different areas of science, with different sizes, shapes,
distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PETSA is a parameter-efficient test-time adaptation method for time series forecasting that updates only small calibration modules, using low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without retraining, with a specialized loss function combining robust, frequency-domain, and patch-wise structural terms to maintain accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series are non-stationary, which hurts the performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Existing TTA methods update the full model, which is costly in terms of memory and computation.

Method: PETSA adapts forecasters at test time by updating small calibration modules on input and output, using low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without retraining. It introduces a specialized loss with three components: robust term, frequency-domain term for periodicity, and patch-wise structural term for structural alignment.

Result: PETSA improves adaptability of various forecasting backbones with fewer parameters than baselines. Experimental results show competitive or better performance across all horizons on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: PETSA is an effective parameter-efficient TTA method for time series forecasting, achieving good performance with limited adaptation resources.

Abstract: Real-world time series often exhibit a non-stationary nature, degrading the
performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods
typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We
propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test
time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA
uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without
retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we
introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2)
a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise
structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of
various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved predictive
accuracy. However, modern neural networks remain systematically overconfident,
posing risks for deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Current post-hoc
calibration methods face a fundamental dilemma: global approaches like
Temperature Scaling apply uniform adjustments across all samples, introducing
high bias despite computational efficiency, while more expressive methods that
operate on full logit distributions suffer from high variance due to noisy
high-dimensional inputs and insufficient validation data. To address these
challenges, we propose Sample Margin-Aware Recalibration of Temperature
(SMART), a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method that precisely
scales logits based on the margin between the top two logits -- termed the
logit gap. Specifically, the logit gap serves as a denoised, scalar signal
directly tied to decision boundary uncertainty, providing a robust indicator
that avoids the noise inherent in high-dimensional logit spaces while
preserving model prediction invariance. Meanwhile, SMART employs a novel
soft-binned Expected Calibration Error (SoftECE) objective that balances model
bias and variance through adaptive binning, enabling stable parameter updates
even with extremely limited calibration data. Extensive evaluations across
diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SMART achieves
state-of-the-art calibration performance even with substantially fewer
parameters compared to existing parametric methods, offering a principled,
robust, and highly efficient solution for practical uncertainty quantification
in neural network predictions. The source code is available at:

Motivation: To address performance degradation in FL caused by data heterogeneity and communication constraints.

Method: Integrates weight standardization (WS) to filter biased local updates and distribution-aware non-uniform quantization (DANUQ) to minimize quantization errors.

Result: FedWSQ reduces communication overhead while maintaining high model accuracy, outperforming existing methods in challenging FL settings.

Conclusion: FedWSQ is effective in handling data heterogeneity and low-bit communication, making it a robust FL framework.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key
challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address
these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which
integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware
non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out
biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the
robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client
participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging
the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ
significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model
accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging
FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit
communication scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have significantly advanced media
generation, yet their design space is well-explored, somewhat limiting further
improvements. Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those
generating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for
unifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching
(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies
and advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM
decomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing
for expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary
non-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design
avenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference
Transition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by
directly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image
quality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)
Autoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition
Matching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that
generalize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation
quality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless
integration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the
first fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based
methods on text-to-image task in continuous domains. We demonstrate these
contributions through a rigorous large-scale comparison of TM variants and
relevant baselines, maintaining a fixed architecture, training data, and
hyperparameters.

Abstract: Recently, forecasting future abnormal events has emerged as an important
scenario to tackle real-world necessities. However, the solution of predicting
specific future time points when anomalies will occur, known as Anomaly
Prediction (AP), remains under-explored. Existing methods dealing with time
series data fail in AP, focusing only on immediate anomalies or failing to
provide precise predictions for future anomalies. To address the AP task, we
propose a novel framework called Anomaly to Prompt (A2P), comprised of
Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP). To
enable the forecasting model to forecast abnormal time points, we adopt a
strategy to learn the relationships of anomalies. For the robust detection of
anomalies, our proposed SAP introduces a learnable Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP)
that simulates diverse anomaly patterns using signal adaptive prompt.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of A2P over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to
predict future anomalies. Our implementation code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The integrity of Water Quality Data (WQD) is critical in environmental
monitoring for scientific decision-making and ecological protection. However,
water quality monitoring systems are often challenged by large amounts of
missing data due to unavoidable problems such as sensor failures and
communication delays, which further lead to water quality data becoming
High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS). Traditional data imputation methods are
difficult to depict the potential dynamics and fail to capture the deep data
features, resulting in unsatisfactory imputation performance. To effectively
address the above issues, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Low-rank
Representation model (NLR) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for
imputing missing WQD, which utilizes CNNs to implement two ideas: a) fusing
temporal features to model the temporal dependence of data between time slots,
and b) Extracting nonlinear interactions and local patterns to mine
higher-order relationships features and achieve deep fusion of multidimensional
information. Experimental studies on three real water quality datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art data imputation models in terms of estimation accuracy. It
provides an effective approach for handling water quality monitoring data in
complex dynamic environments.

Motivation: Modular exponentiation is important in cryptography but not well understood mechanistically. The paper aims to explore how transformers can learn and represent this mathematical operation.

Method: The authors used a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model, employing principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation patching to study the encoding of number-theoretic properties.

Result: Reciprocal operand training led to significant performance improvements and sudden generalization across moduli. A subgraph of attention heads in the final layer was sufficient for full performance in regular exponentiation.

Conclusion: Transformers learn modular arithmetic through specialized circuits, indicating potential for more interpretable and efficient neural methods in modular exponentiation.

Abstract: Modular exponentiation is crucial to number theory and cryptography, yet
remains largely unexplored from a mechanistic interpretability standpoint. We
train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and
investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing
principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation
patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the
model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance
gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized
accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model
internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting
entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full
performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that
transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational
circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches

Motivation: To address inverse problems in science and engineering by improving existing methods for recovering signals from incomplete or noisy measurements.

Method: Introducing SDBs, which are supervised bridge methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE.

Result: Consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and robust generalization under system misspecification between training and deployment.

Conclusion: SDBs offer a promising solution for real-world applications in solving inverse problems.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy
measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based
generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this
task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt
pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods
that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data.
While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the
latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System
embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge
methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the
coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields
consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates
robust generalization under system misspecification between training and
deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance
on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with
actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in
safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek
to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop
statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings,
thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph
topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a
post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on
tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the
scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence
estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring
logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets
with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS
achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared
methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to
42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared
with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient,
scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be
released based on publication.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and rapid integration of generative models (GMs) have
sparked interest in the problem of model attribution and their fingerprints.
For instance, service providers need reliable methods of authenticating their
models to protect their IP, while users and law enforcement seek to verify the
source of generated content for accountability and trust. In addition, a
growing threat of model collapse is arising, as more model-generated data are
being fed back into sources (e.g., YouTube) that are often harvested for
training ("regurgitative training"), heightening the need to differentiate
synthetic from human data. Yet, a gap still exists in understanding generative
models' fingerprints, we believe, stemming from the lack of a formal framework
that can define, represent, and analyze the fingerprints in a principled way.
To address this gap, we take a geometric approach and propose a new definition
of artifact and fingerprint of GMs using Riemannian geometry, which allows us
to leverage the rich theory of differential geometry. Our new definition
generalizes previous work (Song et al., 2024) to non-Euclidean manifolds by
learning Riemannian metrics from data and replacing the Euclidean distances and
nearest-neighbor search with geodesic distances and kNN-based Riemannian center
of mass. We apply our theory to a new gradient-based algorithm for computing
the fingerprints in practice. Results show that it is more effective in
distinguishing a large array of GMs, spanning across 4 different datasets in 2
different resolutions (64 by 64, 256 by 256), 27 model architectures, and 2
modalities (Vision, Vision-Language). Using our proposed definition
significantly improves the performance on model attribution, as well as a
generalization to unseen datasets, model types, and modalities, suggesting its
practical efficacy.

Abstract: The chain of thought is fundamental in Transformers, which is to perform
step-by-step reasoning. Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of
these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study
addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder
input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn
arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture
of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign
orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space
grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical
approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four
order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a
learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the
multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior
studies.

*Miguel Camacho-Sánchez,Fernando García-Torres,Jesper John Lisegaard,Rocío del Amor,Sankhya Mohanty,Valery Naranjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning strategy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to synchronize resin flow fronts in composites manufacturing, showing effectiveness in improving process control and product quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling resin flow dynamics in processes like Resin Infusion (RI) and Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) is crucial to prevent defects such as porosities and dry spots, ensuring structural integrity in large-scale composite components.

Method: The study employs a reinforcement learning approach, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to manage resin flow fronts in a scenario with two inlets and one outlet, using process simulations for strategy development.

Result: The RL-based strategy effectively achieves accurate resin flow convergence, demonstrating potential for enhancing process control and product quality in composites manufacturing.

Conclusion: The application of reinforcement learning, particularly PPO, shows promise in improving the control of resin flow dynamics, leading to better quality and reliability in fibre-reinforced polymer composite manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Resin infusion (RI) and resin transfer moulding (RTM) are critical processes
for the manufacturing of high-performance fibre-reinforced polymer composites,
particularly for large-scale applications such as wind turbine blades.
Controlling the resin flow dynamics in these processes is critical to ensure
the uniform impregnation of the fibre reinforcements, thereby preventing
residual porosities and dry spots that impact the consequent structural
integrity of the final component. This paper presents a reinforcement learning
(RL) based strategy, established using process simulations, for synchronising
the different resin flow fronts in an infusion scenario involving two resin
inlets and a single outlet. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), our
approach addresses the challenge of managing the fluid dynamics in a partially
observable environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL
approach in achieving an accurate flow convergence, highlighting its potential
towards improving process control and product quality in composites
manufacturing.

### [400] [ReMem: Mutual Information-Aware Fine-tuning of Pretrained Vision Transformers for Effective Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23041)
*Chengyu Dong,Huan Gui,Noveen Sachdeva,Long Jin,Ke Yin,Jingbo Shang,Lichan Hong,Ed H. Chi,Zhe Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of knowledge distillation from large-scale pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by proposing mutual information-aware optimization and MLP block reweighting, allowing small student models to effectively benefit from strong pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of knowledge distillation from strong, large-scale pretrained models drops significantly, and existing methods are not sufficient for small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets.

Method: We explore methods to fine-tune ViTs for better knowledge transfer, employing mutual information-aware optimization and introducing MLP block reweighting as a heuristic for small or imbalanced datasets.

Result: The proposed method allows small student models to effectively benefit from strong pretrained models, improving knowledge distillation performance.

Conclusion: By fine-tuning ViTs with mutual information-aware optimization and MLP block reweighting, the paper demonstrates that small models can successfully leverage the knowledge of large, strong pretrained models.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from pretrained visual representation models offers an
effective approach to improve small, task-specific production models. However,
the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer drops significantly when
distilling from strong models that are pretrained in a large scale. In this
paper, we address this challenge for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by
exploring methods to fine-tune them for more effective knowledge transfer.
Motivated by the connection between mutual information and distillation
effectiveness, we propose to employ mutual information-aware optimization
during finetuning. For small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets where
such optimization becomes less effective, we introduce a simple yet effective
heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks. This approach is inspired by our
observation that top MLP blocks are primarily responsible for mutual
information loss. Our method enables small student models to benefit from those
pretrained models among the strongest.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) continue to face safety-critical risks due
to the inherent limitations in their design and performance capabilities.
Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the
runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions
enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into
acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based
constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack
generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in
ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently
but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we
propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method
that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed
tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.
Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint
heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving
environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate
adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety
identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse
annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and
others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to
mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat
conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT
using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate
more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation
results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.

Abstract: Privacy preservation in AI is crucial, especially in healthcare, where models
rely on sensitive patient data. In the emerging field of machine unlearning,
existing methodologies struggle to remove patient data from trained multimodal
architectures, which are widely used in healthcare. We propose Forget-MI, a
novel machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, by establishing
loss functions and perturbation techniques. Our approach unlearns unimodal and
joint representations of the data requested to be forgotten while preserving
knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining comparable performance to the
original model. We evaluate our results using performance on the forget
dataset, performance on the test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack
(MIA), which measures the attacker's ability to distinguish the forget dataset
from the training dataset. Our model outperforms the existing approaches that
aim to reduce MIA and the performance on the forget dataset while keeping an
equivalent performance on the test set. Specifically, our approach reduces MIA
by 0.202 and decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305,
respectively. Additionally, our performance on the test set matches that of the
retrained model, while allowing forgetting. Code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving
maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour. This not only
serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but
also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well
as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In
this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application
of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer,
preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive
models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the
field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive
models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for
python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the
required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The
maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary
functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready
to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of
the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons
recorded via smartphone sensors.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to compute representations of
node pairs for downstream tasks such as link prediction. Yet, theoretical
understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on
graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and
provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link
representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$
framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables
formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy
of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future
architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation
protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess
link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in
practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of
distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on
standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry
increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The paper proposes a statistical learning approach to the problem of
estimating missing pixels of images, crucial for image inpainting and
super-resolution problems. One of the main novelties of the method is that it
also provides uncertainty quantifications together with the estimated values.
Our core assumption is that the underlying data-generating function comes from
a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A special emphasis is put on
band-limited functions, central to signal processing, which form Paley-Wiener
type RKHSs. The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel
Interpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed
kernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing
pixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved
values, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also
show how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss
a generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of
numerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated
and benchmark images, as well.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the domain gap between synthetic and real data, which hinders the performance of ANNs in real-world applications.

Method: The study analyzes two mixing strategies on three architectures using three hybrid datasets, testing different synthetic-to-real data proportions.

Result: The results show that mixed training with hybrid datasets can mitigate the domain gap, but systematic evaluation across tasks and architectures is still needed.

Conclusion: The paper contributes insights for optimizing synthetic data use in ANN training to improve robustness and efficacy.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for
training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between
synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor
performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world
scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which
combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets.
While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic
evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and
architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study
comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent
architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we
sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to
investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this
paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in
the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and
efficacy.

Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including
in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties
such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known
to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist
other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can
consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited
prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly
distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.
Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads
to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by
$h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training
dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the
approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our
analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent
Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including
transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further
provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and
function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct
comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,
including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by
maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves
comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets. Code and

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them
requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent
these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated
images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a
valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when
these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable
detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable
in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.
We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion
models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing
watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are
either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the
noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,
despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and
efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To
overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for
IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in
large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our
extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in
preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and
preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.

Motivation: Recent SSL research has focused on complex consistency regularization or entropy minimization methods, but this work aims to simplify training strategies by explicitly using clustering assumptions.

Method: The method extends a differentiable clustering module, using annotated data to guide cluster centroids for an end-to-end trainable SSL approach.

Result: The proposed model outperforms supervised-only baselines and can enhance other SSL methods when used together.

Conclusion: The framework provides a simpler SSL approach by leveraging clustering assumptions, offering potential for integration with existing SSL techniques.

Abstract: The development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) has in recent years largely
focused on the development of new consistency regularization or entropy
minimization approaches, often resulting in models with complex training
strategies to obtain the desired results. In this work, we instead propose a
novel approach that explicitly incorporates the underlying clustering
assumption in SSL through extending a recently proposed differentiable
clustering module. Leveraging annotated data to guide the cluster centroids
results in a simple end-to-end trainable deep SSL approach. We demonstrate that
the proposed model improves the performance over the supervised-only baseline
and show that our framework can be used in conjunction with other SSL methods
to further boost their performance.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for
enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during
inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA
researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of
baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental
settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons
between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To
address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7
online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates
them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on
CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid
loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA
to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates
various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,
out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic
assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)
existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering
work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time
fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced
model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and
comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the
community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Abstract: Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs,
which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense
and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing
time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain
limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual
intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this
paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms
raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than
using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities
directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared
semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer
and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate
selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the
most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments
on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal
baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing
time series forecasting. Code is available at:

cross-layer integration, quantum-enabled communication, and ethical governance
frameworks for future AGI-enabled IoX systems. Finally, the survey identifies
unresolved challenges, such as computational requirements, scalability, and
real-world validation, calling for further research to fully realize AGI's

Motivation: To improve the performance of Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO) by learning optimal cell offset tuning through offline RL, which offers operational flexibility and better results than rule-based approaches.

Method: Applied Decision Transformers (sequence-based) and Conservative Q-Learning (value-based) to learn optimal policies leveraging offline datasets, using the same input features as traditional MRO.

Result: Offline-RL methods achieved up to 7% improvement in realistic NR networks compared to rule-based MRO, and can be adapted for diverse objective functions with the same dataset.

Conclusion: Offline RL is effective for MRO optimization, providing superior performance and flexibility over conventional rule-based methods.

Abstract: In this work we revisit the Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO) algorithm

using offline Reinforcement Learning. Such methods make use of collected
offline datasets to learn the optimal policy, without further exploration. We
adapt and apply a sequence-based method called Decision Transformers as well as
a value-based method called Conservative Q-Learning to learn the optimal policy
for the same target reward as the vanilla rule-based MRO. The same input
features related to failures, ping-pongs, and other handover issues are used.
Evaluation for realistic New Radio networks with 3500 MHz carrier frequency on
a traffic mix including diverse user service types and a specific tunable

Abstract: In the financial industry, data is the lifeblood of operations, and DBAs
shoulder significant responsibilities for SQL tuning, database deployment,

customers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an
effort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous

single-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual

GaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based

comprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit
abnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire
maintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of
metrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes,
and invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully
implemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry,
where it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance
scenarios. In this paper, we present significant improvements in these tasks

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the practical issue of adaptive algorithm termination in stochastic optimization, which existing methods don't handle well.

Method: The method involves developing a Gr"onwall-type argument adapted to stochastic processes for convergence analysis.

Result: The result is a novel convergence analysis that breaks a logarithmic barrier and provides sharper bounds without restrictive assumptions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the developed Gr"onwall-type argument enables more accurate and practical convergence analysis for stochastic optimization algorithms.

Abstract: This work provides a novel convergence analysis for stochastic optimization
in terms of stopping times, addressing the practical reality that algorithms
are often terminated adaptively based on observed progress. Unlike prior
approaches, our analysis: 1. Directly characterizes convergence in terms of
stopping times adapted to the underlying stochastic process. 2. Breaks a
logarithmic barrier in existing results. Key to our results is the development
of a Gr\"onwall-type argument tailored to such stochastic processes. This tool
enables sharper bounds without restrictive assumptions.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Hindsight-Guided Momentum (HGM), a first-order optimization
algorithm that adaptively scales learning rates based on the directional
consistency of recent updates. Traditional adaptive methods, such as Adam or
RMSprop , adapt learning dynamics using only the magnitude of gradients, often
overlooking important geometric cues.Geometric cues refer to directional
information, such as the alignment between current gradients and past updates,
which reflects the local curvature and consistency of the optimization path.
HGM addresses this by incorporating a hindsight mechanism that evaluates the
cosine similarity between the current gradient and accumulated momentum. This
allows it to distinguish between coherent and conflicting gradient directions,
increasing the learning rate when updates align and reducing it in regions of
oscillation or noise. The result is a more responsive optimizer that
accelerates convergence in smooth regions of the loss surface while maintaining
stability in sharper or more erratic areas. Despite this added adaptability,
the method preserves the computational and memory efficiency of existing
optimizers.By more intelligently responding to the structure of the
optimization landscape, HGM provides a simple yet effective improvement over
existing approaches, particularly in non-convex settings like that of deep
neural network training.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Even with the recent theoretical advancements that dramatically reduced the
complexity of Integer Programming (IP), heuristics remain the dominant
problem-solvers for this difficult category. This study seeks to establish the
groundwork for Integer Evolution Strategies (IESs), a class of randomized
search heuristics inherently designed for continuous spaces. IESs already excel
in treating IP in practice, but accomplish it via discretization and by
applying sophisticated patches to their continuous operators, while
persistently using the $\ell_2$-norm as their operation pillar. We lay
foundations for discrete search, by adopting the $\ell_1$-norm, accounting for
the suitable step-size, and questioning alternative measures to quantify
correlations over the integer lattice. We focus on mutation distributions for
unbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate
discrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which
we show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down
to the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We
explore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose
a procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our
investigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which
consistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for
unbounded integer search. We link our theoretical perspective to empirical
evidence indicating that an IES with correlated DG mutations outperformed other
strategies over non-separable quadratic IP. We conclude that while the
replacement of the default TN distribution by the DG is theoretically justified
and practically beneficial, the truly crucial change lies in adopting the
$\ell_1$-norm over the $\ell_2$-norm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing diversity and convergence in multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) by considering decision maker preferences and avoiding solution clustering bias.

Method: The approach defines a Region of Interest (ROI) using a cone that represents the decision maker's preferences in the objective space and enhances dispersion in the decision space with a uniformity measure.

Result: Preliminary experiments show that the method generates solutions that effectively balance dispersion and concentration, reducing bias in the decision space.

Conclusion: Combining solution concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space improves solution quality and enhances the search for Pareto-optimal solutions.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) often require a trade-off
between conflicting objectives, maximizing diversity and convergence in the
objective space. This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP
solutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the
convergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a
Region of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's
preferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions
in the decision space using a uniformity measure. Combining solution
concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space
intensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution
diversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of
solutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific
region of the decision space. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method
enhances multi-objective optimization by generating solutions that effectively
balance dispersion and concentration, thereby mitigating bias in the decision
space.

Abstract: The handling of manifold-valued data, for instance, plays a central role in
color restoration tasks relying on circle- or sphere-valued color models, in
the study of rotational or directional information related to the special
orthogonal group, and in Gaussian image processing, where the pixel statistics
are interpreted as values on the hyperbolic sheet. Especially, to denoise these
kind of data, there have been proposed several generalizations of total
variation (TV) and Tikhonov-type denoising models incorporating the underlying
manifolds. Recently, a novel, numerically efficient denoising approach has been
introduced, where the data are embedded in an Euclidean ambient space, the
non-convex manifolds are encoded by a series of positive semi-definite,
fixed-rank matrices, and the rank constraint is relaxed to obtain a
convexification that can be solved using standard algorithms from convex
analysis. The aim of the present paper is to extent this approach to new kinds
of data like multi-binary and Stiefel-valued data. Multi-binary data can, for
instance, be used to model multi-color QR codes whereas Stiefel-valued data
occur in image and video-based recognition. For both new data types, we propose
TV- and Tikhonov-based denoising modelstogether with easy-to-solve
convexification. All derived methods are evaluated on proof-of-concept,
synthetic experiments.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly playing key roles as support platforms for
human operators in high-risk, dangerous applications. To accomplish challenging
tasks, an efficient human-robot cooperation and understanding is required.
While typically robotic planning leverages 3D geometric information, human
operators are accustomed to a high-level compact representation of the
environment, like top-down 2D maps representing the Building Information Model
(BIM). 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge the gap
between human readable 2D BIM and the robot 3D maps. In this work, we introduce
Pixels-to-Graph (Pix2G), a novel lightweight method to generate structured
scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps in real-time for the autonomous
exploration of unknown environments on resource-constrained robot platforms. To
satisfy onboard compute constraints, the framework is designed to perform all
operation on CPU only. The method output are a de-noised 2D top-down
environment map and a structure-segmented 3D pointcloud which are seamlessly
connected using a multi-layer graph abstracting information from object-level
up to the building-level. The proposed method is quantitatively and
qualitatively evaluated during real-world experiments performed using the NASA
JPL NeBula-Spot legged robot to autonomously explore and map cluttered garage

Motivation: The motivation is to develop decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems that can operate safely in complex environments, addressing the limitations of current RL approaches in terms of generalizability and learning efficiency.

Method: The method involves a scenario-based environment combined with hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), where a high-level policy selects maneuver templates and a low-level control logic executes them, allowing controlled training experiences and inclusion of challenging scenarios.

Result: The agent trained with SAD-RL demonstrates safe behavior in both easy and challenging situations efficiently, with ablation studies showing HRL and scenario diversity are crucial for these results.

Conclusion: SAD-RL is presented as the first framework integrating HRL in a scenario-based environment for automated driving, highlighting the importance of hierarchical policies and diverse scenarios for effective and safe decision-making.

Abstract: Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems
remains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and
complex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn
comprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show
promising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to
achieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning
efficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving
Reinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates
Reinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based
environment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated
and executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment
allows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly
introduce challenging, but rate situations into the training process. Our
experiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve
safe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our
ablation studies confirmed that both HRL and scenario diversity are essential
for achieving these results.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that
account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human
behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most
likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing
methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often
overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally,
traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and
do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none
of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we
propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint
trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce
metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the
sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory
prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When
looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves
closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable
to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode
becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new
insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction
models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems
operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot
relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like
cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high
computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint
environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel
distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull
of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ
co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware
multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based
alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI
field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are
utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative
localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations
with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with
limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi
RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or
offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed
MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,
comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase
that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and
computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS package

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen
significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However,
most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,
assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded
environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to
keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As
a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective
escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement
dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must
continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process
and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing
dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of
escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where
other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to
identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting
their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification
and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network
architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust
its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume
escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong
baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,
showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in
complex, real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot
manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and
failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications
often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a
capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions
reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,
weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical
constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being
closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue
that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded
understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of
core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability
perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,
comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1
to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,
and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.
  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to
grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their
suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for
targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for
rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of
more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework, DriveBLIP2, built upon the BLIP2-OPT

To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight
significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames.
By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention
map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better
understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations.
Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation
quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD)
and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy
structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle
control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in
network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals
cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore,
we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our
approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL
policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and
short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is
explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving
behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state
updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure
multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based
highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly
improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action
consistency and safety.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal
inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While
proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle
avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising
degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the
underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions
of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.
To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that
bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using
Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout
proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of
states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances
robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and
deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate
the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage
proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms
the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed
to address distributional shifts.

Abstract: Realistic and interactive traffic simulation is essential for training and

populations. We propose InfGen, a scenario generation framework that outputs
agent states and trajectories in an autoregressive manner. InfGen represents
the entire scene as a sequence of tokens, including traffic light signals,
agent states, and motion vectors, and uses a transformer model to simulate
traffic over time. This design enables InfGen to continuously insert new agents
into traffic, supporting infinite scene generation. Experiments demonstrate
that InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors.
Furthermore, reinforcement learning policies trained in InfGen-generated
scenarios achieve superior robustness and generalization, validating its
utility as a high-fidelity simulation environment for autonomous driving. More

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning has emerged as a communication-efficient and
privacy-preserving paradigm for adapting large vision-language models like CLIP
across decentralized clients. However, the security implications of this setup
remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first study of backdoor
attacks in Federated Prompt Learning. We show that when malicious clients
inject visually imperceptible, learnable noise triggers into input images, the
global prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while
still maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this
vulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters
poisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained
offline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client
data or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets. We show, both
theoretically and empirically, that malicious clients can be reliably
identified and filtered using an embedding-based detector. Across five diverse
datasets and four baseline defenses, SABRE-FL outperforms all baselines by
significantly reducing backdoor accuracy while preserving clean accuracy,
demonstrating strong empirical performance and underscoring the need for robust
prompt learning in future federated systems.

Method: The study uses GPT-4o-mini with few-shot ICL on real-world French phishing emails from SignalSpam to classify them into 40 manipulation techniques.

Result: The approach achieved a promising accuracy of 0.76 in identifying prevalent phishing techniques like Baiting, Curiosity Appeal, and Request For Minor Favor.

Conclusion: The work shows that ICL can be effective for detailed phishing analysis and offers insights into how attackers use psychological tactics.

Abstract: Traditional phishing detection often overlooks psychological manipulation.
This study investigates using Large Language Model (LLM) In-Context Learning

40 manipulation techniques. Using few-shot examples with GPT-4o-mini on
real-world French phishing emails (SignalSpam), we evaluated performance
against a human-annotated test set (100 emails). The approach effectively
identifies prevalent techniques (e.g., Baiting, Curiosity Appeal, Request For
Minor Favor) with a promising accuracy of 0.76. This work demonstrates ICL's
potential for nuanced phishing analysis and provides insights into attacker

*Anamika Lochab,Lu Yan,Patrick Pynadath,Xiangyu Zhang,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces VERA, a variational inference framework for black-box jailbreak prompting that trains a small attacker LLM to approximate the target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts, enabling the generation of diverse and fluent jailbreak prompts without re-optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in real-world settings with API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs.

Method: VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts.

Result: VERA achieves strong performance across a range of target LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that VERA provides a comprehensive characterization of model vulnerabilities by generating diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts without requiring re-optimization for each prompt.

Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for
effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in
real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based
optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are
limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt
pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each
prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence
fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a
variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the
target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can
generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without
re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong
performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of
probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.

*Arun Ramamurthy,Neil Dhir*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of existing autonomous cybersecurity defense (ACD) systems by proposing general ACD (GACD) to learn policies adaptable to dynamic network environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ACD systems assume stationary network dynamics, which fails in real-world scenarios where network topologies change due to various factors, leading to poor adaptive capabilities and generalization issues.

Method: The paper explores methods for developing agents that can learn generalizable policies across dynamic network environments.

Result: The proposed GACD approach aims to improve the adaptability and generalization of defense agents in non-stationary network conditions.

Conclusion: By addressing the challenges of dynamic network environments, GACD enhances the effectiveness of autonomous cybersecurity defense systems.

Abstract: In the face of evolving cyber threats such as malware, ransomware and
phishing, autonomous cybersecurity defense (ACD) systems have become essential
for real-time threat detection and response with optional human intervention.
However, existing ACD systems rely on limiting assumptions, particularly the
stationarity of the underlying network dynamics. In real-world scenarios,
network topologies can change due to actions taken by attackers or defenders,
system failures, or time evolution of networks, leading to failures in the
adaptive capabilities of current defense agents. Moreover, many agents are
trained on static environments, resulting in overfitting to specific
topologies, which hampers their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution
network topologies. This work addresses these challenges by exploring methods
for developing agents to learn generalizable policies across dynamic network
environments -- general ACD (GACD).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable
of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks.
UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have
to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them
simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial
input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in
backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign
sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference.
The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of
its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be
fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due
to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation
trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation
to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are
subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness
have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and
audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model
architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks,
including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to
SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED
(IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently
demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's
strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of
attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.

*Tung-Ling Li,Hongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces logit-gap steering, a fast jailbreak method that uses a single vocabulary pass to reduce refusal-affirmation gaps in RLHF models, achieving high success rates with minimal model calls and revealing alignment artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more efficient jailbreak framework for language models that can quickly generate effective attacks with fewer computational resources.

Method: Logit-gap steering involves creating a forward-computable score that combines gap reduction with lightweight proxies for KL penalty and reward shift, using a 'sort-sum-stop' sweep to generate a short suffix.

Result: The method achieves 80-100% one-shot attack success rates, significantly higher than baseline levels, with the same suffix working across different prompts and model sizes from 0.5 B to 70 B.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that logit-gap steering is an efficient and effective jailbreak method that not only improves attack success rates but also provides insights into how safety tuning affects model representations.

Abstract: We introduce logit-gap steering, a fast jailbreak framework that casts the
refusal-affirmation gap of RLHF-aligned language models as a single pass over
the vocabulary. A forward-computable score blends gap reduction with
lightweight proxies for KL penalty and reward shift, allowing a "sort-sum-stop"
sweep to complete in under a second and return a short suffix--two orders of
magnitude fewer model calls than beam or gradient attacks. The same suffix
generalises to unseen prompts and scales from 0.5 B to 70 B checkpoints,
lifting one-shot attack success from baseline levels to 80-100% while
preserving topical coherence. Beyond efficiency, these suffixes expose
sentence-boundary reward cliffs and other alignment artefacts, offering a
lightweight probe into how safety tuning reshapes internal representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cybersecurity faces challenges in eliminating DDoS attacks, and automation with AI is difficult due to class imbalance and lack of labeled data.

Method: Evaluated 13 state-of-the-art SSL algorithms for DDoS detection in various scenarios.

Result: Results provide insights into creating robust IDSs that handle class imbalance and partially labeled data.

Conclusion: SSL techniques can improve DDoS detection in challenging data conditions.

Abstract: One of the most difficult challenges in cybersecurity is eliminating
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Automating this task using
artificial intelligence is a complex process due to the inherent class
imbalance and lack of sufficient labeled samples of real-world datasets. This
research investigates the use of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to
improve DDoS attack detection when data is imbalanced and partially labeled. In
this process, 13 state-of-the-art SSL algorithms are evaluated for detecting
DDoS attacks in several scenarios. We evaluate their practical efficacy and
shortcomings, including the extent to which they work in extreme environments.
The results will offer insight into designing intelligent Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDSs) that are robust against class imbalance and handle partially
labeled data.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with structured
function-calling interfaces have dramatically expanded capabilities for
real-time data retrieval, complex computation, and multi-step orchestration.
Yet, the explosive proliferation of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent
protocols has outpaced discovery mechanisms and security practices, resulting
in brittle integrations vulnerable to diverse threats. In this survey, we
introduce the first unified, end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems,
spanning host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications, formalize adversary
capabilities and attacker objectives, and catalog over thirty attack
techniques. Specifically, we organized the threat model into four domains:
Input Manipulation (e.g., prompt injections, long-context hijacks, multimodal
adversarial inputs), Model Compromise (e.g., prompt- and parameter-level
backdoors, composite and encrypted multi-backdoors, poisoning strategies),
System and Privacy Attacks (e.g., speculative side-channels, membership
inference, retrieval poisoning, social-engineering simulations), and Protocol
Vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent
Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) protocol). For each category, we review representative scenarios, assess
real-world feasibility, and evaluate existing defenses. Building on our threat
taxonomy, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, such
as securing MCP deployments through dynamic trust management and cryptographic
provenance tracking; designing and hardening Agentic Web Interfaces; and
achieving resilience in multi-agent and federated environments. Our work
provides a comprehensive reference to guide the design of robust defense
mechanisms and establish best practices for resilient LLM-agent workflows.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Malware detection in Android systems requires both cybersecurity expertise
and machine learning (ML) techniques. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has
emerged as an approach to simplify ML development by reducing the need for
specialized knowledge. However, current AutoML solutions typically operate as
black-box systems with limited transparency, interpretability, and experiment
traceability. To address these limitations, we present MH-AutoML, a
domain-specific framework for Android malware detection. MH-AutoML automates
the entire ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering,
algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The framework incorporates
capabilities for interpretability, debugging, and experiment tracking that are
often missing in general-purpose solutions. In this study, we compare MH-AutoML
against seven established AutoML frameworks: Auto-Sklearn, AutoGluon, TPOT,
HyperGBM, Auto-PyTorch, LightAutoML, and MLJAR. Results show that MH-AutoML
achieves better recall rates while providing more transparency and control. The
framework maintains computational efficiency comparable to other solutions,
making it suitable for cybersecurity applications where both performance and
explainability matter.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lifecycle-centric framework to analyze semantic privacy risks in LLMs across various stages and identifies gaps in current defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data privacy measures are insufficient for protecting implicit, contextual, or inferable information in LLMs deployed in sensitive domains.

Method: The paper presents a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) approach to categorize attack vectors and assess existing defenses like differential privacy and embedding encryption.

Result: The analysis shows critical gaps in semantic-level protection, particularly against contextual inference and latent representation leakage.

Conclusion: The paper outlines open challenges for future research, such as quantifying semantic leakage and balancing de-identification with generation quality, to develop robust privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting
information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as
semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a
lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across
input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We
categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as
differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning,
address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level
protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation
leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying
semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification
with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This
work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware
privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.

*Youjeong Noh,Joon-Young Paik,Jingun Kwon,Eun-Sun Cho*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a truth table-based approach and a guided MBA deobfuscation framework (gMBA) to enhance the analysis and deobfuscation of mixed Boolean-arithmetic obfuscation in malware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malware developers are using MBA obfuscation to evade detection, and traditional methods fail to exploit the internal semantics of these expressions, creating a need for more effective deobfuscation techniques.

Method: The paper proposes a truth table as a semantic representation of MBA expressions and modifies a Transformer-based Seq2Seq model into a guided deobfuscation framework (gMBA) to incorporate this semantic information.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that integrating expression semantics into the deobfuscation process significantly improves performance, making it more effective in recovering obfuscated code.

Conclusion: The study concludes that leveraging internal semantic information is crucial for effective MBA deobfuscation, and the proposed gMBA framework shows promising results in overcoming current limitations.

Abstract: Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) obfuscation protects intellectual property by
converting programs into forms that are more complex to analyze. However, MBA
has been increasingly exploited by malware developers to evade detection and
cause significant real-world problems. Traditional MBA deobfuscation methods
often consider these expressions as part of a black box and overlook their
internal semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose a truth table,
which is an automatically constructed semantic representation of an
expression's behavior that does not rely on external resources. The truth table
is a mathematical form that represents the output of expression for all
possible combinations of input. We also propose a general and extensible guided
MBA deobfuscation framework (gMBA) that modifies a Transformer-based neural
encoder-decoder Seq2Seq architecture to incorporate this semantic guidance.
Experimental results and in-depth analysis show that integrating expression
semantics significantly improves performance and highlights the importance of
internal semantic expressions in recovering obfuscated code to its original
form.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The analysis of the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs is an
area of research that has received strong interest from academics, industry,
and regulators. Despite this interest, the empirical study of these methods is
hindered by the lack of publicly available data. Reliable empirical analysis of
the privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset
consisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the
general release of such data to the public.
  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API
outputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and
provide strong privacy protections. We focus on one Privacy-Preserving Ads
APIs: the Topics API, part of Google Chrome's Privacy Sandbox. We developed a
methodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches
the re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of
differential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of
private user information from this release.
  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of
differentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over
time. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces
and optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained.
Finally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.
  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset
obtained by this methodology. We hope this will enable external researchers to
analyze the API in-depth and replicate prior and future work on a realistic
large-scale dataset. We believe that this work will contribute to fostering
transparency regarding the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify the conjecture about linear binomials in the vanishing ideal of undirected colored cycles and understand their relation to graph symmetries.

Method: Proving the conjecture for specific cycle lengths (3,5,7) and constructing counterexamples for other lengths by analyzing determinant equality of concentration matrices of colored paths.

Result: Conjecture holds for 3,5,7 cycles; disproven for other lengths. Determinant equality of concentration matrices of colored paths can occur without the paths being identical or reflections.

Conclusion: The original conjecture is partially valid, but a revised version is proposed to better capture the relationship between linear binomials and graph symmetries.

Abstract: A colored Gaussian graphical model is a linear concentration model in which
equalities among the concentrations are specified by a coloring of an
underlying graph. Marigliano and Davies conjectured that every linear binomial
that appears in the vanishing ideal of an undirected colored cycle corresponds
to a graph symmetry. We prove this conjecture for 3,5, and 7 cycles and
disprove it for colored cycles of any other length. We construct the
counterexamples by proving the fact that the determinant of the concentration
matrices of two colored paths can be equal even when they are not identical or
reflection of each other. We also explore the potential strengthening of the
conjecture and prove a revised version of the conjecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural rendering methods like NeRFs and 3DGS require preprocessed camera poses and 3D structural priors from SfM, which are hard to get in outdoor settings. The goal is to improve camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction in such challenging environments.

Method: The paper integrates ICP with optimization-based refinement for accurate camera pose estimation during large movements. It also presents a voxel-based scene densification method to enhance reconstruction in large-scale scenes.

Result: Experiments show ICP-3DGS outperforms existing methods in camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis across different indoor and outdoor scene scales.

Conclusion: The proposed ICP-3DGS approach effectively improves neural rendering in outdoor scenarios by addressing the limitations of camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction without relying on SfM.

Abstract: In recent years, neural rendering methods such as NeRFs and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in scene reconstruction and
novel view synthesis. However, they heavily rely on preprocessed camera poses
and 3D structural priors from structure-from-motion (SfM), which are
challenging to obtain in outdoor scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose to incorporate Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with optimization-based
refinement to achieve accurate camera pose estimation under large camera
movements. Additionally, we introduce a voxel-based scene densification
approach to guide the reconstruction in large-scale scenes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach ICP-3DGS outperforms existing methods in both

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become horsepower in high-quality, real-time
rendering for novel view synthesis of 3D scenes. However, existing methods
focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene
understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the
originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we
propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates
Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized
for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We
then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets
construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth
distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For
open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D
point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with
high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D
instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object
localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies. Our code is

Result: Demonstrates better compression-fidelity trade-offs than previous methods, with average confidence as a new quality metric.

Conclusion: The approach is architecture-agnostic and applicable to any Gaussian Splatting variant, with code and data available publicly.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables high-quality real-time rendering but often

optimized through reconstruction-aware losses, enabling pruning of
low-confidence splats while preserving visual fidelity. The proposed approach
is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any Gaussian Splatting variant.
In addition, the average confidence values serve as a new metric to assess the

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images
conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful
guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a
widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale,
which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the
guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually
appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing
guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based
on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method
addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that
our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with
the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.
Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory
consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,
offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.

Abstract: Video stabilization is pivotal for video processing, as it removes unwanted
shakiness while preserving the original user motion intent. Existing
approaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues
(e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that
degrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce
\textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video
stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering'
paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict
Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view
dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to
produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to
render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid
frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with
3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene
dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to
state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics
and new geometry consistency. Qualitatively, our method produces noticeably
better results compared to alternatives, validated by the user study.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study examines the impact of an Artificial Intelligence tutor teammate
(AI) on student curiosity-driven engagement and learning effectiveness during
Interactive Molecular Dynamics (IMD) tasks on the Visual Molecular Dynamics
platform. It explores the role of the AI's curiosity-triggering and response
behaviors in stimulating and sustaining student curiosity, affecting the
frequency and complexity of student-initiated questions. The study further
assesses how AI interventions shape student engagement, foster discovery
curiosity, and enhance team performance within the IMD learning environment.
Using a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm, a human experimenter dynamically adjusts the AI
tutor teammate's behavior through a large language model. By employing a
mixed-methods exploratory design, a total of 11 high school students
participated in four IMD tasks that involved molecular visualization and
calculations, which increased in complexity over a 60-minute period. Team
performance was evaluated through real-time observation and recordings, whereas
team communication was measured by question complexity and AI's
curiosity-triggering and response behaviors. Cross Recurrence Quantification
Analysis (CRQA) metrics reflected structural alignment in coordination and were
linked to communication behaviors. High-performing teams exhibited superior
task completion, deeper understanding, and increased engagement. Advanced
questions were associated with AI curiosity-triggering, indicating heightened
engagement and cognitive complexity. CRQA metrics highlighted dynamic
synchronization in student-AI interactions, emphasizing structured yet adaptive
engagement to promote curiosity. These proof-of-concept findings suggest that
the AI's dual role as a teammate and educator indicates its capacity to provide
adaptive feedback, sustaining engagement and epistemic curiosity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Access to accurate and actionable harm reduction information can directly
impact the health outcomes of People Who Use Drugs (PWUD), yet existing online
channels often fail to meet their diverse and dynamic needs due to limitations
in adaptability, accessibility, and the pervasive impact of stigma. Large
Language Models (LLMs) present a novel opportunity to enhance information
provision, but their application in such a high-stakes domain is under-explored
and presents socio-technical challenges. This paper investigates how LLMs can
be responsibly designed to support the information needs of PWUD. Through a
qualitative workshop involving diverse stakeholder groups (academics, harm
reduction practitioners, and an online community moderator), we explored LLM
capabilities, identified potential use cases, and delineated core design
considerations. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can address some existing
information barriers (e.g., by offering responsive, multilingual, and
potentially less stigmatising interactions), their effectiveness is contingent
upon overcoming challenges related to ethical alignment with harm reduction
principles, nuanced contextual understanding, effective communication, and
clearly defined operational boundaries. We articulate design pathways
emphasising collaborative co-design with experts and PWUD to develop LLM
systems that are helpful, safe, and responsibly governed. This work contributes
empirically grounded insights and actionable design considerations for the
responsible development of LLMs as supportive tools within the harm reduction
ecosystem.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AI is flattening culture. Evaluations of "culture" are showing the myriad
ways in which large AI models are homogenizing language and culture, averaging
out rich linguistic differences into generic expressions. I call this
phenomenon "softmaxing culture," and it is one of the fundamental challenges
facing AI evaluations today. Efforts to improve and strengthen evaluations of
culture are central to the project of cultural alignment in large AI systems.
This position paper argues that machine learning (ML) and human-computer
interaction (HCI) approaches to evaluation are limited. I propose two key
shifts. First, instead of asking "what is culture?" at the start of system
evaluations, I propose beginning with the question: "when is culture?" Second,
while I acknowledge the philosophical claim that cultural universals exist, the
challenge is not simply to describe them, but to situate them in relation to
their particulars. Taken together, these conceptual shifts invite evaluation
approaches that move beyond technical requirements, toward perspectives more
responsive to the complexities of culture.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Interactive Reasoning, a method to visualize and allow user modification of chain-of-thought outputs in LLMs, improving their usability and customizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of verbose and unorganized chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs in LLMs, which hinder user review and feedback.

Method: The method involves designing an interaction framework called Interactive Reasoning, implemented in Hippo, which organizes CoT outputs hierarchically and allows user review and modification.

Result: The user study with 16 participants showed that Interactive Reasoning helps users quickly detect errors, steer the model for tailored responses, and understand model reasoning and outputs better.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that incorporating user oversight into LLM reasoning processes through Interactive Reasoning represents a new paradigm for improving AI-assisted decision-making under uncertain trade-offs.

Abstract: The output quality of large language models (LLMs) can be improved via
"reasoning": generating segments of chain-of-thought (CoT) content to further
condition the model prior to producing user-facing output. While these chains
contain valuable information, they are verbose and lack explicit organization,
making them tedious to review. Moreover, they lack opportunities for user
feedback, such as to remove unwanted considerations, add desired ones, or
clarify unclear assumptions. We introduce Interactive Reasoning, an interaction
design that visualizes chain-of-thought outputs as a hierarchy of topics and
enables user review and modification. We implement interactive reasoning in
Hippo, a prototype for AI-assisted decision making in the face of uncertain
trade-offs. In a user study with 16 participants, we find that interactive
reasoning in Hippo allows users to quickly identify and interrupt erroneous
generations, efficiently steer the model towards customized responses, and
better understand both model reasoning and model outputs. Our work contributes
to a new paradigm that incorporates user oversight into LLM reasoning
processes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large
Language Models (LLM), on education is continuously increasing. These models
are frequently used by students, giving rise to the question whether current
forms of assessment are still a valid way to evaluate student performance and
comprehension. The theoretical framework developed in this paper is grounded in
Constructive Alignment (CA) theory and Bloom's taxonomy for defining learning
objectives. We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom
levels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly.
Furthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment
should be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.
  Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be
adapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which
lecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a
lecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves.
To avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty
level, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that
teaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI
tools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods.

Abstract: The global prevalence of dementia is projected to double by 2050,
highlighting the urgent need for scalable diagnostic tools. This study utilizes
digital cognitive tasks with eye-tracking data correlated with memory processes
to distinguish between Healthy Controls (HC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment
(MCI), a precursor to dementia. A deep learning model based on VTNet was
trained using eye-tracking data from 44 participants (24 MCI, 20 HCs) who
performed a visual memory task. The model utilizes both time series and spatial
data derived from eye-tracking. It was modified to incorporate scan paths, heat
maps, and image content. These modifications also enabled testing parameters
such as image resolution and task performance, analyzing their impact on model
performance. The best model, utilizing $700\times700px$ resolution heatmaps,
achieved 68% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Despite operating under more
challenging conditions (e.g., smaller dataset size, shorter task duration, or a
less standardized task), the model's performance is comparable to an
Alzheimer's study using similar methods (70% sensitivity and 73% specificity).
These findings contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for
MCI. Future work should focus on refining the model and using a standardized
long-term visual memory task.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of
professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has
examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on
domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within
defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI
decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy:
skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain)
and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant
values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing
empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we
demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential
for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both
immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for
autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical
design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of
defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help
maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This
framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance
rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced as a regularizing prior
for PET image reconstruction, integrating DMs trained on high-quality PET
images with unsupervised schemes that condition on measured data. While these
approaches have potential generalization advantages due to their independence
from the scanner geometry and the injected activity level, they forgo the
opportunity to explicitly model the interaction between the DM prior and noisy
measurement data, potentially limiting reconstruction accuracy. To address
this, we propose a supervised DM-based algorithm for PET reconstruction. Our
method enforces the non-negativity of PET's Poisson likelihood model and
accommodates the wide intensity range of PET images. Through experiments on
realistic brain PET phantoms, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods quantitatively across a
range of dose levels. We further conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
benefits of the proposed components in our model, as well as its dependence on
training data, parameter count, and number of diffusion steps. Additionally, we
show that our approach enables more accurate posterior sampling than
unsupervised DM-based methods, suggesting improved uncertainty estimation.
Finally, we extend our methodology to a practical approach for fully 3D PET and
present example results from real [$^{18}$F]FDG brain PET data.

Abstract: Human Digital Twins (HDTs) have traditionally been conceptualized as
data-driven models designed to support decision-making across various domains.
However, recent advancements in conversational AI open new possibilities for
HDTs to function as authentic, interactive digital counterparts of individuals.
This paper introduces a novel HDT system architecture that integrates large
language models with dynamically updated personal data, enabling it to mirror
an individual's conversational style, memories, and behaviors. To achieve this,
our approach implements context-aware memory retrieval, neural
plasticity-inspired consolidation, and adaptive learning mechanisms, creating a
more natural and evolving digital persona. The resulting system does not only
replicate an individual's unique conversational style depending on who they are
speaking with, but also enriches responses with dynamically captured personal
experiences, opinions, and memories. While this marks a significant step toward
developing authentic virtual counterparts, it also raises critical ethical
concerns regarding privacy, accountability, and the long-term implications of
persistent digital identities. This study contributes to the field of HDTs by
describing our novel system architecture, demonstrating its capabilities, and
discussing future directions and emerging challenges to ensure the responsible
and ethical development of HDTs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study investigates adaptive experimental design for treatment choice,
also known as fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive
procedure consisting of a treatment-allocation phase followed by a
treatment-choice phase, and we design an adaptive experiment for this setup to
efficiently identify the best treatment arm, defined as the one with the
highest expected outcome. In our designed experiment, the treatment-allocation
phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, where we
allocate each treatment arm uniformly with equal proportions to eliminate
clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, we
allocate treatment arms in proportion to the variances estimated in the first
stage. After the treatment-allocation phase, the procedure enters the
treatment-choice phase, where we choose the treatment arm with the highest
sample mean as our estimate of the best treatment arm. We prove that this
single design is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for
the simple regret, with upper bounds that match our lower bounds up to exact
constants. Therefore, our designed experiment achieves the sharp efficiency
limits without requiring separate tuning for minimax and Bayesian objectives.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present P4OMP, a retrieval-augmented framework for transforming serial
C/C++ code into OpenMP-annotated parallel code using large language models
(LLMs). To our knowledge, this is the first system to apply retrieval-based
prompting for OpenMP pragma correctness without model fine-tuning or compiler
instrumentation. P4OMP leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
structured instructional knowledge from OpenMP tutorials to improve the
reliability of prompt-driven code generation. By grounding generation in the
retrieved context, P4OMP improves syntactic correctness compared to baseline
prompting with GPT-3.5-Turbo. We evaluate P4OMP against a baseline,
GPT-3.5-Turbo without retrieval, on a comprehensive benchmark of 108 real-world
C++ programs drawn from Stack Overflow, PolyBench, and NAS benchmark suites.
P4OMP achieves 100% compilation success on all parallelizable cases, while the
baseline fails to compile in 20 out of 108 cases. Six cases that rely on
non-random-access iterators or thread-unsafe constructs are excluded due to
fundamental OpenMP limitations. A detailed analysis demonstrates how P4OMP
consistently avoids scoping errors, syntactic misuse, and invalid directive
combinations that commonly affect baseline-generated code. We further
demonstrate strong runtime scaling across seven compute-intensive benchmarks on
an HPC cluster. P4OMP offers a robust, modular pipeline that significantly
improves the reliability and applicability of LLM-generated OpenMP code.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as a mainstream method for compressing Large
Language Models (LLMs), reducing memory requirements and accelerating inference
without architectural modifications. While existing research primarily focuses
on evaluating the effectiveness of quantized LLMs compared to their original
counterparts, the impact on robustness remains largely unexplored.In this
paper, we present the first systematic investigation of how quantization
affects the robustness of LLMs in code generation tasks. Through extensive
experiments across four prominent LLM families (LLaMA, DeepSeek, CodeGen, and
StarCoder) with parameter scales ranging from 350M to 33B, we evaluate
robustness from dual perspectives: adversarial attacks on input prompts and
noise perturbations on model architecture. Our findings challenge conventional
wisdom by demonstrating that quantized LLMs often exhibit superior robustness
compared to their full-precision counterparts, with 51.59% versus 42.86% of our
adversarial experiments showing better resilience in quantized LLMs. Similarly,
our noise perturbation experiments also confirm that LLMs after quantitation
generally withstand higher levels of weight disturbances. These results suggest
that quantization not only reduces computational requirements but can actually
enhance LLMs' reliability in code generation tasks, providing valuable insights
for developing more robust and efficient LLM deployment strategies.

Motivation: Analysts and developers often neglect privacy as a security concept or afterthought, leading to non-compliance. Current methods focus on legal requirements extraction and compliance evaluation, but there's a need for better privacy requirement generation during software development.

Method: The paper proposes a method leveraging chain-of-thought prompting, in-context learning, and large language models to extract privacy behaviors from software documents and generate privacy requirements in user story format.

Result: Most popular LLMs like GPT-4o and Llama 3 can identify privacy behaviors and generate user stories with F1 scores over 0.8. Parameter tuning enhances model performance.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into effectively using and optimizing LLMs for generating privacy requirements from software documents across the development lifecycle.

Abstract: Research shows that analysts and developers consider privacy as a security
concept or as an afterthought, which may lead to non-compliance and violation
of users' privacy. Most current approaches, however, focus on extracting legal
requirements from the regulations and evaluating the compliance of software and
processes with them. In this paper, we develop a novel approach based on
chain-of-thought prompting (CoT), in-context-learning (ICL), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) to extract privacy behaviors from various software documents
prior to and during software development, and then generate privacy
requirements in the format of user stories. Our results show that most commonly
used LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama 3, can identify privacy behaviors and
generate privacy user stories with F1 scores exceeding 0.8. We also show that
the performance of these models could be improved through parameter-tuning. Our
findings provide insight into using and optimizing LLMs for generating privacy
requirements given software documents created prior to or throughout the
software development lifecycle.

deadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a
circular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures.
Despite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks
remains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first
dedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique,
STCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs
controlled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker
consists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and
Conflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable
black-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a
given scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation
collaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial
conflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive
behaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby
increasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We
evaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA,
a module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results
show that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing
baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum state tomography (QST) is essential for evaluating quantum devices, but standard methods become impractical due to exponential parameter growth.

Method: Parameterizing the quantum state using low-rank block tensor train decomposition.

Result: The approach is both memory- and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The framework is applicable to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by low-rank decompositions, such as pure states, nearly pure states, and ground states of Hamiltonians.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the
state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in
evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation
methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the
state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing
the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate
that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework
applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by
low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground

TL;DR: SQUASH is a circuit-level attack that uses SWAP gates to disrupt Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) for classification tasks, causing significant accuracy degradation without needing training data or introducing detectable perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in HQNNs by directly manipulating their circuit structure, which is a novel approach compared to existing noise-based or adversarial input attacks.

Method: SQUASH inserts SWAP gates into the variational quantum circuit of the victim HQNN, causing qubit misalignment and disrupting quantum state evolution.

Result: SQUASH reduces untargeted classification accuracy by up to 74.08% and target class accuracy by up to 79.78%, showing a critical vulnerability in HQNN implementations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that HQNNs have a critical vulnerability to circuit-level attacks like SQUASH, highlighting the need for more resilient architectures against such adversarial interventions.

Abstract: We propose a circuit-level attack, SQUASH, a SWAP-Based Quantum Attack to
sabotage Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) for classification tasks.
SQUASH is executed by inserting SWAP gate(s) into the variational quantum
circuit of the victim HQNN. Unlike conventional noise-based or adversarial
input attacks, SQUASH directly manipulates the circuit structure, leading to
qubit misalignment and disrupting quantum state evolution. This attack is
highly stealthy, as it does not require access to training data or introduce
detectable perturbations in input states. Our results demonstrate that SQUASH
significantly degrades classification performance, with untargeted SWAP attacks
reducing accuracy by up to 74.08\% and targeted SWAP attacks reducing target
class accuracy by up to 79.78\%. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability
in HQNN implementations, underscoring the need for more resilient architectures
against circuit-level adversarial interventions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical
language model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable
tool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-of-the-art
multilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating
the structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language
confusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents a
methodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in
any target language, using Bulgarian as a case study. The approach involves
continued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on a
novel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support
standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research
introduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to
28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while
preserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian
benchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate production-ready
response formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the
verbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation
framework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages.
This work demonstrates a practical approach for extending tool-augmented
capabilities beyond English-centric systems.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore a multi-modal approach to enhancing
live broadcast engagement by developing a short video recommendation system
that incorporates Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (MMGCN) with user
preferences. In order to provide personalized recommendations tailored to
individual interests, the proposed system takes into account user interaction
data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a
hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering
techniques, the system is able to capture nuanced relationships between users,
video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate
the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to
baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide & Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the
proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the
proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse
user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting
in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1
score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and
user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role
they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live
broadcast platforms.

experiences, primarily through recommendation systems that enhance customer
engagement through personalized suggestions. To improve customers' experience
in online shopping, we propose a novel comprehensive KiseKloset system for
outfit retrieval, recommendation, and try-on. We explore two approaches for
outfit retrieval: similar item retrieval and text feedback-guided item
retrieval. Notably, we introduce a novel transformer architecture designed to
recommend complementary items from diverse categories. Furthermore, we enhance
the overall performance of the search pipeline by integrating approximate
algorithms to optimize the search process. Additionally, addressing the crucial
needs of online shoppers, we employ a lightweight yet efficient virtual try-on
framework capable of real-time operation, memory efficiency, and maintaining
realistic outputs compared to its predecessors. This virtual try-on module
empowers users to visualize specific garments on themselves, enhancing the
customers' experience and reducing costs associated with damaged items for
retailers. We deployed our end-to-end system for online users to test and
provide feedback, enabling us to measure their satisfaction levels. The results
of our user study revealed that 84% of participants found our comprehensive
system highly useful, significantly improving their online shopping experience.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly the emergence of foundation
models, are leading to new opportunities to develop technology-based solutions
to societal problems. However, the reasoning and inner workings of today's
complex AI models are not transparent to the user, and there are no safety
guarantees regarding their predictions. Consequently, to fulfill the promise of
AI, we must address the following scientific challenge: how to develop AI-based
systems that are not only accurate and performant but also safe and
trustworthy?
  The criticality of safe operation is particularly evident for autonomous
systems for control and robotics, and was the catalyst for the Safe Learning
Enabled Systems (SLES) program at NSF. For the broader class of AI
applications, such as users interacting with chatbots and clinicians receiving
treatment recommendations, safety is, while no less important, less
well-defined with context-dependent interpretations. This motivated the
organization of a day-long workshop, held at University of Pennsylvania on
February 26, 2025, to bring together investigators funded by the NSF SLES
program with a broader pool of researchers studying AI safety. This report is
the result of the discussions in the working groups that addressed different
aspects of safety at the workshop. The report articulates a new research agenda
focused on developing theory, methods, and tools that will provide the
foundations of the next generation of AI-enabled systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic risk-taking behaviors
analogous to those observed in gambling psychology, including overconfidence
bias, loss-chasing tendencies, and probability misjudgment. Drawing from
behavioral economics and prospect theory, we identify and formalize these
"gambling-like" patterns where models sacrifice accuracy for high-reward
outputs, exhibit escalating risk-taking after errors, and systematically
miscalibrate uncertainty. We propose the Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG)
framework, incorporating insights from gambling research to address these
behavioral biases through risk-calibrated training, loss-aversion mechanisms,
and uncertainty-aware decision making. Our approach introduces novel evaluation
paradigms based on established gambling psychology experiments, including AI
adaptations of the Iowa Gambling Task and probability learning assessments.
Experimental results demonstrate measurable reductions in gambling-like
behaviors: 18.7\% decrease in overconfidence bias, 24.3\% reduction in
loss-chasing tendencies, and improved risk calibration across diverse
scenarios. This work establishes the first systematic framework for
understanding and mitigating gambling psychology patterns in AI systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AI for good initiatives often rely on the assumption that technical
interventions can resolve complex social problems. In the context of human
trafficking (HT), such techno-solutionism risks oversimplifying exploitation,
reinforcing power imbalances and causing harm to the very communities AI claims
to support. In this paper, we introduce the Radical Questioning (RQ) framework
as a five step, pre-project ethical assessment tool to critically evaluate
whether AI should be built at all, especially in domains involving marginalized
populations and entrenched systemic injustice. RQ does not replace principles
based ethics but precedes it, offering an upstream, deliberative space to
confront assumptions, map power, and consider harms before design. Using a case
study in AI for HT, we demonstrate how RQ reveals overlooked sociocultural
complexities and guides us away from surveillance based interventions toward
survivor empowerment tools. While developed in the context of HT, RQ's five
step structure can generalize to other domains, though the specific questions
must be contextual. This paper situates RQ within a broader AI ethics
philosophy that challenges instrumentalist norms and centers relational,
reflexive responsibility.

Abstract: This thesis explores the impact of the Climate Emergency movement on local
government climate policy, using computational methods. The Climate Emergency
movement sought to accelerate climate action at local government level through
the mechanism of Climate Emergency Declarations (CEDs), resulting in a series
of commitments from councils to treat climate change as an emergency. With the
aim of assessing the potential of current large language models to answer
complex policy questions, I first built and configured a system named PALLM
(Policy Analysis with a Large Language Model), using the OpenAI model GPT-4.
This system is designed to apply a conceptual framework for climate emergency
response plans to a dataset of climate policy documents. I validated the
performance of this system with the help of local government policymakers, by
generating analyses of the climate policies of 11 local governments in Victoria
and assessing the policymakers' level of agreement with PALLM's responses.
Having established that PALLM's performance is satisfactory, I used it to
conduct a large-scale analysis of current policy documents from local
governments in the state of Victoria, Australia. This thesis presents the
methodology and results of this analysis, comparing the results for councils
which have passed a CED to those which did not. This study finds that GPT-4 is
capable of high-level policy analysis, with limitations including a lack of
reliable attribution, and can also enable more nuanced analysis by researchers.
Its use in this research shows that councils which have passed a CED are more
likely to have a recent and climate-specific policy, and show more attention to
urgency, prioritisation, and equity and social justice, than councils which
have not. It concludes that the ability to assess policy documents at scale
opens up exciting new opportunities for policy researchers.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements in the field of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) have positioned commercialized language models as
wide-reaching, highly useful tools. In tandem, there has been an explosion of
multidisciplinary research examining how NLP tasks reflect, perpetuate, and
amplify social biases such as gender and racial bias. A significant gap in this
scholarship is a detailed analysis of how queer sexualities are encoded and
(mis)represented by both NLP systems and practitioners. Following previous work
in the field of AI fairness, we document how sexuality is defined and
operationalized via a survey and analysis of 55 articles that quantify
sexuality-based NLP bias. We find that sexuality is not clearly defined in a
majority of the literature surveyed, indicating a reliance on assumed or
normative conceptions of sexual/romantic practices and identities. Further, we
find that methods for extracting biased outputs from NLP technologies often
conflate gender and sexual identities, leading to monolithic conceptions of
queerness and thus improper quantifications of bias. With the goal of improving
sexuality-based NLP bias analyses, we conclude with recommendations that
encourage more thorough engagement with both queer communities and
interdisciplinary literature.

Motivation: To assess the reliability of Political Compass Test (PCT) and similar questionnaires in measuring LLMs' political leanings, especially considering how different factors might influence the results.

Method: Building on prior research about PCT validity, the study examines the impact of standard generation parameters, prompt variations, and fine-tuning on PCT scores.

Result: Variation in standard generation parameters doesn't significantly affect PCT scores, but prompt variations and fine-tuning do, either individually or combined.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for re-evaluating the validity of PCT and similar tests, and understanding how political leanings are encoded in LLMs.

Abstract: Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to
quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that
examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard
generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores.
However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning
individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that
when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than
others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a
thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as
the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs.

GPT4DFCI was able to identify copyrighted material and reproduce exact quotes
from famous books which indicates that copyrighted material was in the training
data. The model was not able to reproduce content from our target news article,
scientific article, or electronic health records. However, there were instances
of fabrication. As a result of this event, a mitigation strategy is in
production in GPT4DFCI v2.8.2, deployed on January 21, 2025. We hope this

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Causal inference is central to statistics and scientific discovery, enabling
researchers to identify cause-and-effect relationships beyond associations.
While traditionally studied within Euclidean spaces, contemporary applications
increasingly involve complex, non-Euclidean data structures that reside in
abstract metric spaces, known as random objects, such as images, shapes,
networks, and distributions. This paper introduces a novel framework for causal
inference with continuous treatments applied to non-Euclidean data. To address
the challenges posed by the lack of linear structures, we leverage Hilbert
space embeddings of the metric spaces to facilitate Fr\'echet mean estimation
and causal effect mapping. Motivated by a study on the impact of exposure to
fine particulate matter on age-at-death distributions across U.S. counties, we
propose a nonparametric, doubly-debiased causal inference approach for outcomes
as random objects with continuous treatments. Our framework can accommodate
moderately high-dimensional vector-valued confounders and derive efficient
influence functions for estimation to ensure both robustness and
interpretability. We establish rigorous asymptotic properties of the
cross-fitted estimators and employ conformal inference techniques for
counterfactual outcome prediction. Validated through numerical experiments and
applied to real-world environmental data, our framework extends causal
inference methodologies to complex data structures, broadening its
applicability across scientific disciplines.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce $\zeta$- and $s$-values as quantile-based standardizations that
are particularly suited for hypothesis testing. Unlike p-values, which express
tail probabilities, $s$-values measure the number of semi-tail units into a
distribution's tail, where each unit represents a halving of the tail area.
This logarithmic scale provides intuitive interpretation: $s=3.3$ corresponds
to the 10th percentile, $s=4.3$ to the 5th percentile, and $s=5.3$ to the 2.5th
percentile. For two-tailed tests, $\zeta$-values extend this concept
symmetrically around the median.
  We demonstrate how these measures unify the interpretation of all test
statistics on a common scale, eliminating the need for distribution-specific
tables. The approach offers practical advantages: critical values follow simple
arithmetic progressions, combining evidence from independent studies reduces to
the addition of $s$-values, and semi-tail units provide the natural scale for
expressing Bahadur slopes. This leads to a new asymptotic efficiency measure
based on differences rather than ratios of slopes, where a difference of 0.15
semi-tail units means that the more efficient test moves samples 10\% farther
into the tail. Through examples ranging from standardized test scores to poker
hand rankings, we show how semi-tail units provide a natural and interpretable
scale for quantifying extremeness in any ordered distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the sharpness of confidence sequences by using informative priors while ensuring they remain valid even if the prior is misspecified.

Method: Combining mixture methods with global informative priors (polynomial or exponential tails) and extended Ville's inequality to construct confidence sequences.

Result: Sharper confidence sequences when the prior is well-specified, but they remain bounded under arbitrary misspecification.

Conclusion: The approach balances the benefits of informative priors with robustness to prior misspecification, applicable to Gaussian observations with known variance.

Abstract: Confidence sequences are collections of confidence regions that
simultaneously cover the true parameter for every sample size at a prescribed
confidence level. Tightening these sequences is of practical interest and can
be achieved by incorporating prior information through the method of mixture
martingales. However, confidence sequences built from informative priors are
vulnerable to misspecification and may become vacuous when the prior is poorly
chosen. We study this trade-off for Gaussian observations with known variance.
By combining the method of mixtures with a global informative prior whose tails
are polynomial or exponential and the extended Ville's inequality, we construct
confidence sequences that are sharper than their non-informative counterparts
whenever the prior is well specified, yet remain bounded under arbitrary
misspecification. The theory is illustrated with several classical priors.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop methods for analyzing time-varying nonlinear regression in locally stationary time series with minimal assumptions and effective identifiability solutions.

Method: The method involves sieve nonparametric estimators, unified simultaneous inferential theory, and a multiplier bootstrap procedure for practical implementation.

Result: The results include uniform consistency of the estimators, Gaussian approximation for high-dimensional time series, and critical values for maxima of Gaussian random fields, supported by simulations and data analyses.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their methodology provides a flexible and robust approach for time-varying regression analysis with practical implementation through the SIMle R package.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate time-varying nonlinear time series regression
for a broad class of locally stationary time series. First, we propose sieve
nonparametric estimators for the time-varying regression functions that achieve
uniform consistency. Second, we develop a unified simultaneous inferential
theory to conduct both structural and exact form tests on these functions.
Additionally, we introduce a multiplier bootstrap procedure for practical
implementation. Our methodology and theory require only mild assumptions on the
regression functions, allow for unbounded domain support, and effectively
address the issue of identifiability for practical interpretation. Technically,
we establish sieve approximation theory for 2-D functions in unbounded domains,
prove two Gaussian approximation results for affine forms of high-dimensional
locally stationary time series, and calculate critical values for the maxima of
the Gaussian random field arising from locally stationary time series, which
may be of independent interest. Numerical simulations and two data analyses
support our results, and we have developed an $\mathtt{R}$ package,
$\mathtt{SIMle}$, to facilitate implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of standard dispersion measurement approaches, particularly the classical dispersive order, which is too restrictive for discrete random variables due to support inclusion requirements.

Method: The method involves proposing a novel weak dispersive order that relaxes structural constraints while maintaining desirable properties, and introducing a class of variability measures based on probability concentration.

Result: The result is a framework that provides robust and interpretable variability measures for discrete distributions, with empirical illustrations demonstrating its practical relevance.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed weak dispersive order and variability measures offer a broader applicability and improved alternatives to classical axioms in the context of discrete distributions.

Abstract: Dispersion is a fundamental concept in statistics, yet standard approaches to
measuring it - especially via stochastic orders - face limitations in the
discrete setting. In particular, the classical dispersive order, while
well-established for continuous distributions, becomes overly restrictive when
applied to discrete random variables due to support inclusion requirements. To
address this, we propose a novel weak dispersive order tailored for discrete
distributions. This order retains desirable properties while relaxing
structural constraints, thereby broadening applicability. We further introduce
a class of variability measures grounded in the notion of probability
concentration, offering robust and interpretable alternatives that conform to
classical axioms. Several empirical illustrations highlight the practical
relevance of the proposed framework.

### [490] [Upgrading survival models with CARE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23870)
*William G. Underwood,Henry W. J. Reeve,Oliver Y. Feng,Samuel A. Lambert,Bhramar Mukherjee,Richard J. Samworth*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARE, a method for combining existing risk models with new data in survival analysis, using convex combinations of kernel and external estimators. It provides theoretical guarantees and empirical validation in cardiovascular disease risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical risk prediction models need updating with new data and covariates, but existing methods may not optimally combine external estimators with new data in survival analysis.

Method: CARE fits a flexible family of reproducing kernel estimators on new data via penalised partial likelihood maximisation, then combines them with external estimators through convex combinations, optimising coefficients and regularisation via cross-validation.

Result: The aggregated estimator achieves $L_2$-error bounds that are at least as good as the best kernel estimator and external model, with simulation results supporting the theory and showing improvements in cardiovascular disease risk modelling.

Conclusion: CARE offers a robust approach for integrating new data with existing models in survival analysis, providing theoretical and empirical evidence of its effectiveness, and is available in the Python package care-survival.

Abstract: Clinical risk prediction models are regularly updated as new data, often with
additional covariates, become available. We propose CARE (Convex Aggregation of
relative Risk Estimators) as a general approach for combining existing
"external" estimators with a new data set in a time-to-event survival analysis
setting. Our method initially employs the new data to fit a flexible family of
reproducing kernel estimators via penalised partial likelihood maximisation.
The final relative risk estimator is then constructed as a convex combination
of the kernel and external estimators, with the convex combination coefficients
and regularisation parameters selected using cross-validation. We establish
high-probability bounds for the $L_2$-error of our proposed aggregated
estimator, showing that it achieves a rate of convergence that is at least as
good as both the optimal kernel estimator and the best external model.
Empirical results from simulation studies align with the theoretical results,
and we illustrate the improvements our methods provide for cardiovascular
disease risk modelling. Our methodology is implemented in the Python package
care-survival.

### [491] [Controlling the false discovery rate under a non-parametric graphical dependence model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24126)
*Drew T. Nguyen,William Fithian*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods for controlling the false discovery rate in multiple testing with dependent p-values, using a dependency graph. These methods are computationally efficient and perform similarly to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure when dependencies are minimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address false discovery rate control in multiple hypothesis testing scenarios where p-values are dependent, leveraging a known dependency graph to improve computational efficiency without sacrificing much statistical power.

Method: The authors propose computationally efficient procedures that adjust the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method for p-values with a known dependency graph, focusing on independence within neighborhoods and ignoring unrelated hypotheses.

Result: The methods achieve similar power to BH when dependencies are minimal, with the IndBH procedure being particularly fast, completing in seconds even for up to a million hypotheses.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their methods offer an efficient alternative for FDR control under dependency structures, maintaining high power when dependencies are sparse, which is common in practice.

Abstract: We propose sufficient conditions and computationally efficient procedures for
false discovery rate control in multiple testing when the $p$-values are
related by a known \emph{dependency graph} -- meaning that we assume
independence of $p$-values that are not within each other's neighborhoods, but
otherwise leave the dependence unspecified. Our methods' rejection sets
coincide with that of the Benjamini--Hochberg (BH) procedure whenever there are
no edges between BH rejections, and we find in simulations and a genomics data
example that their power approaches that of the BH procedure when there are few
such edges, as is commonly the case. Because our methods ignore all hypotheses
not in the BH rejection set, they are computationally efficient whenever that
set is small. Our fastest method, the IndBH procedure, typically finishes
within seconds even in simulations with up to one million hypotheses.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper introduces TEDI (Truthful, Expressive, and Dimension-Insensitive
approach), a discretization-free algorithm to learn truthful and
utility-maximizing mechanisms. Existing learning-based approaches often rely on
discretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to
inefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we
formalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes
to prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can
be equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The
core idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial
GroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally
approximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we
develop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous
sampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order
optimization. Theoretical analysis establishes that TEDI guarantees
truthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experimental
evaluation in the studied auction setting demonstrates that TEDI achieves
strong performance, competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art methods.
  This work presents the first approaches to learn truthful mechanisms without
outcome discretization, thereby enhancing algorithmic efficiency. The proposed
concepts, network architecture, and learning techniques might offer potential
value and provide new insights for automated mechanism design and
differentiable economics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how top-down attention operates under conditions of high visual attention competition, which hasn't been extensively studied before.

Method: The study investigates the effects of top-down attention on neural signals in the visual cortex when two stimuli with opposing modulatory goals are present in a shared receptive field.

Result: Top-down attention suppresses both task-relevant and irrelevant neural signals within 100 ms of stimuli onset during high competition.

Conclusion: The non-selective engagement of top-down attentional resources under high competition helps reduce irrelevant feedforward signals, suggesting a broader role in attentional control.

Abstract: It is known that when multiple stimuli are present, top-down attention
selectively enhances the neural signal in the visual cortex for task-relevant
stimuli, but this has been tested only under conditions of minimal competition
of visual attention. Here we show during high competition, that is, two stimuli
in a shared receptive field possessing opposing modulatory goals, top-down
attention suppresses both task-relevant and irrelevant neural signals within
100 ms of stimuli onset. This non-selective engagement of top-down attentional
resources serves to reduce the feedforward signal representing irrelevant
stimuli.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantifying the convergence rate of the underdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD)
is a classical topic, in large part due to the possibility for
diffusive-to-ballistic speedups -- as was recently established for the
continuous-time dynamics via space-time Poincare inequalities. A central
challenge for analyzing ULD is that its degeneracy necessitates the development
of new analysis approaches, e.g., the theory of hypocoercivity. In this paper,
we give a new coupling-based framework for analyzing ULD and its numerical
discretizations. First, in the continuous-time setting, we use this framework
to establish new parabolic Harnack inequalities for ULD. These are the first
Harnack inequalities that decay to zero in contractive settings, thereby
reflecting the convergence properties of ULD in addition to just its regularity
properties.
  Second, we build upon these Harnack inequalities to develop a local error
framework for analyzing discretizations of ULD in KL divergence. This extends
our framework in part III from uniformly elliptic diffusions to degenerate
diffusions, and shares its virtues: the framework is user-friendly, applies to
sophisticated discretization schemes, and does not require contractivity.
Applying this framework to the randomized midpoint discretization of ULD
establishes (i) the first ballistic acceleration result for log-concave
sampling (i.e., sublinear dependence on the condition number), and (ii) the
first $d^{1/3}$ iteration complexity guarantee for sampling to constant total
variation error in dimension $d$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of detection of sparse anomalies when monitoring a
large number of data streams continuously in time. This problem is addressed
using anytime-valid tests. In the context of a normal-means model and for a
fixed sample, this problem is known to exhibit a nontrivial phase transition
that characterizes when anomalies can and cannot be detected. We show, for the
anytime-valid version of the problem, testing procedures that can detect the
presence of anomalies quickly. Given that the goal is quick detection, existing
approaches to anytime-valid testing that study how evidence accumulates for
large times through log-optimality criteria is insufficient. This issue is
addressed in this context by studying log-optimal procedures for a fixed moment
in time, but as the number of streams grows larger. The resulting
characterization is related to, but not implied by the existing results for
fixed-sample tests. In addition, we also construct and analyze tests that are
parameter-adaptive and exhibit optimal performance (in a well defined sense)
even when the hypothesized model parameters are unknown. Numerical results
illustrate the behavior of the proposed tests in comparison with oracle tests
and suitable benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper studies theoretical lower bounds for estimating the trace of a
matrix function, $\text{tr}(f(A))$, focusing on methods that use Hutchinson's
method along with Block Krylov techniques. These methods work by approximating
matrix-vector products like $f(A)V$ using a Block Krylov subspace. This is
closely related to approximating functions with polynomials. We derive
theoretical upper bounds on how many Krylov steps are needed for functions such
as $A^{-1/2}$ and $A^{-1}$ by analyzing the upper bounds from the polynomial
approximation of their scalar equivalent. In addition, we also develop lower
limits on the number of queries needed for trace estimation, specifically for
$\text{tr}(W^{-p})$ where $W$ is a Wishart matrix. Our study clarifies the
connection between the number of steps in Block Krylov methods and the degree
of the polynomial used for approximation. This links the total cost of trace
estimation to basic limits in polynomial approximation and how much information
is needed for the computation.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in information measures
that quantify inaccuracy and uncertainty in systems. In this paper, we
introduce a novel concept called the Weighted Fractional Cumulative Residual
Inaccuracy (WFCRI). We develop several fundamental properties of WFCRI and
establish important bounds that reveal its analytical behavior. Further, we
examine the behavior of WFCRI under a mixture hazard model. A dynamic version
of WFCRI also proposed and studied its behavior under proportional hazard rate
model. An empirical estimation method for WFCRI under the proportional hazard
rate model framework is also proposed, and its performance is evaluated through
simulation studies. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of WFCRI measure in
characterizing chaotic dynamics by applying it to the Ricker and cubic maps.
The proposed measure is also applied to real data to assess the uncertainty.

weighted varextopy orderind, is introduced, and some of its key properties are
explored. Furtheremore, we propose two nonparametric estimators for the
weighted varextropy function. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the
performance of these estimators in terms of mean squared error(MSE) and bias.
Finally, we provide a characterization of the reciprocal distribution based on
the weighted varextropy measure. Some tests for reciprocal distribution are
constructed by using the proposed estimators and the powers of the tests are
compared with the powers of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. application to real

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Mean-field characterizations of first-order iterative algorithms -- including
Approximate Message Passing (AMP), stochastic and proximal gradient descent,
and Langevin diffusions -- have enabled a precise understanding of learning
dynamics in many statistical applications. For algorithms whose non-linearities
have a coordinate-separable form, it is known that such characterizations enjoy
a degree of universality with respect to the underlying data distribution.
However, mean-field characterizations of non-separable algorithm dynamics have
largely remained restricted to i.i.d. Gaussian or rotationally-invariant data.
  In this work, we initiate a study of universality for non-separable AMP
algorithms. We identify a general condition for AMP with polynomial
non-linearities, in terms of a Bounded Composition Property (BCP) for their
representing tensors, to admit a state evolution that holds universally for
matrices with non-Gaussian entries. We then formalize a condition of
BCP-approximability for Lipschitz AMP algorithms to enjoy a similar universal
guarantee. We demonstrate that many common classes of non-separable
non-linearities are BCP-approximable, including local denoisers, spectral
denoisers for generic signals, and compositions of separable functions with
generic linear maps, implying the universality of state evolution for AMP
algorithms employing these non-linearities.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces Average Quantile Regression (AQR), a new regression method that improves upon quantile regression and expectiles by being smooth, comonotonically additive, and better at handling tail losses. It works well with big, complex datasets and has good statistical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a regression model that goes beyond just the mean, offers better interpretability than expectiles, and effectively handles tail losses in risk management.

Method: The paper proposes AQR, a non-parametric regression model that is smooth and comonotonically additive, designed to capture distributional information across all positions while accounting for tail loss severity.

Result: AQR is shown to be effective in risk assessment and portfolio optimization through a case study, and it demonstrates strong performance in high-dimensional and large datasets.

Conclusion: AQR is a versatile and flexible regression model that can encompass traditional models and risk measures as special cases, offering improved interpretability and statistical properties for complex data analysis.

Abstract: Regression models that go beyond the mean, alongside coherent risk measures,
have been important tools in modern data analysis. This paper introduces the
innovative concept of Average Quantile Regression (AQR), which is smooth at the
quantile-like level, comonotonically additive, and explicitly accounts for the
severity of tail losses relative to quantile regression. AQR serves as a
versatile regression model capable of describing distributional information
across all positions, akin to quantile regression, yet offering enhanced
interpretability compared to expectiles. Numerous traditional regression models
and coherent risk measures can be regarded as special cases of AQR. As a
flexible non-parametric regression model, AQR demonstrates outstanding
performance in analyzing high-dimensional and large datasets, particularly
those generated by distributed systems, and provides a convenient framework for
their statistical analysis. The corresponding estimators are rigorously
derived, and their asymptotic properties are thoroughly developed. In a risk
management context, the case study confirms AQR's effectiveness in risk
assessment and portfolio optimization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Elliptically symmetric distributions are a classic example of a
semiparametric model where the location vector and the scatter matrix (or a
parameterization of them) are the two finite-dimensional parameters of
interest, while the density generator represents an
\textit{infinite-dimensional nuisance} term. This basic representation of the
elliptic model can be made more accurate, rich, and flexible by considering
additional \textit{finite-dimensional nuisance} parameters. Our aim is
therefore to investigate the deep and counter-intuitive links between
statistical efficiency in estimating the parameters of interest in the presence
of both finite and infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters. Unlike previous
works that addressed this problem using Le Cam's asymptotic theory, our
approach here is purely geometric: efficiency will be analyzed using tools such
as projections and tangent spaces embedded in the relevant Hilbert space. This
allows us to obtain original results also for the case where the location
vector and the scatter matrix are parameterized by a finite-dimensional vector
that can be partitioned in two sub-vectors: one containing the parameters of
interest and the other containing the nuisance parameters. As an example, we
illustrate how the obtained results can be applied to the well-known
\virg{low-rank} parameterization. Furthermore, while the theoretical analysis
will be developed for Real Elliptically Symmetric (RES) distributions, we show
how to extend our results to the case of Circular and Non-Circular Complex
Elliptically Symmetric (C-CES and NC-CES) distributions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Certain tasks in high-dimensional statistics become easier when the
underlying distribution satisfies a local-to-global property called approximate
tensorization of entropy (ATE). For example, the Glauber dynamics Markov chain
of an ATE distribution mixes fast and can produce approximate samples in a
small amount of time, since such a distribution satisfies a modified
log-Sobolev inequality. Moreover, identity-testing for an ATE distribution
requires few samples if the tester is given coordinate conditional access to
the unknown distribution, as shown by Blanca, Chen, \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, and
Vigoda (COLT 2023).
  A natural class of distributions that do not satisfy ATE consists of mixtures
of (few) distributions that do satisfy ATE. We study the complexity of
identity-testing and sampling for these distributions. Our main results are the
following:
  1. We show fast mixing of Glauber dynamics from a data-based initialization,
with optimal sample complexity, for mixtures of distributions satisfying
modified log-Sobolev inequalities. This extends work of Huang, Koehler, Lee,
Mohanty, Rajaraman, Vuong, and Wu (STOC 2025, COLT 2025) for mixtures of
distributions satisfying Poincar\'e inequalities.
  2. Answering an open question posed by Blanca et al., we give efficient
identity-testers for mixtures of ATE distributions in the
coordinate-conditional sampling access model. We also give some simplifications
and improvements to the original algorithm of Blanca et al.

Motivation: To address the open problem of reachability in data VASS by analyzing the impact of different permutation groups on complexity.

Method: Examining various permutation groups (trivial, symmetric, alternating, cyclic) and their effects on the reachability problem in VASS.

Result: Reachability in symmetric VASS with symmetric groups is in PSPACE, unlike the Ackermannian complexity of general VASS. The paper also investigates combinations of groups.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how permutation groups influence the complexity of reachability in VASS, offering a pathway to tackle data VASS problems.

Abstract: We investigate the reachability problem in symmetric vector addition systems
with states (VASS), where transitions are invariant under a group of
permutations of coordinates. One extremal case, the trivial groups, yields
general VASS. In another extremal case, the symmetric groups, we show that the
reachability problem can be solved in PSPACE, regardless of the dimension of
input VASS (to be contrasted with Ackermannian complexity in general VASS). We
also consider other groups, in particular alternating and cyclic ones.
Furthermore, motivated by the open status of the reachability problem in data
VASS, we estimate the gain in complexity when the group arises as a combination
of the trivial and symmetric groups.

TL;DR: FedCLAM is a new federated learning method for medical imaging that uses client-adaptive momentum and personalized dampening to handle data discrepancies and improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging data varies across institutions due to different devices and populations, leading to challenges in federated learning. Existing methods don't adapt well to these variations, so there's a need for a better approach.

Method: FedCLAM introduces client-adaptive momentum terms based on each client's loss reduction during local training and a personalized dampening factor to prevent overfitting. It also uses an intensity alignment loss to match foreground distributions across different image intensities.

Result: FedCLAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in medical segmentation tasks on two datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: FedCLAM is a promising approach for federated learning in medical imaging, effectively addressing inter-institutional data discrepancies and improving model performance.

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that keeps data under
stakeholder control while achieving superior performance over isolated
training. While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in
all federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse
imaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's
effectiveness. Existing aggregation methods generally fail to adapt across
varied circumstances. To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates
\textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss
reduction during local training, as well as a \textit{personalized dampening
factor} to curb overfitting. We further introduce a novel \textit{intensity
alignment} loss that matches predicted and ground-truth foreground
distributions to handle heterogeneous image intensity profiles across
institutions and devices. Extensive evaluations on two datasets show that
FedCLAM surpasses eight cutting-edge methods in medical segmentation tasks,
underscoring its efficacy. The code is available at

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image
processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop
effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current
multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,
dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing
these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal
Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a
promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual
descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual
inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive
cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into
the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.
To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting
strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of
challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy
for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical
imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on
seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.
Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby
confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations
mentioned earlier. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining visualizes histology but lacks

structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and
proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the
non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&E and IHC images. This study proposes a
mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual
staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that
disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across
modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for
precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3)
a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level
structural consistency between H&E-IHC images. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its biomedical potential. Codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without
exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered
by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data
across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based
data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the
federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images.
Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative
Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then
simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast
ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are
adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating
a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to
0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that
excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the
importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our
findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to
enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

Abstract: Echocardiography is routine for cardiac examination. However, 2D ultrasound
(US) struggles with accurate metric calculation and direct observation of 3D
cardiac structures. Moreover, 3D US is limited by low resolution, small field
of view and scarce availability in practice. Constructing the cardiac
anatomical twin from 2D images is promising to provide precise treatment
planning and clinical quantification. However, it remains challenging due to
the rare paired data, complex structures, and US noises. In this study, we
introduce a novel generative framework UltraTwin, to obtain cardiac anatomical
twin from sparse multi-view 2D US. Our contribution is three-fold. First,
pioneered the construction of a real-world and high-quality dataset containing
strictly paired multi-view 2D US and CT, and pseudo-paired data. Second, we
propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction
optimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware
constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraTwin reconstructs
high-quality anatomical twins versus strong competitors. We believe it advances
anatomical twin modeling for potential applications in personalized cardiac
care.

Abstract: Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrashort echo-time (UTE)
represents a recent breakthrough in lung structure imaging, providing image
resolution and quality comparable to computed tomography (CT). Due to the
absence of ionising radiation, MRI is often preferred over CT in paediatric
diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders
in Caucasians. To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring
systems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and
progression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in
structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate
quantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial
intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring
consists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3)
lung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification
and reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per
subject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring.
Additionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate
(p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973,
p=5.85e-9). This tool has great potential to streamline the workflow of UTE
lung MRI in clinical settings, and be extended to other structural lung MRI
sequences (e.g., BLADE MRI), and for other lung diseases (e.g.,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia).

Abstract: Generating radiology reports from CT scans remains a complex task due to the
nuanced nature of medical imaging and the variability in clinical
documentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for generating
renal radiology reports from 2D CT slices. First, we extract structured
abnormality features using a multi-task learning model trained to identify
lesion attributes such as location, size, enhancement, and attenuation. These
extracted features are subsequently combined with the corresponding CT image
and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate natural language
report sentences aligned with clinical findings. We conduct experiments on a
curated dataset of renal CT studies with manually annotated
sentence-slice-feature triplets and evaluate performance using both
classification metrics and natural language generation metrics. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms random baselines across all
abnormality types, and the generated reports capture key clinical content with
reasonable textual accuracy. This exploratory work highlights the feasibility
of modular, feature-informed report generation for renal imaging. Future
efforts will focus on extending this pipeline to 3D CT volumes and further
improving clinical fidelity in multimodal medical AI systems.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is widely accessible and radiation-free but has a steep
learning curve due to its dynamic nature and non-standard imaging planes.
Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the
patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning
(DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric
measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally
time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to
concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements.
Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by
projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving
ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient
transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one
streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless
setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader
accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney
Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with
MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model
implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution,
enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.

Abstract: Background: Conventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in
paediatric and congenital heart disease uses 2D, breath-hold, balanced steady
state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging for assessment of function and
cardiac-gated, respiratory-navigated, static 3D bSSFP whole-heart imaging for
anatomical assessment. Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing
real-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully
segmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were
trained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;
b) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice
direction); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,
RV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients
undergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on
prospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative
metrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D
cines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.
Results: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a
total post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant
biases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and
correlation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,
although there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from
concatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method
has short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being
available within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging
suggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical
practice.

Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures from MRI is crucial for evaluating brain
morphology, yet existing CNN and transformer-based methods struggle to
delineate complex structures accurately. While current diffusion models have
shown promise in image segmentation, they are inadequate when applied directly
to brain MRI due to neglecting anatomical information. To address this, we
propose Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion (CA-Diff), a framework integrating
spatial anatomical features to enhance segmentation accuracy of the diffusion
model. Specifically, we introduce distance field as an auxiliary anatomical
condition to provide global spatial context, alongside a collaborative
diffusion process to model its joint distribution with anatomical structures,
enabling effective utilization of anatomical features for segmentation.
Furthermore, we introduce a consistency loss to refine relationships between
the distance field and anatomical structures and design a time adapted channel
attention module to enhance the U-Net feature fusion procedure. Extensive
experiments show that CA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, particularly in
capturing how the brain transitions between various functional states.
Recently, metastability, which refers to temporarily stable brain states, has
offered a promising paradigm to quantify complex brain signals into
interpretable, discretized representations. In particular, compared to
cluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging
vector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful
reconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods
ignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain
dynamics into representative and stable embeddings. In this study, we propose a
Hierarchical State space-based Tokenization network, termed HST, which
quantizes brain states and transitions in a hierarchical structure based on a
state space-based model. We introduce a refined clustered Vector-Quantization
Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) that incorporates quantization error feedback
and clustering to improve quantization performance while facilitating
metastability with representative and stable token representations. We validate
our HST on two public fMRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in
quantifying the hierarchical dynamics of the brain and its potential in disease
diagnosis and reconstruction performance. Our method offers a promising
framework for the characterization of brain dynamics, facilitating the analysis
of metastability.

Abstract: The recent release of RadGenome-Chest CT has significantly advanced CT-based
report generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on global
features, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may
cause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose
MedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM)
framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region
Representative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained
vision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates
global tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens
highlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive
information effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates
pseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract
region-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant
regions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation
results to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size,
diameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the
MLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts. To ensure rigorous
evaluation, we conducted benchmark experiments on report generation using the
RadGenome-Chest CT. MedRegion-CT achieved state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing methods in natural language generation quality and
clinical relevance while maintaining interpretability. The code for our
framework is publicly available.

Abstract: We present our solution for the Multi-Source COVID-19 Detection Challenge,
which aims to classify chest CT scans into COVID and Non-COVID categories
across data collected from four distinct hospitals and medical centers. A major
challenge in this task lies in the domain shift caused by variations in imaging
protocols, scanners, and patient populations across institutions. To enhance
the cross-domain generalization of our model, we incorporate Variance Risk
Extrapolation (VREx) into the training process. VREx encourages the model to
maintain consistent performance across multiple source domains by explicitly
minimizing the variance of empirical risks across environments. This
regularization strategy reduces overfitting to center-specific features and
promotes learning of domain-invariant representations. We further apply Mixup
data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness. Mixup interpolates
both the inputs and labels of randomly selected pairs of training samples,
encouraging the model to behave linearly between examples and enhancing its
resilience to noise and limited data. Our method achieves an average macro F1
score of 0.96 across the four sources on the validation set, demonstrating
strong generalization.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a major cause of death globally, and accurate early

require large amounts of labeled data, which are often scarce in practice. We
propose a physiology-aware pipeline that (i) synthesizes 12-lead ECGs with
tunable MI morphology and realistic noise, and (ii) pre-trains recurrent and
transformer classifiers with self-supervised masked-autoencoding plus a joint
reconstruction-classification objective. We validate the realism of synthetic
ECGs via statistical and visual analysis, confirming that key morphological
features are preserved. Pretraining on synthetic data consistently improved
classification performance, particularly in low-data settings, with AUC gains
of up to 4 percentage points. These results show that controlled synthetic ECGs
can help improve MI detection when real clinical data is limited.

Abstract: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D

surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely
identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is
paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model
(VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for
real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a

a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything
model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented
language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more
in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose
semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of
semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and
semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization,
which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training,
particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to
demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but suffers
from image artifacts and loss of detail due to quantum and electronic noise,
potentially impacting diagnostic accuracy. Transformer combined with diffusion
models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless,
existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details.
To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT)
is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy
that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns
with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we
employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in
high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential
anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then
utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the
capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse
local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer
information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature
representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for
optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at
identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior
noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Existing learning-based methods effectively reconstruct HDR images from
multi-exposure LDR inputs with extended dynamic range and improved detail, but
they rely more on empirical design rather than theoretical foundation, which
can impact their reliability. To address these limitations, we propose the
cross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR
reconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks --
alignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving
synergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method
formulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
estimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors
across LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems
through joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we
reimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming
the conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with
carefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each
iteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that
alternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel
Fusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging
misaligned content and exposure discrepancies. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate AFUNet's superior performance,
consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, where accurate boundary delineation is essential for
precise lesion localization, organ identification, and quantitative assessment.
In recent years, deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced
segmentation accuracy. However, two major challenges remain. First, the
performance of these methods heavily relies on large-scale annotated datasets,
which are often difficult to obtain in medical scenarios due to privacy
concerns and high annotation costs. Second, clinically challenging scenarios,
such as low contrast in certain imaging modalities and blurry lesion boundaries
caused by malignancy, still pose obstacles to precise segmentation. To address
these challenges, we propose MedSAM-CA, an architecture-level fine-tuning
approach that mitigates reliance on extensive manual annotations by adapting
the pretrained foundation model, Medical Segment Anything (MedSAM). MedSAM-CA
introduces two key components: the Convolutional Attention-Enhanced Boundary
Refinement Network (CBR-Net) and the Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block
(Atte-FFB). CBR-Net operates in parallel with the MedSAM encoder to recover
boundary information potentially overlooked by long-range attention mechanisms,
leveraging hierarchical convolutional processing. Atte-FFB, embedded in the
MedSAM decoder, fuses multi-level fine-grained features from skip connections

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is essential in medical
diagnostics. As the latest generative models, diffusion models (DMs) have
struggled to produce high-fidelity images due to their stochastic nature in
image domains. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) yield both compact and detailed
prior knowledge in latent domains, which could effectively guide the model
towards more effective learning of the original data distribution. Inspired by
this, we propose Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) provided by
pre-trained LDMs to enhance data consistency in MRI reconstruction tasks.
Specifically, we first construct a Visual-Mamba-based backbone, which enables
efficient encoding and reconstruction of under-sampled images. Then pre-trained
LDMs are integrated to provide conditional priors in both latent and image
domains. A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion
in multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior
in both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with
generated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for
self-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we
propose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration
signal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The code is
available at https://github.com/Zolento/MDPG.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising
direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the
model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works
in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider
inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show
diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation;
ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data
generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized
FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST),
which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and
global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a
Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site
training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to
encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized
globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including
the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel
selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating
model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose
Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an
explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model
convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multilinear transformations are key in high-performance computing (HPC) and
artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, where data is represented as tensors.
However, their high computational and memory demands, which grow with
dimensionality, often slow down critical tasks. Moreover, scaling computation
by enlarging the number of parallel processing units substantially increases
energy consumption, limiting widespread adoption, especially for sparse data,
which is common in HPC and AI applications. This paper introduces the Trilinear
Algorithm and isomorphic to algorithm Device Architecture (TriADA) to address
these challenges with the following innovations: (1) a massively parallel,
low-rank algorithm for computing a family of trilinear (3D) discrete orthogonal
transformations (3D-DXTs), which is a special case of the more general 3-mode
matrix-by-tensor multiplication (3D-GEMT); (2) a new outer-product-based GEMM
kernel with decoupled streaming active memory, specially designed to accelerate
3D-GEMT operation; (3) an isomorphic to the proposed algorithm, fully
distributed 3D network of mesh interconnected processing elements or cells with
a coordinate-free, data-driven local processing activity, which is independent
of problem size; (4) an elastic sparse outer-product (ESOP) method that avoids
unnecessary computing and communication operations with zero-valued operands,
thereby enhancing energy efficiency, computational accuracy, and stability.
TriADA is capable of performing a variety of trilinear transformations with
hypercubic arithmetic complexity in a linear number of time-steps. The
massively parallel, scalable, and energy-efficient architecture of TriADA is
ideal for accelerating multilinear tensor operations, which are the most
demanding parts of AI and HPC workloads.

Conclusion: The paper aims to inspire future research and development in performance measurement for DCC and IoT by emphasizing sustainability, energy efficiency, and system observability.

Abstract: Over the Eight decades, computing paradigms have shifted from large,
centralized systems to compact, distributed architectures, leading to the rise
of the Distributed Computing Continuum (DCC). In this model, multiple layers
such as cloud, edge, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile platforms work
together to support a wide range of applications. Recently, the emergence of
Generative AI and large language models has further intensified the demand for
computational resources across this continuum. Although traditional performance
metrics have provided a solid foundation, they need to be revisited and
expanded to keep pace with changing computational demands and application
requirements. Accurate performance measurements benefit both system designers
and users by supporting improvements in efficiency and promoting alignment with
system goals. In this context, we review commonly used metrics in DCC and IoT
environments. We also discuss emerging performance dimensions that address
evolving computing needs, such as sustainability, energy efficiency, and system
observability. We also outline criteria and considerations for selecting
appropriate metrics, aiming to inspire future research and development in this
critical area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI)
with significant advancements such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and
Databricks' DBRX. This paper addresses the cost and scalability challenges
encountered when constructing private LLM systems for personal or small group
services, as aimed by Apple Intelligence. A Mac Studio cluster with Apple's M2
Ultra chips is established as a cost-efficient solution to host and accelerate
the pretrained DBRX model with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our
performance analysis reveal that parallel execution of the model's experts
across two to four machine nodes significantly reduces inference time. We find
that computation time for the experts is comparable to the communication time
for exchanging their outputs, emphasizing the importance of network latency
over bandwidth. We also observe significant management overhead due to Apple
software stack's memory management logic. Based on these findings, we develop
optimization schemes to eliminate the memory management overhead. As a result,
the Mac Studio cluster is 1.15 times more cost-efficient than the
state-of-the-art AI supercomputer with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, we
construct a performance model to estimate system performance under varying
configurations, and the model provides valuable insights for designing private
LLM systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As machine learning inferences increasingly move to edge devices, adapting to
diverse computational capabilities, hardware, and memory constraints becomes
more critical. Instead of relying on a pre-trained model fixed for all future
inference queries across diverse edge devices, we argue that planning an
inference pattern with a request-specific model tailored to the device's
computational capacity, accuracy requirements, and time constraints is more
cost-efficient and robust to diverse scenarios. To this end, we propose an
accuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that integrates joint
model quantization and inference partitioning. In this approach, the server
dynamically responds to inference queries by sending a quantized model and
adaptively sharing the inference workload with the device. Meanwhile, the
device's computational power, channel capacity, and accuracy requirements are
considered when deciding.
  Furthermore, we introduce a new optimization framework for the inference
system, incorporating joint model quantization and partitioning. Our approach
optimizes layer-wise quantization bit width and partition points to minimize
time consumption and cost while accounting for varying accuracy requirements of
tasks through an accuracy degradation metric in our optimization model. To our
knowledge, this work represents the first exploration of optimizing
quantization layer-wise bit-width in the inference serving system, by
introducing theoretical measurement of accuracy degradation. Simulation results
demonstrate a substantial reduction in overall time and power consumption, with
computation payloads decreasing by over 80% and accuracy degradation kept below
1%.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Scientific behavior is often characterized by a tension between building upon
established knowledge and introducing novel ideas. Here, we investigate whether
this tension is reflected in the relationship between the similarity of a
scientific paper to previous research and its eventual citation rate. To
operationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary
metrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic
neighborhood: (1) \emph{density} ($\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed
number of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those
papers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\alpha$), defined as
the average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors.
We tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its
subsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach,
surveying $\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five
different document embeddings. While the individual effects of $\rho$ on
citation count are small and variable, incorporating density-based predictors
consistently improves out-of-sample prediction when added to baseline models.
These results suggest that the density of a paper's surrounding scientific
literature may carry modest but informative signals about its eventual impact.
Meanwhile, we find no evidence that publication asymmetry improves model
predictions of citation rates. Our work provides a scalable framework for
linking document embeddings to scientometric outcomes and highlights new
questions regarding the role that semantic similarity plays in shaping the
dynamics of scientific reward.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a TTS system for L2 speakers, using vowel duration differences to enhance clarity, showing improved transcription accuracy and perception without listeners realizing the changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the specific needs of L2 speakers by improving TTS clarity without slowing down speech.

Method: Developed a 'clarity mode' in Matcha-TTS by adjusting vowel durations, conducted perception studies with French-L1 and English-L2 listeners, and compared Whisper-ASR's performance.

Result: French-L1, English-L2 listeners had 9.15% fewer transcription errors with clarity mode; found it more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed speech; listeners unaware of the effects despite improved accuracy.

Conclusion: Clarity mode enhances TTS for L2 speakers, highlighting the discrepancy between actual and perceived intelligibility, and the limitations of using Whisper-ASR for assessing L2 intelligibility.

Abstract: We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language
(L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense
(longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS.
Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer
(at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it
more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably,
listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error
rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words
was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not
correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that
Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult
vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for
these individuals.

Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of

Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity

models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling
applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech embeddings can leak sensitive info like speaker identity or demographics, causing bias and privacy issues. The need is for a method that maintains fairness and privacy without losing essential speech content for tasks.

Method: Uses Donsker-Varadhan MI estimation to train an encoder that filters out sensitive attributes from embeddings, ensuring task-relevant info remains.

Result: WavShape reduces MI with sensitive attributes by 81% and retains 97% of task-relevant info across three datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating information theory with self-supervised models improves fair, privacy-conscious, and efficient speech systems.

Abstract: Speech embeddings often retain sensitive attributes such as speaker identity,
accent, or demographic information, posing risks in biased model training and
privacy leakage. We propose WavShape, an information-theoretic speech
representation learning framework that optimizes embeddings for fairness and
privacy while preserving task-relevant information. We leverage mutual
information (MI) estimation using the Donsker-Varadhan formulation to guide an
MI-based encoder that systematically filters sensitive attributes while
maintaining speech content essential for downstream tasks. Experimental results
on three known datasets show that WavShape reduces MI between embeddings and
sensitive attributes by up to 81% while retaining 97% of task-relevant
information. By integrating information theory with self-supervised speech
models, this work advances the development of fair, privacy-aware, and
resource-efficient speech systems.

Abstract: Hierarchical planning is a powerful approach to model long sequences

music, this paper explores an even more important aspect: concept hierarchy,
which involves generating music ideas, transforming them, and ultimately
organizing them--across musical time and space--into a complete composition. To
this end, we introduce TOMI (Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas) as a
novel approach in deep music generation and develop a TOMI-based model via
instruction-tuned foundation LLM. Formally, we represent a multi-track
composition process via a sparse, four-dimensional space characterized by clips
(short audio or MIDI segments), sections (temporal positions), tracks
(instrument layers), and transformations (elaboration methods). Our model is
capable of generating multi-track electronic music with full-song structure,
and we further integrate the TOMI-based model with the REAPER digital audio
workstation, enabling interactive human-AI co-creation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach produces higher-quality electronic music with
stronger structural coherence compared to baselines.

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language

acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However,
existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction
with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the
limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic
fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict
between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task
learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves
performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of
state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those
existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer
achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling
methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker
similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The
reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec,
the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a
speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate. Code and models are

Abstract: Accurate recognition of Emergency Vehicle (EV) sirens is critical for the
integration of intelligent transportation systems, smart city monitoring
systems, and autonomous driving technologies. Modern automatic solutions are
limited by the lack of large scale, curated datasets and by the computational
demands of state of the art sound event detection models. This work introduces
E2PANNs (Efficient Emergency Pre trained Audio Neural Networks), a lightweight
Convolutional Neural Network architecture derived from the PANNs framework,
specifically optimized for binary EV siren detection. Leveraging our dedicated
subset of AudioSet (AudioSet EV) we fine-tune and evaluate E2PANNs across
multiple reference datasets and test its viability on embedded hardware. The
experimental campaign includes ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and
real-time inference deployment on edge device. Interpretability analyses
exploiting Guided Backpropagation and ScoreCAM algorithms provide insights into
the model internal representations and validate its ability to capture distinct
spectrotemporal patterns associated with different types of EV sirens. Real
time performance is assessed through frame wise and event based detection
metrics, as well as a detailed analysis of false positive activations. Results
demonstrate that E2PANNs establish a new state of the art in this research
domain, with high computational efficiency, and suitability for edge-based
audio monitoring and safety-critical applications.

general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to
symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative
model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains
competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification
benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve
state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning
demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises
copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity
verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a
potential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable
of preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention.
However, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing
applications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new
demands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks
remains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process,
necessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid
iteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making
proactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks.
To address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative
image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key
modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright
and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative
quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a
dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion
sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and
the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The
experimental results indicate that TAG-WM achieves SOTA tampering robustness
and tampering localization capability with distortions while maintaining
lossless generation quality and a considerable capacity of 256 bits.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of optical engineering, precise alignment of
multi-lens imaging systems is critical yet challenging, as even minor
misalignments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional alignment
methods rely on specialized equipment and are time-consuming processes,
highlighting the need for automated and scalable solutions. We present two
complementary deep learning-based inverse-design methods for diagnosing
misalignments in multi-element lens systems using only optical measurements.
First, we use ray-traced spot diagrams to predict five-degree-of-freedom
(5-DOF) errors in a 6-lens photographic prime, achieving a mean absolute error
of 0.031mm in lateral translation and 0.011$^\circ$ in tilt. We also introduce
a physics-based simulation pipeline that utilizes grayscale synthetic camera
images, enabling a deep learning model to estimate 4-DOF, decenter and tilt
errors in both two- and six-lens multi-lens systems. These results show the
potential to reshape manufacturing and quality control in precision imaging.

Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated
research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with
more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to
the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on
the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra
bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit
allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise
allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and
accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and
the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable
through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths
and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle
different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal
lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically
formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may
incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size
renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets,
including the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and
DVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and
computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our
SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit
budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be fully
open-sourced.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Competitive Co-evolutionary Algorithms (CCEAs) are often hampered by complex
dynamics like intransitivity and the Red Queen effect, leading to unstable
convergence. To counter these challenges, this paper introduces the Marker Gene
Method (MGM), a framework that establishes stability by using a 'marker gene'
as a dynamic benchmark and an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance
exploration and exploitation. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs
demonstrating that MGM creates strong attractors near Nash Equilibria within
the Strictly Competitive Game framework. Empirically, MGM demonstrates its
efficacy across a spectrum of challenges: it stabilizes the canonical
Rock-Paper-Scissors game, significantly improves the performance of C-RMOEA/D
on ZDT benchmarks, and, when augmented with a Memory Pool (MP) extension, it
successfully tames the notoriously pathological Shapley Biased Game. This work
presents a theoretically sound and empirically validated framework that
substantially enhances the stability and robustness of CCEAs in complex
competitive environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Here, we outline how Rothman diagrams provide a geometric perspective that
can help epidemiologists understand the relationships between effect measure
modification (which we call association measure modification), collapsibility,
and confounding. A Rothman diagram plots the risk of disease in the unexposed
on the x-axis and the risk in the exposed on the y-axis. Crude and
stratum-specific risks in the two exposure groups define points in the unit
square. When there is modification of a measure of association $M$ by a
covariate $C$, the stratum-specific values of $M$ differ across strata defined
by $C$, so the stratum-specific points are on different contour lines of $M$.
We show how collapsibility can be defined in terms of standardization instead
of no confounding, and we show that a measure of association is collapsible if
and only if all its contour lines are straight. We illustrate these ideas using
data from a study in Newcastle, United Kingdom, where the causal effect of
smoking on 20-year mortality was confounded by age. From this perspective, it
is clear that association measure modification and collapsibility are logically
independent of confounding. This distinction can be obscured when these
concepts are taught using regression models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact software
development, especially in the Open-Source Software (OSS) sector. To understand
this impact, we first outline the mechanisms through which LLMs may influence
OSS through code development, collaborative knowledge transfer, and skill
development. We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work
in these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary
ChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with
two-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in
three similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users. We
find that access to ChatGPT increases developer productivity by 6.4%, knowledge
sharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%. These benefits vary
significantly by user experience level: novice developers primarily experience
productivity gains, whereas more experienced developers benefit more from
improved knowledge sharing and accelerated skill acquisition. In addition, we
find that LLM-assisted learning is highly context-dependent, with the greatest
benefits observed in technically complex, fragmented, or rapidly evolving
contexts. We show that the productivity effects of LLMs extend beyond direct
code generation to include enhanced collaborative learning and knowledge
exchange among developers; dynamics that are essential for gaining a holistic
understanding of LLMs' impact in OSS. Our findings offer critical managerial
implications: strategically deploying LLMs can accelerate novice developers'
onboarding and productivity, empower intermediate developers to foster
knowledge sharing and collaboration, and support rapid skill acquisition,
together enhancing long-term organizational productivity and agility.

*Yu Ma,Xingyu Zhou,Xiao Li,Le Liang,Shi Jin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-stage unsupervised learning framework for resource allocation in RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA systems, achieving near-optimal sum rate with significantly reduced runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RIS are critical for 6G, but resource allocation in RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA systems is challenging. Traditional methods are computationally expensive, so there's a need for efficient alternatives.

Method: A two-stage framework: BeamNet predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet allocates RBs using equivalent CSI from BeamNet. Active beamforming uses maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. Quantization and Gumbel-softmax trick handle discrete constraints.

Result: The method achieves 99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with 0.036% of the runtime, showing robustness under varying channel and user conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses resource allocation challenges in RIS-assisted systems, offering a computationally efficient solution while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless
systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA
system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised
learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS
beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes
BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which
allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active
beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To
handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and
the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training
enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves
99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and
it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.

Abstract: Continuous, non-invasive pregnancy monitoring is crucial for minimising
potential complications. The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) represents a
promising tool for assessing fetal health beyond clinical environments.
Home-based monitoring necessitates the use of a minimal number of comfortable
and durable electrodes, such as dry textile electrodes. However, this setup
presents many challenges, including increased noise and motion artefacts, which
complicate the accurate extraction of fECG signals. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a pioneering method for extracting fECG from
single-channel recordings obtained using dry textile electrodes using AI
techniques. We created a new dataset by simulating abdominal recordings,
including noise closely resembling real-world characteristics of in-vivo
recordings through dry textile electrodes, alongside mECG and fECG. To ensure
the reliability of the extracted fECG, we propose an innovative pipeline based
on a complex-valued denoising network, Complex UNet. Unlike previous approaches
that focused solely on signal magnitude, our method processes both real and
imaginary components of the spectrogram, addressing phase information and
preventing incongruous predictions. We evaluated our novel pipeline against
traditional, well-established approaches, on both simulated and real data in
terms of fECG extraction and R-peak detection. The results showcase that our
suggested method achieves new state-of-the-art results, enabling an accurate
extraction of fECG morphology across all evaluated settings. This method is the
first to effectively extract fECG signals from single-channel recordings using
dry textile electrodes, making a significant advancement towards a fully
non-invasive and self-administered fECG extraction solution.

Abstract: Using mobile phone video of the fingertip as a data source for estimating
vital signs such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) during daily life
has long been suggested. While existing literature indicates that these
estimates are accurate to within several beats or breaths per minute, the data
used to draw these conclusions are typically collected in laboratory
environments under careful experimental control, and yet the results are
assumed to generalize to daily life. In an effort to test it, a team of
researchers collected a large dataset of mobile phone video recordings made
during daily life and annotated with ground truth HR and RR labels from N=111
participants. They found that traditional algorithm performance on the
fingerprint videos is worse than previously reported (7 times and 13 times
worse for RR and HR, respectively). Fortunately, recent advancements in deep
learning, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer a promising
solution to improve this performance. This study proposes a new method for
estimating HR and RR using a novel 3D deep CNN, demonstrating a reduced error
in estimated HR by 68% and RR by 75%. These promising results suggest that
regressor-based deep learning approaches should be used in estimating HR and
RR.

Abstract: Groundwater supports ecosystems, agriculture, and drinking water supplies
worldwide, yet effective monitoring remains challenging due to sparse data,
computational constraints, and delayed outputs from traditional approaches. We

Abstract: Fall detection is critical to support the growing elderly population,

data scarcity challenges or compromise privacy. We propose a novel IoT-based
Fall Detection as a Service (FDaaS) framework to assist the elderly in living
independently and safely by accurately detecting falls. We design a
service-oriented architecture that leverages Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar sensors
as an IoT health-sensing service, ensuring privacy and minimal intrusion. We
address the challenges of data scarcity by utilizing a Fall Detection
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (FD-GPT) that uses augmentation techniques.
We developed a protocol to collect a comprehensive dataset of the elderly daily
activities and fall events. This resulted in a real dataset that carefully
mimics the elderly's routine. We rigorously evaluate and compare various models
using this dataset. Experimental results show our approach achieves 90.72%
accuracy and 89.33% precision in distinguishing between fall events and regular
activities of daily living.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role today in smart building
infrastructures, from simple smart-home applications, to more sophisticated
industrial type installations. The vast amounts of data generated from relevant
systems can be processed in different ways revealing important information.
This is especially true in the era of edge computing, when advanced data
analysis and decision-making is gradually moving to the edge of the network
where devices are generally characterised by low computing resources. In this
context, one of the emerging main challenges is related to maintaining data
analysis accuracy even with less data that can be efficiently handled by low
resource devices. The present work focuses on correlation analysis of data
retrieved from a pilot IoT network installation monitoring a small smart office
by means of environmental and energy consumption sensors. The research
motivation was to find statistical correlation between the monitoring variables
that will allow the use of machine learning (ML) prediction algorithms for
energy consumption reducing input parameters. For this to happen, a series of
hypothesis tests for the correlation of three different environmental variables
with the energy consumption were carried out. A total of ninety tests were
performed, thirty for each pair of variables. In these tests, p-values showed
the existence of strong or semi-strong correlation with two environmental
variables, and of a weak correlation with a third one. Using the proposed
methodology, we manage without examining the entire data set to exclude weak
correlated variables while keeping the same score of accuracy.

Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic
characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform
deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised
ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking
fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity
Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but
informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence
of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while
simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate
it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL
paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1)
Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features
reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this,
Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation
learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG
analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million
recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream
tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces
SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released
publicly.

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, massive H$^2$AD is viewed as a potential
technology for the future 6G wireless network. For such a structure, it is a
challenging task to design a low-complexity and high-performance fusion of
target direction values sensed by different sub-array groups with fewer use of
prior knowledge. To address this issue, a lightweight Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB)-ratio-weight fusion (WF) method is proposed, which approximates inverse
CRLB of each subarray using antenna number reciprocals to eliminate real-time
CRLB computation. This reduces complexity and prior knowledge dependence while
preserving fusion performance. Moreover, a multi-branch deep neural network
(MBDNN) is constructed to further enhance direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensing by
leveraging candidate angles from multiple subarrays. The subarray-specific
branch networks are integrated with a shared regression module to effectively
eliminate pseudo-solutions and fuse true angles. Simulation results show that
the proposed CRLB-ratio-WF method achieves DOA sensing performance comparable
to CRLB-based methods, while significantly reducing the reliance on prior
knowledge. More notably, the proposed MBDNN has superior performance in low-SNR
ranges. At SNR $= -15$ dB, it achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in
estimation accuracy compared to CRLB-ratio-WF method.

Abstract: The quantity and quality of muscles are increasingly recognized as important

assessments, obtaining precise quantitative measurements of musculature remains
challenging. This study aimed to develop a publicly available model for muscle
segmentation in MRIs and demonstrate its applicability across various
anatomical locations and imaging sequences. A total of 362 MRIs from 160
patients at a single tertiary center (Duke University Health System, 2016-2020)
were included, with 316 MRIs from 114 patients used for model development. The
model was tested on two separate sets: one with 28 MRIs representing common
sequence types, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of
88.45%, and another with 18 MRIs featuring less frequent sequences and
abnormalities such as muscular atrophy, hardware, and significant noise,
achieving 86.21% DSC. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a fully
automated deep learning algorithm for segmenting muscles on MRI across diverse
settings. The public release of this model enables consistent, reproducible
research into the relationship between musculature and health.
