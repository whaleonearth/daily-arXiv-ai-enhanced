Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency.

Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be\nchallenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well\nretrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.\nRecently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has\ngained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to\ngenerate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs\nto create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous\nwork~\\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have\nthe potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is\nneeded to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the\nreliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs\nare used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we\nexamine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are\nused for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in\nevaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.\nWe further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects\nmodel. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation\nresults obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for\ne.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as\nsignificant in comparing relative system performance.

Many works aim to address this issue by\nremoving redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on\nattention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use\nsimilarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently\ncausing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or\nsimilarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,\nwhich maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define\nthe conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the\ninstruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal\npoint process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected\nsubset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing\neasy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs\nshow that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language\nbenchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected\nsubset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user\ninstructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction\nratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\\% and CUDA latency\nby 78\\%, while maintaining 94\\% of the original accuracy.

To overcome these\nobstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient\nmulti-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus\ncreating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text\ninput. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the\nDirector Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip\ngeneration, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent\nfor editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical\ncomponents: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to\ngenerate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in\nReviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot\nanimation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level\nconsistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering\neach clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments\ndemonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular\nmetrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while\nsignificantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing\nAI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Furthermore, Farseer provides\nnew insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced\ndemands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an\nextensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and\nconfigurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours.

While function spaces are\ntypically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced\nthrough applications in computer vision and natural language processing that\nfocus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental\ndisparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from\nachieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in\nother fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural\nnetworks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate\ndeep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,\nneural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,\nphysical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and\ngeometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful\nengineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.\nTranslating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator\nlearning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural\noperator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not\ndirectly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In\nthis paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing\npractical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function\nspaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several\npopular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.\nThis paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the\nsteps to make neural operators work in practice.

Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)\nloss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when\nusing the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy\nLV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the\nlog-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward\nprocesses, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when\ndiffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for\ndiffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that\ncan be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our\nanalysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick\n(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently\noutperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion\nbridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD\nloss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that\nrKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more\nstable training behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
