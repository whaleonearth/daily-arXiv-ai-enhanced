Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a quantitative circuit-level analysis of diffusion models,
establishing computational pathways and mechanistic principles underlying image
generation processes. Through systematic intervention experiments across 2,000
synthetic and 2,000 CelebA facial images, we discover fundamental algorithmic
differences in how diffusion architectures process synthetic versus
naturalistic data distributions. Our investigation reveals that real-world face
processing requires circuits with measurably higher computational complexity
(complexity ratio = 1.084 plus/minus 0.008, p < 0.001), exhibiting distinct
attention specialization patterns with entropy divergence ranging from 0.015 to
0.166 across denoising timesteps. We identify eight functionally distinct
attention mechanisms showing specialized computational roles: edge detection
(entropy = 3.18 plus/minus 0.12), texture analysis (entropy = 4.16 plus/minus
0.08), and semantic understanding (entropy = 2.67 plus/minus 0.15).
Intervention analysis demonstrates critical computational bottlenecks where
targeted ablations produce 25.6% to 128.3% performance degradation, providing
causal evidence for identified circuit functions. These findings establish
quantitative foundations for algorithmic understanding and control of
generative model behavior through mechanistic intervention strategies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation faces practical challenges due to the
computational complexity and deployment limitations of large-scale
transformer-based models. To address this, we propose a novel Structure- and
Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation framework, named SRKD, that transfers
rich geometric and semantic knowledge from a large frozen teacher model (>100M)
to a lightweight student model (<15M). Specifically, we propose an affinity
matrix-based relation alignment module, which distills structural dependencies
from the teacher to the student through point-wise similarity matching,
enhancing the student's capability to learn contextual interactions. Meanwhile,
we introduce a cross-sample mini-batch construction strategy that enables the
student to perceive stable and generalized geometric structure. This aligns
across diverse point cloud instances of the teacher, rather than within a
single sample. Additionally, KL divergence is applied to align semantic
distributions, and ground-truth supervision further reinforces accurate
segmentation. Our method achieves state of the art performance with
significantly reduced model complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness and
efficiency in real-world deployment scenarios. Our Code is available at
https://github.com/itsnotacie/SRKD.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and
localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the
region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost
thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability
and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil
maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying
vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a
vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil
maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a
geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural
representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for
multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random
Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping
applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost
Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better
to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is
critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.
These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for
fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling
and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will
be released at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Predicting user churn in non-subscription gig platforms, where disengagement
is implicit, poses unique challenges due to the absence of explicit labels and
the dynamic nature of user behavior. Existing methods often rely on aggregated
snapshots or static visual representations, which obscure temporal cues
critical for early detection. In this work, we propose a temporally-aware
computer vision framework that models user behavioral patterns as a sequence of
radar chart images, each encoding day-level behavioral features. By integrating
a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM, our architecture captures
both spatial and temporal patterns underlying churn behavior. Extensive
experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms classical models and ViT-based radar chart baselines, yielding
gains of 17.7 in F1 score, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, along with
improved interpretability. The framework's modular design, explainability
tools, and efficient deployment characteristics make it suitable for
large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig-economy platforms.

Abstract: By 2050, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 16 percent of the
global population. As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,
particularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80
percent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on
non-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable
devices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the
limitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or
mmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.
These limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,
including system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading
in WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based
methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving
Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.
First, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse
millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and
preprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real
bathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we
introduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch
for radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch
for vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,
P2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art
approaches. Code and pretrained models will be made available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs), embedded with frequent
real-time decision-making, will rely heavily on a large volume of multisource
and multimodal data. In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different
sources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors
or sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field
overwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To
fulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,
efficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and
data quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ
layer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework
aims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a
case study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that
partially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8
object detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and
LiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a
range of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task
orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is
expected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable,
and resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and
heterogeneous data streams. Code, data, and implementation details are publicly

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution
(SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of
hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along
bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the
SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the
efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate
operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In
particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can
learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information
using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive
dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate
block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral
reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative
spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a
three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for
hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content
reconstruction.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering
drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such
information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,
material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and
labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,
engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable
outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that
integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a
transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies
YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)
patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,
lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D
mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is
trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These
are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are
lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited
computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated
dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a
comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four
key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%
recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a
case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports
downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing
the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing
interpretation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Automating embryo viability prediction for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is
important but challenging due to the limited availability of labeled pregnancy
outcome data, as only a small fraction of embryos are labeled after transfer.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to
improve prediction. However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly
applicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo
time-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory
for conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and
many outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle
with semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to
address these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In
each stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing
memory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame
alignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each
video and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then
models relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles
long videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286
labeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared
to baselines, with limited computational resources.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is typically
detected via screening programs where healthy people are invited in regular
intervals. Automated risk prediction approaches have the potential to improve
this process by facilitating dynamically screening of high-risk groups. While
most models focus solely on the most recent screening, there is growing
interest in exploiting temporal information to capture evolving trends in
breast tissue, as inspired by clinical practice. Early methods typically relied
on two time steps, and although recent efforts have extended this to multiple
time steps using Transformer architectures, challenges remain in fully
harnessing the rich temporal dynamics inherent in longitudinal imaging data. In
this work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a
state-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture
nuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we
incorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector
(SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant
bilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable
improvements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging
high-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time
points (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early
breast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views
enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe
under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address
these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional
UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model.
Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance
global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features,
querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight
attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior
baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views.
Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric
coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest
neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT,
provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on
LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating
the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based
geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things technologies and
the widespread adoption of 5G wireless networks have led to an exponential
increase in the number of radiation devices operating in complex
electromagnetic environments. A key challenge in managing and securing these
devices is accurate identification and classification. To address this
challenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a
promising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of
identifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner.
This research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum
analysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from
RF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample
containing 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples
across the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling
framework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning
methods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for
learning the identification of RF devices based on their transient
characteristics. The proposed approach provided a 10-fold cross-validation
performance with a precision of 99.33%, recall of 99.53%, F1-score of 99.43%,
and classification accuracy of 99.17%. The results demonstrate the promising
classification performance of the CNN-Bi-GRU approach, indicating its
suitability for accurately identifying RF devices based on their transient
characteristics and its potential for enhancing device identification and
classification in complex wireless environments.

Abstract: Robust visual recognition in underwater environments remains a significant

This paper introduces AQUA20, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising
8,171 underwater images across 20 marine species reflecting real-world

providing a valuable resource for underwater visual understanding. Thirteen
state-of-the-art deep learning models, including lightweight CNNs (SqueezeNet,
MobileNetV2) and transformer-based architectures (ViT, ConvNeXt), were
evaluated to benchmark their performance in classifying marine species under
challenging conditions. Our experimental results show ConvNeXt achieving the
best performance, with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.82% and a Top-1 accuracy of
90.69%, as well as the highest overall F1-score of 88.92% with moderately large
parameter size. The results obtained from our other benchmark models also
demonstrate trade-offs between complexity and performance. We also provide an
extensive explainability analysis using GRAD-CAM and LIME for interpreting the
strengths and pitfalls of the models. Our results reveal substantial room for
improvement in underwater species recognition and demonstrate the value of
AQUA20 as a foundation for future research in this domain. The dataset is

### [14] [Distributed Poisson multi-Bernoulli filtering via generalised covariance intersection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18397)
*Ángel F. García-Fernández,Giorgio Battistelli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a distributed Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter using the generalised covariance intersection (GCI) fusion rule, approximating PMB densities to achieve a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) that maintains closed-form expressions and improves performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distributed multi-object filtering where exact GCI fusion of PMB densities is intractable, the paper aims to develop a principled approximation method that enables efficient and accurate fusion while maintaining mathematical tractability.

Method: The method involves approximating the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, leading to the GCI fusion rule being the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities. This results in a PMBM that can be expressed in closed form, with future prediction and update steps preserving the PMBM form until it is projected back to a PMB density for the next fusion.

Result: The approach yields a PMBM filter that maintains closed-form expressions through prediction and update steps, with experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness and benefits compared to other distributed multi-object filters.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed distributed PMB filter based on GCI fusion with PMBM approximation offers a tractable and efficient solution for multi-object filtering, showing improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper presents the distributed Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter
based on the generalised covariance intersection (GCI) fusion rule for
distributed multi-object filtering. Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB
densities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically,
we approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which
corresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule
corresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities. We
show that the result is a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM), which can be
expressed in closed form. Future prediction and update steps in each filter
preserve the PMBM form, which can be projected back to a PMB density before the
next fusion step. Experimental results show the benefits of this approach
compared to other distributed multi-object filters.

Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods for autonomous driving prioritize accuracy over response time, but quick response is crucial in time-sensitive scenarios.

Method: A multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event cameras with image data from RGB cameras, using an asynchronous Graph Neural Network for temporal resolution and a CNN for spatial features.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods in accuracy and response time, achieving millisecond-level real-time performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Combining event and RGB cameras through the proposed hybrid network effectively captures temporal and spatial dynamics, enabling efficient real-time anomaly detection for safer autonomous driving.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous
driving systems. Current methods often focus on detection accuracy but neglect
response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving,
prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel
multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event
cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high
temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural
Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB
images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and
spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach
outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving
millisecond-level real-time performance.

Motivation: Traditional PSD analyses are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly, so there's a need for a more efficient method like optical grain size analysis integrated into geotechnical workflows.

Method: The authors collected 321 soil samples, photographed them in standardized top-view positions with 45 MP resolution and 39.4 micrometers per pixel scale, both moist and dry, using a custom test bench with white aluminum trays. They also used coning and quartering for larger samples.

Result: The result is a comprehensive dataset of soil images with corresponding PSD analysis, suitable for training CNNs in geotechnical applications.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a robust foundation for developing CNNs to improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of grain size analysis in geotechnical labs.

Abstract: Traditional particle size distribution (PSD) analyses create significant

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image
analysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding
rich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of
modality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful
results, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions.
However, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the
distribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain.
First, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that
breaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world
scenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional
validation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly
data-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and
introduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our
extensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates
that current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating
under realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot
inference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively
blends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the
proposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in
challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented
transfer capabilities and are being increasingly adopted for data-efficient
image classification. Despite its growing popularity, its reliability aspect
remains largely unexplored. This work explores the split conformal prediction
(SCP) framework to provide trustworthiness guarantees when transferring such
models based on a small labeled calibration set. Despite its potential, the
generalist nature of the VLMs' pre-training could negatively affect the
properties of the predicted conformal sets for specific tasks. While common
practice in transfer learning for discriminative purposes involves an
adaptation stage, we observe that deploying such a solution for conformal
purposes is suboptimal since adapting the model using the available calibration
data breaks the rigid exchangeability assumptions for test data in SCP. To
address this issue, we propose transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T),
a novel pipeline for transfer learning on conformal scenarios, which performs
an unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data.
We present comprehensive experiments utilizing medical VLMs across various
image modalities, transfer tasks, and non-conformity scores. Our framework
offers consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP,
maintaining the same empirical guarantees.

Abstract: Despite its importance for performance and injury prevention, golf swing
analysis is limited by isolated metrics, underrepresentation of professional
athletes, and a lack of rich, interpretable movement representations. We
address these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf
swing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of
professional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D
kinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate
synthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment
swing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete
vocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and
visualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player
identity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body
kinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion
analysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement
patterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement
signatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled
performance. Longitudinal tracking demonstrates practical value: as one
player's handicap improved from 50 to 2.2 over 1.5 years, our system captured
measurable technical progress and provided targeted, actionable feedback. Our
findings challenge common assumptions, such as swing consistency across clubs
and the existence of a single "ideal" swing, and uncover latent biomarkers
shaped by both intrinsic traits and task-specific constraints. This work
bridges lab and field-based biomechanics, offering scalable, accessible,
high-fidelity motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention,
while opening new directions in movement-based phenotyping, personalized
equipment design, and motor skill development.

Abstract: Currently, utilizing large language models to understand the 3D world is
becoming popular. Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output
bounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are
made, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object
proposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to
reason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by
pairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding
pipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video
and select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the
subsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D
bounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce
pixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby
eliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine
geometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question
answering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training
pipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D
point-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on
multiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales. These
results show that reinforcement-learning-based reasoning combined with RGB-D
video alone offers a practical, annotation-efficient route to trustworthy 3D
scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of evaluating whether capsule networks actually learn part-whole hierarchies when trained on supervised tasks like object classification, which makes it hard to assess their true capability in this area.

Method: The method involves creating SynDaCaTE, a synthetic dataset for testing and evaluating capsules, and using it to analyze existing models and test permutation-equivariant self-attention for parts-to-wholes inference.

Result: The result shows a precise bottleneck in a prominent capsule model and that permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes inference.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that SynDaCaTE is a useful dataset for evaluating capsule networks, and the findings motivate future work on effective inductive biases for computer vision.

Abstract: Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole
hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in
pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and
robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies,
often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on
supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult
to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole
hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic
DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and
establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a
prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that
permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes
inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive
biases for computer vision.

Abstract: Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the
end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning
followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various
complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary
significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms,
representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for
researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components
to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different
planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and
training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture
series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive
suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and
deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and
real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results
demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally
better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm
generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on
task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and
continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference
speeds.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation
(MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report
pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these
data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding
model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address
this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated
Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of
LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge
of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.
To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication
overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently
decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs
and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.
Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:
varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse
reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further
enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,
coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally
generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder
that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in
reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our
established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and
adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center
data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication
efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HalluRNN, an architecture-level solution to reduce hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by using a Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module that enhances model stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address hallucinations in LVLMs, which are textually plausible but visually ungrounded outputs, without requiring substantial resources or task-specific configurations.

Method: The method involves introducing HalluRNN with a DG-DPU module that is shared across layers and recurrently refines hidden states to enhance stability and reduce hallucinations.

Result: The result shows that HalluRNN achieves strong and robust performance across multiple benchmarks by fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that HalluRNN provides an effective architecture-level solution to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs through adaptive information propagation and consistency enforcement across layers.

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various tasks, they are still prone to
hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually
ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through
data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often
require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we
introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model
stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a
novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across
layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive
propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across
layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By
fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust
performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like
pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in
urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for
fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing
benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical
situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark
constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline.
DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding
boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores,
expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion
summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four
interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection,
intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference
baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that
mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene
graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses
risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by
a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing
performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment,
especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Face identity provides a powerful signal for deepfake detection. Prior
studies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn
identity features implicitly. This has led to conflicting views: some suppress
identity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence.
To reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity
alone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity
features generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm
that identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations
preserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm
generalization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly
suppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively
controlled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \textbf{SELFI}
(\textbf{SEL}ective \textbf{F}usion of \textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable
detection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists
of: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity
embeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a
forgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware
Fusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features
using a relevance-guided fusion mechanism. Experiments on four benchmarks show
that SELFI improves cross-manipulation generalization, outperforming prior
methods by an average of 3.1\% AUC. On the challenging DFDC dataset, SELFI
exceeds the previous best by 6\%. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by its incurable nature, rapid
progression, and severe disability, poses significant challenges to the lives
of patients and their families. Given the aging population, the need for early
detection of PD is increasing. In vitro diagnosis has garnered attention due to
its non-invasive nature and low cost. However, existing methods present several
challenges: 1) limited training data for facial expression diagnosis; 2)
specialized equipment and acquisition environments required for gait diagnosis,
resulting in poor generalizability; 3) the risk of misdiagnosis or missed
diagnosis when relying on a single modality. To address these issues, we
propose a novel multimodal in vitro diagnostic method for PD, leveraging facial
expressions and behavioral gait. Our method employs a lightweight deep learning
model for feature extraction and fusion, aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy
and facilitating deployment on mobile devices. Furthermore, we have established
the largest multimodal PD dataset in collaboration with a hospital and
conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop an age prediction model which is interpretable and robust
to demographic and technological variances in brain MRI scans. Materials and
Methods: We propose a transformer-based architecture that leverages
self-supervised pre-training on large-scale datasets. Our model processes
pseudo-3D T1-weighted MRI scans from three anatomical views and incorporates
brain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduce the
conventional quadratic complexity of transformer models to linear complexity,
enabling scalability for high-dimensional MRI data. We trained our model on
ADNI2 $\&$ 3 (N=1348) and OASIS3 (N=716) datasets (age range: 42 - 95) from the
North America, with an 8:1:1 split for train, validation and test. Then, we
validated it on the AIBL dataset (N=768, age range: 60 - 92) from Australia.
Results: We achieved an MAE of 3.65 years on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 and OASIS3 test set
and a high generalizability of MAE of 3.54 years on AIBL. There was a notable
increase in brain age gap (BAG) across cognitive groups, with mean of 0.15
years (95% CI: [-0.22, 0.51]) in CN, 2.55 years ([2.40, 2.70]) in MCI, 6.12
years ([5.82, 6.43]) in AD. Additionally, significant negative correlation
between BAG and cognitive scores was observed, with correlation coefficient of
-0.185 (p < 0.001) for MoCA and -0.231 (p < 0.001) for MMSE. Gradient-based
feature attribution highlighted ventricles and white matter structures as key
regions influenced by brain aging. Conclusion: Our model effectively fused
information from different views and volumetric information to achieve
state-of-the-art brain age prediction accuracy, improved generalizability and
interpretability with association to neurodegenerative disorders.

Motivation: The motivation is to reduce computational costs associated with using large image encoders like ViT for high-resolution features in multimodal models, without compromising performance.

Method: The method involves developing a shallow feature enricher as an alternative to multiple calls of large image encoders, leveraging feature upsampling for high-resolution feature generation.

Result: The results show that the shallow feature enricher achieves competitive performance with significant reductions in training/inference time and computational cost, up to 1.5x FLOPs saving.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that feature upsampling and shallow enrichers can effectively replace complex image encoders, offering efficiency gains while maintaining high performance in visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: The integration of high-resolution image features in modern multimodal large
language models has demonstrated significant improvements in fine-grained
visual understanding tasks, achieving high performance across multiple
benchmarks. Since these features are obtained from large image encoders like
ViT, they come with a significant increase in computational costs due to
multiple calls to these encoders. In this work, we first develop an intuition
for feature upsampling as a natural extension of high-resolution feature
generation. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we demonstrate how a
shallow feature enricher can achieve competitive results with tremendous
reductions in training and inference time as well as computational cost, with
upto 1.5x saving in FLOPs.

Abstract: Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling,

substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based
solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and
poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To
bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process
of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching
tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an
initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning
and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for
Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool
proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate
seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop
MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits.
JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and
fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new
avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a
60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content
fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form
instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and
spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising
potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of
complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term
egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs)
over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely
on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise
compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in
reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel
training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and
orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the
scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic
Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map
constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging
low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS,
especially in handling long-term visual dependencies. Code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene understanding in
vision-based systems like autonomous driving. However, recent studies show that
SDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to
unrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in
static scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a
critical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and
transferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?
  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified
attack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages
of stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost
aggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation
across 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,
reveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.
Interestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather
than pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated
by this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch
attack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement
learning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to
disrupt SDE assumptions.
  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA
simulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses
optimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly
better black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions
like low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4),
whereas optimization-based methods fail.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples
to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing
unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for
training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we
target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em
labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much
more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot
OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In
this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive
Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter-
and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity
of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images,
engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first
generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and
label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for
each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a
prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD
prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art
works.

Abstract: Automating medical report generation from histopathology images is a critical
challenge requiring effective visual representations and domain-specific
knowledge. Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an
in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived
from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism.
Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image
(WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual
relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the
framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements
across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across
diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data
utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution
for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future
advancements in multimodal clinical applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDSAM, a training-free method to reduce hallucinations in large vision-language models by dynamically refining attention to image tokens during decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LVLMs arise from sensitivity to image tokens during decoding, causing issues with generating accurate entities. The goal is to address this without additional training or external tools.

Method: MDSAM uses a memory-driven sparse attention matrix that captures and refines attention patterns to image tokens at each layer, using alignment to activate updates during decoding.

Result: Evaluated on image captioning and visual question answering benchmarks, MDSAM consistently reduces hallucinations and improves reliability.

Conclusion: MDSAM is adaptable to various LVLM architectures and effective in reducing hallucinations without needing extra training or tools.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often stem from the
model's sensitivity to image tokens during decoding, as evidenced by attention
peaks observed when generating both real and hallucinated entities. To address
this, we propose Memory-Driven Sparse Attention Matrix (MDSAM) , a novel
training-free approach that dynamically captures and refines the attention
allocated to image tokens at each layer. MDSAM memorizes attention patterns and
activates updates through alignment during decoding, enhancing focus on
relevant image tokens while effectively reducing hallucinations. We evaluate
MDSAM on multiple benchmarks for tasks such as image captioning and visual
question answering, demonstrating its ability to consistently reduce
hallucinations and improve reliability. Compatible with various LVLM
architectures, MDSAM highlights its adaptability and effectiveness in
mitigating hallucinations without requiring additional training or external
tools.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the cornerstone of target
detection, but they are often limited by limited receptive fields, which
hinders their ability to capture global contextual information. This paper
believes that the effective utilization of extracted features is as important
as the feature extraction process itself. We critically re-evaluated the
DETR-inspired header network architecture, questioning the indispensable nature
of its self-attention mechanism, and discovering significant information
redundancies. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated
Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header
inspired by natural language processing architecture and human visual
perception. CSDN aims to efficiently utilize the characteristics of the CNN
backbone network by replacing the traditional stacked self-attention and
cross-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism enables
each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature
dimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns. CSDN
provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better
adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head
can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only
a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-training weights can significantly
improve the detection accuracy, thus avoiding the need to achieve small
improvements. Various layer modules undergo extensive re-training.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recognizing human activities from visual inputs, particularly through a
first-person viewpoint, is essential for enabling robots to replicate human
behavior. Egocentric vision, characterized by cameras worn by observers,
captures diverse changes in illumination, viewpoint, and environment. This
variability leads to a notable drop in the performance of Egocentric Action
Recognition models when tested in environments not seen during training. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a domain generalization
approach for Egocentric Action Recognition. Our insight is that action
sequences often reflect consistent user intent across visual domains. By
leveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization
ability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG,
introduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses
contextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central
action of the sequence. Additionally, we enhance the model's robustness by
training it on mixed sequences of actions from different domains (SeqMix). We
validate SeqDG on the EGTEA and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets. Results on
EPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement
in cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the
model achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action
recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is efficient and robust to missing modalities, offering a scalable solution for audiovisual speaker verification.

Abstract: Conventional audio-visual methods for speaker verification rely on large
amounts of labeled data and separate modality-specific architectures, which is
computationally expensive, limiting their scalability. To address these
problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive
learning with asymmetric masking and masked data modeling to obtain robust
audiovisual feature representations. In particular, we employ a unified
framework for self-supervised audiovisual speaker verification using a single
shared backbone for audio and visual inputs, leveraging the versatility of
vision transformers. The proposed unified framework can handle audio, visual,
or audiovisual inputs using a single shared vision transformer backbone during
training and testing while being computationally efficient and robust to
missing modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance without labeled data while reducing computational costs

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Perpetual view generation aims to synthesize a long-term video corresponding
to an arbitrary camera trajectory solely from a single input image. Recent
methods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to
synthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.
However, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in
distorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static
3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.
To alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that
leverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a
new perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object
dynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to
3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera
trajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to
complete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,
producing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera
trajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early
stopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and
improve visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal
large language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in
current view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with
object movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual
dynamic scene view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our DreamJourney over state-of-the-art methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page:

Abstract: We present Programmable-Room, a framework which interactively generates and

of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler
steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating
panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the
coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support
the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual
programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to
write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for
the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules.
Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained
large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and
visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously.
Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing
the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained
from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in
generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to
an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively. Project page is available

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of Pelvic Radiation Injury (PRI) from Magnetic
Resonance Images (MRI) is crucial for more precise prognosis assessment and the
development of personalized treatment plans. However, automated segmentation
remains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and
confusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern
Divide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to
use different network modules to "divide" various local and global patterns
and, through flexible feature selection, to "conquer" the Regions of Interest
(ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often
manifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce
a Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's
ability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four
distinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing
context, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module
explicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the
dataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns
associated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an
Adaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different
patterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating
the final segmentation results. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale
pelvic radiation injury dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of
our PDC-Net over existing approaches.

Abstract: The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to
their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the
convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based
self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information
aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to
capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection
performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an
accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned
challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement
(HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations
and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to
pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving
efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement.
Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD)
paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information
flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing
correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to
leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel
convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce
parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N
improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and

Abstract: Transforming static images into interactive experiences remains a challenging

Current approaches aim to achieve this either using pre-recorded video

PhysID, that streamlines the creation of physics-based interactive dynamics
from a single-view image by leveraging large generative models for 3D mesh
generation and physical property prediction. This significantly reduces the
expertise required for engineering-intensive tasks like 3D modeling and
intrinsic property calibration, enabling the process to be scaled with minimal
manual intervention. We integrate an on-device physics-based engine for
physically plausible real-time rendering with user interactions. PhysID
represents a leap forward in mobile-based interactive dynamics, offering
real-time, non-deterministic interactions and user-personalization with
efficient on-device memory consumption. Experiments evaluate the zero-shot
capabilities of various Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse
tasks and the performance of 3D reconstruction models. These results
demonstrate the cohesive functioning of all modules within the end-to-end
framework, contributing to its effectiveness.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality of spectral data, significant inter-band redundancy, and the
limited availability of annotated samples. While recent transformer-based
models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies,
their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain
limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation
Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision
transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient
architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery.
Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local
window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and
spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve
adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and
projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable
parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation
strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and
Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters
and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework
provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications
in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics. Our

Result: Experimental results show that FairMoE achieves substantial accuracy improvements compared to previous fairness approaches while maintaining comparable fairness metrics.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that FairMoE provides an effective alternative to existing bias mitigation methods by incorporating sensitive attributes and dynamically routing data, leading to better accuracy and fairness in skin disease diagnostics.

Abstract: AI-based systems have achieved high accuracy in skin disease diagnostics but
often exhibit biases across demographic groups, leading to inequitable
healthcare outcomes and diminished patient trust. Most existing bias mitigation
methods attempt to eliminate the correlation between sensitive attributes and
diagnostic prediction, but those methods often degrade performance due to the
lost of clinically relevant diagnostic cues. In this work, we propose an
alternative approach that incorporates sensitive attributes to achieve
fairness. We introduce FairMoE, a framework that employs layer-wise
mixture-of-experts modules to serve as group-specific learners. Unlike
traditional methods that rigidly assign data based on group labels, FairMoE
dynamically routes data to the most suitable expert, making it particularly
effective for handling cases near group boundaries. Experimental results show
that, unlike previous fairness approaches that reduce performance, FairMoE
achieves substantial accuracy improvements while preserving comparable fairness

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables generalization to new tasks with minimal
labeled data. However, mainstream ICL approaches rely on a gridding strategy,
which lacks the flexibility required for vision applications. We introduce
Temporal, a time-contrastive self-supervised objective that pretrains a prompt
retriever for visual ICL, and formulate ICL as a video object segmentation
(VOS) task. Temporal addresses key limitations of grid-based methods that
restrict the number and resolution of context images. By reframing ICL as a VOS
problem, our approach supports a variable number of context images while
preserving their full resolution. To address the challenge of selecting optimal
context sets for queries, we pretrain a prompt retriever on videos via
self-supervised learning, where adjacent frames serve as positives and distant
frames as negatives. For image segmentation, the prompt retriever selects
relevant sequences that, when combined with the query, form coherent videos for
VOS processing. For video segmentation, it identifies keyframes, predicts their
masks using our ICL pipeline, and propagates them throughout the sequence. When
evaluated on MICCAI FLARE 2022, our method achieves substantial improvements
over baselines: 90.95% Dice score for image segmentation (10.64% improvement)
and 92.45% Dice for video segmentation (14.88% improvement).

Abstract: This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a
novel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In
order to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under
undesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,
it is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low
frame rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two
limitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and
background components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture
either data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not
include explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS
process. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based
foreground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures
scattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex
optimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general
features, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of
noise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and
general features to accurately separate the components from various types of
noise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization
problem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex
subproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded
videos: infrared and microscope videos.

Abstract: Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics
and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on
anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body
structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of
full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but
complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address
these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model
based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm
iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the
canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts
and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface
observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on
segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$
subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and
provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated
anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from
segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our
method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size.
To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal
body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in
prenatal diagnostics. The code is available at

Abstract: The integration of RGB and thermal data can significantly improve semantic
segmentation performance in wild environments for field robots. Nevertheless,
multi-source data processing (e.g. Transformer-based approaches) imposes
significant computational overhead, presenting challenges for
resource-constrained systems. To resolve this critical limitation, we
introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture
leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework
comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal
2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal
modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden
state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a
cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates
global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through
convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM
achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution.
Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Further
experiments on the PST900 dataset demonstrate its generalizability. Codes are

there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video

holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures.
Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage

Abstract: The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging
protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices.
Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these
color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain
normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color
discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and
vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the
target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to
normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by
different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this
assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color
features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention
mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color
(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of
stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to
select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection
algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain

Conclusion: The Cloud-Attentive Reconstruction Framework is effective for generating cloud-free optical satellite imagery, which can improve applications reliant on clear optical data.

Abstract: Cloud contamination significantly impairs the usability of optical satellite
imagery, affecting critical applications such as environmental monitoring,
disaster response, and land-use analysis. This research presents a
Cloud-Attentive Reconstruction Framework that integrates SAR-optical feature
fusion with deep learning-based image reconstruction to generate cloud-free
optical imagery. The proposed framework employs an attention-driven feature
fusion mechanism to align complementary structural information from Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) with spectral characteristics from optical data.
Furthermore, a cloud-aware model update strategy introduces adaptive loss
weighting to prioritize cloud-occluded regions, enhancing reconstruction
accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
existing approaches, achieving a PSNR of 31.01 dB, SSIM of 0.918, and MAE of
0.017. These outcomes highlight the framework's effectiveness in producing
high-fidelity, spatially and spectrally consistent cloud-free optical images.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a
scene, representing them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic
labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention
due to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods
primarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features
and query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the
internal relationships among scene features as well as between query features.
In light of these disadvantages, we propose \textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing
Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}. Specifically, we
introduce an adaptive superpoint aggregation module and a contrastive
learning-guided superpoint refinement module to better represent superpoint
features (scene features) and leverage contrastive learning to guide the
updates of these features. Furthermore, our relation-aware self-attention
mechanism enhances the capabilities of modeling relationships between queries
by incorporating positional and geometric relationships into the self-attention
mechanism. Extensive experiments on the ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, ScanNet200 and
S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Relation3D.

Abstract: Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry,
widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is
much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors
affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks.
Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is
catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with
machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However,
existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic
data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine
learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first
sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and
BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate
usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with
triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning
for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the
availability and effectiveness of our dataset. Besides, they also show that our
baseline is obviously superior to other similar detection methods. Our datasets

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Egocentric vision is essential for both human and machine visual
understanding, particularly in capturing the detailed hand-object interactions
needed for manipulation tasks. Translating third-person views into first-person
views significantly benefits augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and
robotics applications. However, current exocentric-to-egocentric translation
methods are limited by their dependence on 2D cues, synchronized multi-view
settings, and unrealistic assumptions such as necessity of initial egocentric
frame and relative camera poses during inference. To overcome these challenges,
we introduce EgoWorld, a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs an
egocentric view from rich exocentric observations, including projected point
clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions. Our approach reconstructs a
point cloud from estimated exocentric depth maps, reprojects it into the
egocentric perspective, and then applies diffusion-based inpainting to produce
dense, semantically coherent egocentric images. Evaluated on the H2O and TACO
datasets, EgoWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates
robust generalization to new objects, actions, scenes, and subjects. Moreover,
EgoWorld shows promising results even on unlabeled real-world examples.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they often suffer
from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors
that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address
these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment
framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and
mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal
grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred
object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for
the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual
evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection
mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from
non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding
side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's
reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are
conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench
showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and
hallucination suppression.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Existing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) models often suffer from
language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer
categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates
three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous
Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and
Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating
language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO
employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve
heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster
synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality
to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect
side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive
weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer
categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e.,
imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional
and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO
over state-of-the-art competitors.

Result: The authors describe their preliminary experimentation and results, though specific outcomes are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper outlines the proposed pipeline, presents initial results, and provides a roadmap for future development to transition the system into production.

Abstract: 2D cameras are often used in interactive systems. Other systems like gaming
consoles provide more powerful 3D cameras for short range depth sensing.
Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this
work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems,
that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust
scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full
scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like
event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback
approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the
environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new
environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our
preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the
next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in
many multimodal generation tasks, but a significant performance gap still
exists in text-to-motion generation, where LLM-based methods lag far behind
non-LLM methods. We identify the granularity of motion tokenization as a
critical bottleneck: fine-grained tokenization induces local dependency issues,
where LLMs overemphasize short-term coherence at the expense of global semantic
alignment, while coarse-grained tokenization sacrifices motion details. To
resolve this issue, we propose PlanMoGPT, an LLM-based framework integrating
progressive planning and flow-enhanced fine-grained motion tokenization. First,
our progressive planning mechanism leverages LLMs' autoregressive capabilities
to hierarchically generate motion tokens by starting from sparse global plans
and iteratively refining them into full sequences. Second, our flow-enhanced
tokenizer doubles the downsampling resolution and expands the codebook size by
eight times, minimizing detail loss during discretization, while a
flow-enhanced decoder recovers motion nuances. Extensive experiments on
text-to-motion benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving FID scores by 63.8% (from 0.380 to 0.141) on
long-sequence generation while enhancing motion diversity by 49.9% compared to
existing methods. The proposed framework successfully resolves the
diversity-quality trade-off that plagues current non-LLM approaches,
establishing new standards for text-to-motion generation.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for
natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain
alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input
space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align
different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification
problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture
uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of
feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features.
Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously
selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This
tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural
images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a
multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only
enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up
training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than
state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and
VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.

Abstract: Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by
enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images.
While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved
performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and
poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to
understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first
proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer
generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly
ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing
fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable
reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving
the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer.
Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of
the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposal. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is widely used in a variety of fields such as
urban planning, terrain and geomorphology analysis, and environmental
monitoring, mainly by analyzing the significant change differences of features
(e.g., building changes) in the same spatial region at different time phases.
In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) augmented inference

textual descriptive information and aims at guiding the model to segment the
more interested change regions, thus accelerating the convergence speed.
Moreover, we design a spatial transformation module (BEV) based on linear
attention, which solves the problem of modal misalignment in change detection
by unifying features from different temporal perspectives onto the BEV space.
In addition, we construct the first dataset for building change detection from
UAV viewpoints (DVCD ), and our experiments on four widely-used change
detection datasets show a significant improvement over existing methods. The

Abstract: This research paper proposes an improved deep learning model for classifying
tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
with EfficientNetB0. This is a critical task for market organization with a
tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient.
Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their
unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated
classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more
than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have
been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific
tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by
training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to
generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on
Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall,
F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models
comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification
performance.
  The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and
EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of
transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the
confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each
model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as
EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and
generalization.

Abstract: This paper presents a newly developed mobile application designed to diagnose

Traditional TST methods often suffer from low follow-up return rates, patient
discomfort, and subjective manual interpretation, particularly with the
ball-point pen method, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Moreover,
previous developed mobile applications that used 3D reconstruction, this app
utilizes scaling stickers as reference objects for induration measurement. This
mobile application integrates advanced image processing technologies, including
ARCore, and machine learning algorithms such as DeepLabv3 for robust image
segmentation and precise measurement of skin indurations indicative of LTBI.
The system employs an edge detection algorithm to enhance accuracy. The
application was evaluated against standard clinical practices, demonstrating
significant improvements in accuracy and reliability. This innovation is
crucial for effective tuberculosis management, especially in resource-limited
regions. By automating and standardizing TST evaluations, the application
enhances the accessibility and efficiency of TB di-agnostics. Future work will

expanding functionalities to include comprehensive patient data management, and

Abstract: LiDAR and 4D radar are widely used in autonomous driving and robotics. While
LiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement
and remains robust under adverse conditions. As a result, increasing studies
have focused on the 4D radar-LiDAR fusion method to enhance the perception.
However, the misalignment between different modalities is often overlooked. To
address this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we
propose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and
cross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first
captured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction
to enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties
of bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and
refine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft
(VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving
state-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and
88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of
images based on human subjective perception. Existing methods generally combine
multiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on
straightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately
capture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we
propose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images
and text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts
the impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics. Specifically, we
utilize an encoder to extract multiscale features from the input image and
introduce a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module designed to capture the
relationships between shallow and deep features. In addition, by incorporating
40 image quality adjectives across six distinct dimensions, we enable the
pre-trained CLIP text encoder to generate representations of the intrinsic
quality of the image, thereby strengthening the connection between image
quality perception and human language. Our method achieves superior results on
most public Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA benchmarks, while
demonstrating greater robustness.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Synthetic data has recently reached a level of visual fidelity that makes it
nearly indistinguishable from real data, offering great promise for
privacy-preserving data sharing in medical imaging. However, fully synthetic
datasets still suffer from significant limitations: First and foremost, the
legal aspect of sharing synthetic data is often neglected and data regulations,
such as the GDPR, are largley ignored. Secondly, synthetic models fall short of
matching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream
applications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising
image diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and
therefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift
perspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as
protecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate
singling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a
generalisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which
leads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one
percentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy. Our code is available at

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is commonly used for Oil Spill Detection (OSD) in
remote sensing images. However, the limited availability of labelled oil spill
samples and class imbalance present significant challenges that can reduce
detection accuracy. Furthermore, most existing methods, which rely on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to detect small oil spill areas
due to their limited receptive fields and inability to effectively capture
global contextual information. This study explores the potential of State-Space
Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, to overcome these limitations, building on
their recent success in vision applications. We propose OSDMamba, the first
Mamba-based architecture specifically designed for oil spill detection.
OSDMamba leverages Mamba's selective scanning mechanism to effectively expand
the model's receptive field while preserving critical details. Moreover, we
designed an asymmetric decoder incorporating ConvSSM and deep supervision to
strengthen multi-scale feature fusion, thereby enhancing the model's
sensitivity to minority class samples. Experimental results show that the
proposed OSDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding improvements
of 8.9% and 11.8% in OSD across two publicly available datasets.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has seen substantial advances in

images and natural distribution, far from practical scenarios with inevitable
distribution shifts. This hampers the practical applicability of HOI detection.
In this work, we investigate this issue by benchmarking, analyzing, and
enhancing the robustness of HOI detection models under various distribution
shifts. We start by proposing a novel automated approach to create the first
robustness evaluation benchmark for HOI detection. Subsequently, we evaluate
more than 40 existing HOI detection models on this benchmark, showing their
insufficiency, analyzing the features of different frameworks, and discussing
how the robustness in HOI is different from other tasks. With the insights from
such analyses, we propose to improve the robustness of HOI detection methods
through: (1) a cross-domain data augmentation integrated with mixup, and (2) a
feature fusion strategy with frozen vision foundation models. Both are simple,
plug-and-play, and applicable to various methods. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly increases the robustness
of various methods, with benefits on standard benchmarks, too. The dataset and

Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in
histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents
critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often
dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle
to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional
spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering
(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and
strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by
clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with
cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional
intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which
dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via
feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating
semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate
semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo
integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while
enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive
experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Motivation: Motivation: Medical image segmentation needs better global understanding and local modeling, which LLMs can provide through their semantic awareness.

Method: Method: Proposed LLM4Seg combines a frozen LLM layer with a CNN encoder-decoder, allowing the LLM to process visual tokens without retraining.

Result: Result: The hybrid model improves segmentation performance across multiple modalities (ultrasound, dermoscopy, polypscopy, CT) with minimal parameter increases.

Conclusion: Conclusion: Transferring LLM's semantic knowledge boosts segmentation, suggesting potential for broader medical imaging applications.

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language
processing, this paper presents an intriguing finding: a frozen pre-trained LLM
layer can process visual tokens for medical image segmentation tasks.
Specifically, we propose a simple hybrid structure that integrates a
pre-trained, frozen LLM layer within the CNN encoder-decoder segmentation
framework (LLM4Seg). Surprisingly, this design improves segmentation
performance with a minimal increase in trainable parameters across various
modalities, including ultrasound, dermoscopy, polypscopy, and CT scans. Our
in-depth analysis reveals the potential of transferring LLM's semantic
awareness to enhance segmentation tasks, offering both improved global
understanding and better local modeling capabilities. The improvement proves
robust across different LLMs, validated using LLaMA and DeepSeek.

Abstract: Accurate automatic medical image segmentation relies on high-quality, dense
annotations, which are costly and time-consuming. Weakly supervised learning
provides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse
annotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance
degradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.
To address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised
cross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main
components: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature
learning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the
modality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning
network effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal
images, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation
performance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides
segmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and
inter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while
promoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting,
delivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both
challenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures. Extensive
experiments on a clinical cross-modal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) dataset
(including CT and MR imaging) and the publicly available CT Whole Abdominal
Organ dataset (WORD) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly
supervised methods. In addition, our approach also outperforms fully supervised
methods when full annotation is used. Our approach can facilitate clinical
therapy and benefit various specialists, including physicists, radiologists,
pathologists, and oncologists.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Small Vision Language Models (SVLMs) generally refer to models with parameter
sizes less than or equal to 2B. Their low cost and power consumption
characteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning
abilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental
Training Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we
constructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,
which leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original
data into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental
Training Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by
performing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT
data. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards
on the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training
on the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The
resulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4
addresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture
complex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture
space of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation
experiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the
reasoning ability of 1B SVLM. Compared to the baseline model fine-tuned on the
original data, accuracy increased by 2.77 and recall by 0.69, achieving
performance comparable to that of 8B models.

Abstract: Estimating three-dimensional morphological traits from two-dimensional RGB
images presents inherent challenges due to the loss of depth information,
projection distortions, and occlusions under field conditions. In this work, we
explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat
spikes, using RGB image sequences and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth
references. Due to the complex geometry of the spikes, we propose a neural
network approach for volume estimation in 2D images, employing a transfer
learning pipeline that combines DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer,
with a unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. By using deep
supervision, the model is able to learn more robust intermediate
representations, which enhances its generalisation ability across varying
evaluation sequences. We benchmark our model against two conventional
baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using
axis-aligned cross-sections. Our deep supervised model achieves a mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) of 6.46% on six-view indoor images, outperforming the
area (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines. Fine-tuning the model on
field-based single-image data enables domain adaptation, yielding a MAPE of
10.82%. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume
prediction accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing
greater challenges for geometric methods compared to our deep learning
approach.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image classification techniques are rapidly
advancing in medical image analysis, making it crucial to develop accurate and
trustworthy models that can be efficiently deployed across diverse clinical
scenarios. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of
explainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these
concepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image
classification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new
challenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in
imaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as
alterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training
requires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with
image-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and
faithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring
expert-annotated concept labels in medical domains. To address these
challenges, we propose a training-free confusion concept identification
strategy. By leveraging minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with only
image-level labels, our approach enhances out-of-domain performance without
sacrificing source domain accuracy through two key operations: masking
misactivated confounding concepts and amplifying under-activated discriminative
concepts. The efficacy of our method is validated on both skin and white blood
cell images. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning
textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal
models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in
poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative
MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering,
answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features
three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in
different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to
judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and
grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing
answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all
7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new
state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and
DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy
video-language understanding. Our code is available in

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) can advance assistive driving by exploring
inter-task correlations through shared representations. However, existing
methods face two critical limitations: single-modality constraints limiting
comprehensive scene understanding and inefficient architectures impeding
real-time deployment. This paper proposes TEM^3-Learning (Time-Efficient
Multimodal Multi-task Learning), a novel framework that jointly optimizes
driver emotion recognition, driver behavior recognition, traffic context
recognition, and vehicle behavior recognition through a two-stage architecture.
The first component, the mamba-based multi-view temporal-spatial feature
extraction subnetwork (MTS-Mamba), introduces a forward-backward temporal
scanning mechanism and global-local spatial attention to efficiently extract
low-cost temporal-spatial features from multi-view sequential images. The
second component, the MTL-based gated multimodal feature integrator (MGMI),
employs task-specific multi-gating modules to adaptively highlight the most
relevant modality features for each task, effectively alleviating the negative
transfer problem in MTL. Evaluation on the AIDE dataset, our proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across all four tasks, maintaining a
lightweight architecture with fewer than 6 million parameters and delivering an
impressive 142.32 FPS inference speed. Rigorous ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the independent
contributions of each module. The code is available on

remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we
present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and
46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image

Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model
capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o
not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor,
Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably,
it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from
scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8
A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will
foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised
learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a
potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to
unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites
a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful
representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we
investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable
VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training
techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global
semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities.
Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the
generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art
SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics
designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously
maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we
propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the
standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without
requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.

Abstract: Polyp detection is crucial for colorectal cancer screening, yet existing
models are limited by the scale and diversity of available data. While
generative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly
focus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of
false positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial
diffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive
variability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false
positive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First,
we design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis
space using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric
diffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses
exclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the
Detector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs
the negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision,
guiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value,
detector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds.
Our approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection,
establishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving
the way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening.
Extensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our
method over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving
the detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the
baselines. Codes are at https://github.com/Huster-Hq/DADA.

Abstract: Medical imaging diagnosis presents inherent challenges due to diseases that
mimic normal anatomy and exhibit significant inter-patient variability.
Clinicians routinely employ comparative reasoning-using reference images from
healthy controls or previous patient examinations-to discern subtle yet
diagnostically critical abnormalities. However, existing medical
vision-language models (VLMs) focus primarily on single-image or single-series
analyses and lack explicit mechanisms for comparative reasoning. Conversely,
general-purpose VLMs demonstrate strong multi-image comparative reasoning
capabilities but lack essential medical-domain knowledge to identify nuanced
clinical differences. This work aims to bridge this gap by exploring
clinically-inspired comparative analysis within VLMs, leveraging reference
images to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Through extensive empirical analysis, we
show that providing general-purpose VLMs with query and normative matched
reference images, accompanied by clinically-informed comparative prompts,
significantly improves diagnostic outcomes compared to single-image baselines,
especially after supervised finetuning (SFT). Our contributions highlight the
clinical relevance of comparative analysis introduce novel strategies for
leveraging reference images in VLMs, empirically demonstrate enhanced
performance across multiple medical visual question answering (VQA) tasks, and
provide theoretical insights into the efficacy of comparative image analysis in
medical diagnosis.

Abstract: This work investigates the feasibility of a post-processing-based approach
for phase separation in defocusing particle tracking velocimetry for dispersed
two-phase flows. The method enables the simultaneous 3D localization
determination of both tracer particles and particles of the dispersed phase,
using a single-camera setup. The distinction between phases is based on pattern
differences in defocused particle images, which arise from distinct light
scattering behaviors of tracer particles and bubbles or droplets. Convolutional
neural networks, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 variants, are trained to
detect and classify particle images based on these pattern features. To
generate large, labeled training datasets, a generative adversarial network
based framework is introduced, allowing the generation of auto-labeled data
that more closely reflects experiment-specific visual appearance. Evaluation
across six datasets, comprising synthetic two-phase and real single- and
two-phase flows, demonstrates high detection precision and classification
accuracy (95-100%), even under domain shifts. The results confirm the viability
of using CNNs for robust phase separation in disperse two-phase DPTV,
particularly in scenarios where traditional wavelength-, size-, or ensemble
correlation-based methods are impractical.

Abstract: Learning dense correspondences, critical for application such as video label

Self-supervised methods address this by using a cross-view pretext task, often
modeled with a masked autoencoder, where a masked target view is reconstructed
from an anchor view. However, acquiring effective training data remains a
challenge - collecting diverse video datasets is difficult and costly, while
simple image crops lack necessary pose variations. This paper introduces
CDG-MAE, a novel MAE-based self-supervised method that uses diverse synthetic
views generated from static images via an image-conditioned diffusion model.
These generated views exhibit substantial changes in pose and perspective,
providing a rich training signal that overcomes the limitations of video and
crop-based anchors. We present a quantitative method to evaluate local and
global consistency of generated images, discussing their use for cross-view
self-supervised pretraining. Furthermore, we enhance the standard single-anchor
MAE setting to a multi-anchor strategy to effectively modulate the difficulty
of pretext task. CDG-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MAE methods
reliant only on images and substantially narrows the performance gap to
video-based approaches.

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid
nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some
require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its
effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules,
causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College
of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been
developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by
interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to
improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal
and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global
information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this
work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid
Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel
representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine
clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a
pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms,
our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while
enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our
model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models,
achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1
score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign
nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model
has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient
outcomes.

Abstract: While deep learning-based architectures have been widely used for correctly
detecting and classifying plant diseases, they require large-scale datasets to
learn generalized features and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This poses
a challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying
leaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning
framework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease
classification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by
combining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting
the feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are
state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain
adapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping
classes with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are
then passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network
consisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10
classes of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving
promising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot,
10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7%
has been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than
state-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement.
The proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease
classification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in
single-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is particularly challenging in environments affected by noise,

algorithms can leverage multiple modalities to address these challenges, but
traditional optical flow-based visual SLAM approaches often require significant
computational resources.To overcome this limitation, we propose FMF-SLAM, an

Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to extract features
from RGB and depth signals. We further enhance the interaction of multimodal
features by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.
We also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world

fusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.
Our approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction
from sparse image collections. Recent work has explored integrating pre-trained
vision features, particularly from DINO, to enhance few-shot reconstruction
capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches remains unclear,
especially in extreme few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we present a
systematic evaluation of DINO-enhanced NeRF models, comparing baseline NeRF,
frozen DINO features, LoRA fine-tuned features, and multi-scale feature fusion.
Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that all DINO variants perform worse than
the baseline NeRF, achieving PSNR values around 12.9 to 13.0 compared to the
baseline's 14.71. This counterintuitive result suggests that pre-trained vision
features may not be beneficial for few-shot 3D reconstruction and may even
introduce harmful biases. We analyze potential causes including feature-task
mismatch, overfitting to limited data, and integration challenges. Our findings
challenge common assumptions in the field and suggest that simpler
architectures focusing on geometric consistency may be more effective for
few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting
joint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional
methods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg
radiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in
anteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical
landmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an
attention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical
features. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to
localize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape
while integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative
images. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA
measurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute
differences ~1{\deg} when compared to clinical ground truth measurements.
Agreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent
pre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good
post-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can
be automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced
clinical workflows.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Shape estimation for transparent objects is challenging due to their complex
light transport. To circumvent these difficulties, we leverage the Shape from
Polarization (SfP) technique in the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, where
most materials are opaque and emissive. While a few prior studies have explored
LWIR SfP, these attempts suffered from significant errors due to inadequate
polarimetric modeling, particularly the neglect of reflection. Addressing this
gap, we formulated a polarization model that explicitly accounts for the
combined effects of emission and reflection. Based on this model, we estimated
surface normals using not only a direct model-based method but also a
learning-based approach employing a neural network trained on a
physically-grounded synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we modeled the LWIR
polarimetric imaging process, accounting for inherent systematic errors to
ensure accurate polarimetry. We implemented a prototype system and created
ThermoPol, the first real-world benchmark dataset for LWIR SfP. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the high accuracy and broad
applicability of our method across various materials, including those
transparent in the visible spectrum.

Abstract: Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting
ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often
available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by
developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using
cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision
transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised
learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic
Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus
when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in
resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was
accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned
Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a
multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more
parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification
with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic
performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our
method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work
serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal
disorders in under-resourced areas.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant
paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images
into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism,
which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to
capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic
coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to
significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To
alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics,
spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and
propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive
Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies
historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those
essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently
streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic
KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption
during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving
beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we
identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn
shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly
strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and
(2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with
the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex
reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1
designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1
first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing
both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step
from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is
trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the
discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by
rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental
evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that
Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging
reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future
research and applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Natural language querying of visual content underpins many vision-language
tasks, typically categorized by text granularity and visual search scope.
Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves whole images using coarse descriptions,
while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes objects using
fine-grained expressions within a single image. However, real-world scenarios
often require both instance-level retrieval and localization across large
galleries -- tasks where TIR lacks precision and REC lacks scalability. To
address this gap, we propose a new task: Referring Expression Instance
Retrieval (REIR), which jointly supports instance-level retrieval and
localization. We introduce REIRCOCO, a large-scale benchmark constructed by
prompting vision-language models to generate fine-grained expressions for
MSCOCO and RefCOCO instances. We also present a baseline method, CLARE,
featuring a dual-stream architecture with a Mix of Relation Experts (MORE)
module for capturing inter-instance relationships. CLARE integrates object
detection and REC pretraining with Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment
(CLIA) for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that CLARE achieves
state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC,
highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging task as only
the video-level annotation is available during the training process. To address
this problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution
information in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo
labels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first
stage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the
second stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected
frames with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better
predict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal
information at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization
performance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level
pseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)
module, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high
quality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of
sequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to
one specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive
Temporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks
called Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate
CASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used
as two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo
labels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal
domain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve
each stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels
from another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction in the past was considered to require
precise geometric relationships in order to enable effective training. However,
in complex indoor environments, the large-scale and widespread collection of
data, along with the necessity for fine-grained annotations, becomes
impractical due to the complexity of data acquisition setups and privacy
concerns. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D spatially-accurate training can
be achieved using only indoor Internet data, without the need for any
pre-knowledge of intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters. In our framework, we
collect a web dataset, YouTube-Occ, which comprises house tour videos from
YouTube, providing abundant real house scenes for 3D representation learning.
Upon on this web dataset, we establish a fully self-supervised model to
leverage accessible 2D prior knowledge for reaching powerful 3D indoor
perception. Specifically, we harness the advantages of the prosperous vision
foundation models, distilling the 2D region-level knowledge into the occupancy
network by grouping the similar pixels into superpixels. Experimental results
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on two
popular benchmarks (NYUv2 and OccScanNet

Motivation: Traditional visual relocalization methods for visible light images are not applicable to thermal images due to their different data capture mechanism. Although deep learning has advanced camera relocalization, thermal-specific approaches are underexplored.

Method: ThermalLoc uses EfficientNet and Transformers to extract local and global features from thermal images, then employs two MLP networks for absolute pose regression.

Result: ThermalLoc was tested on public and own datasets, showing better accuracy and robustness than AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet, and RobustLoc.

Conclusion: ThermalLoc addresses the gap in thermal image relocalization by effectively combining EfficientNet and Transformers, offering a more accurate and robust solution compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Thermal cameras capture environmental data through heat emission, a
fundamentally different mechanism compared to visible light cameras, which rely
on pinhole imaging. As a result, traditional visual relocalization methods
designed for visible light images are not directly applicable to thermal
images. Despite significant advancements in deep learning for camera
relocalization, approaches specifically tailored for thermal camera-based
relocalization remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
ThermalLoc, a novel end-to-end deep learning method for thermal image
relocalization. ThermalLoc effectively extracts both local and global features
from thermal images by integrating EfficientNet with Transformers, and performs
absolute pose regression using two MLP networks. We evaluated ThermalLoc on
both the publicly available thermal-odometry dataset and our own dataset. The
results demonstrate that ThermalLoc outperforms existing representative methods
employed for thermal camera relocalization, including AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet,
and RobustLoc, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: As the deep learning revolution marches on, masked modeling has emerged as a
distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that
are proportionally masked during training, and has demonstrated exceptional
performance in multiple fields. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction
is a critical task in medical imaging that seeks to recover high-quality images
from under-sampled k-space data. However, previous MRI reconstruction
strategies usually optimized the entire image domain or k-space, without
considering the importance of different frequency regions in the k-space This
work introduces a diffusion model based on adaptive masks (AMDM), which
utilizes the adaptive adjustment of frequency distribution based on k-space
data to develop a hybrid masks mechanism that adapts to different k-space
inputs. This enables the effective separation of high-frequency and
low-frequency components, producing diverse frequency-specific representations.
Additionally, the k-space frequency distribution informs the generation of
adaptive masks, which, in turn, guide a closed-loop diffusion process.
Experimental results verified the ability of this method to learn specific
frequency information and thereby improved the quality of MRI reconstruction,
providing a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data using masks in the
future.

Abstract: Image explanation has been one of the key research interests in the Deep
Learning field. Throughout the years, several approaches have been adopted to
explain an input image fed by the user. From detecting an object in a given
image to explaining it in human understandable sentence, to having a
conversation describing the image, this problem has seen an immense change
throughout the years, However, the existing works have been often found to (a)
hallucinate objects that do not exist in the image and/or (b) lack identifying
the complete set of objects present in the image. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to mitigate these drawbacks of inconsistency and incompleteness
of the objects recognized during the image explanation. To enable this, we
propose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image
explaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering
(VQA) and Prompt-based AI using LLMs, thereby enhancing their explanation
capabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure
the efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed
approaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the
improvements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations.
Quantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over
the baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by
81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6%
and 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI
model (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively)
surpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics

conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in
open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise
andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of
Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly

and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning
architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid
ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions.
OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these
models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This
work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the
Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR
performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights
into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the
importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in
endoscopy.

Abstract: Quantitative descriptions of complete canopy architecture are crucial for
evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield to guide ideotype design. Although
three-dimensional (3D) sensing technologies have been developed for plant and
canopy reconstruction, severe occlusion and complex architectures hinder
accurate canopy descriptions. In this study, we propose a point cloud
completion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to
silique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation
framework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation
method and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset
by distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point
cloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic
graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict
occluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph
convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural
variations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud
completion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators
from complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated
that RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm,
and 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages,
respectively. Ablation studies showed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE
modules, reducing CD values by 10% and 23%, respectively. The silique
efficiency index (SEI) from RP-PCN improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2%
compared to incomplete point clouds. The RP-PCN pipeline proposed in this study
has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly enhancing the
analysis of population canopy architectures in field environments.

cover identification for irrigated regions of Central Punjab. Data collection
was executed in two stages: the first involved identifying and geocoding six
target crops through field surveys conducted in January and February 2023. The
second stage involved acquiring Landsat 8-9 imagery for each geocoded field to
construct a labelled dataset. The satellite imagery underwent extensive
pre-processing, including radiometric calibration for reflectance values,
atmospheric correction, and georeferencing verification to ensure consistency
within a common coordinate system. Subsequently, image fusion techniques were
applied to combine Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands, creating a composite image
with enhanced spectral information, followed by contrast enhancement. During
data acquisition, farmers were interviewed, and fields were meticulously mapped
using GPS instruments, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 50,835 data
points. This dataset facilitated the extraction of vegetation indices such as
NDVI, SAVO, RECI, and NDRE. These indices and raw reflectance values were
utilized for classification modeling using conventional classifiers, ensemble
learning, and artificial neural networks. A feature selection approach was also
incorporated to identify the optimal feature set for classification learning.
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining remote sensing data and
advanced modeling techniques to improve crop classification accuracy in

Abstract: Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential

contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious
correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on
extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a
benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering
(VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and
synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious
correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of
124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets,
each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364
multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on
SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle
significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic
examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to
78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to
unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to
the overall image context.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable

this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a
novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture
or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants:
PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in
input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and
PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize
harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics,
effectively balancing safety and usability.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generative models have achieved impressive results but
3D contents generated by these models may not align with subjective human
preferences or task-specific criteria. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D
texture generation domain remains: most existing approaches rely on repeated
calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent
understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To address this,
we propose an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework that
back-propagates human preferences, represented by differentiable reward
functions, through the entire 3D generative pipeline, making the process
inherently geometry-aware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
using four proposed novel geometry-aware reward functions, offering a more
controllable and interpretable pathway for high-quality 3D content creation
from natural language.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Segmenting biomarkers in medical images is crucial for various biotech
applications. Despite advances, Transformer and CNN based methods often
struggle with variations in staining and morphology, limiting feature
extraction. In medical image segmentation, where datasets often have limited
sample availability, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieve higher
accuracy by leveraging pre-trained encoders, whereas end-to-end methods tend to
underperform. This is due to challenges in effectively transferring rich
multiscale features from encoders to decoders, as well as limitations in
decoder efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that
captures multi-scale local and global contextual information and a novel
decoder design, which effectively integrates features from the encoder,
emphasizes important channels and regions, and reconstructs spatial dimensions
to enhance segmentation accuracy. Our method, compatible with various encoders,
outperforms SOTA methods, as demonstrated by experiments on four datasets and
ablation studies. Specifically, our method achieves absolute performance gains
of 2.76% on MoNuSeg, 3.12% on DSB, 2.87% on Electron Microscopy, and 4.03% on
TNBC datasets compared to existing SOTA methods. Code:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant
limitations in simultaneously improving brightness while preserving semantic
consistency, fine details, and computational efficiency. With the emergence of
state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved
remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images
into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting
interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining
their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these
fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture
comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic
Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by
prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels,
effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks
through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic
Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic
meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting
semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical
nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens
based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning
patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing
while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while
preserving semantic consistency.

TL;DR: This paper proposes SFIFNet, which integrates frequency domain information with spatial domain information to improve few-shot classification performance by enhancing image feature representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of overfitting and poor generalization in few-shot learning due to limited data, while current models focus on spatial domain and neglect frequency domain features that contain more information.

Method: Enhancing image feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial domain information based on conventional data augmentation.

Result: The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves classification performance.

Conclusion: Integrating frequency domain information with spatial domain information can enhance the model's ability to exploit feature information, thereby improving classification performance in few-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: The objective of Few-shot learning is to fully leverage the limited data
resources for exploring the latent correlations within the data by applying
algorithms and training a model with outstanding performance that can
adequately meet the demands of practical applications. In practical
applications, the number of images in each category is usually less than that
in traditional deep learning, which can lead to over-fitting and poor
generalization performance. Currently, many Few-shot classification models pay
more attention to spatial domain information while neglecting frequency domain
information, which contains more feature information. Ignoring frequency domain
information will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information,
which would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data
augmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data
preprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image
feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial
domain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this method in enhancing classification performance.

Abstract: Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in
safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety,
or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected
with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting
anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton
sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level.
The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint
locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of
the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across
its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint
locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our
anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the
weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite
its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the
UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the
ShanghaiTech dataset.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate
personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In
this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing
post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being
post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT),
these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world
scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring
large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and
difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for
personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual
recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently
outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging
multi-concept image captioning task.

Result: The dataset provides baseline results and standardized evaluation protocols for both tasks, offering a foundation for developing multimodal models that can reason about complex real-world events.

Conclusion: OpenEvents V1 is a valuable resource for advancing multimodal models in understanding and reasoning about real-world events through contextual and temporal grounding.

Abstract: We introduce OpenEvents V1, a large-scale benchmark dataset aimed at

19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we
propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view
reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not
been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on
InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on
VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks.
We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to enable interpretable risk modelling for melanoma diagnosis, going beyond binary classification to provide nuanced assessments and clinical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Melanoma is a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression and high mortality, requiring early and interpretable diagnostic tools. Current deep learning models for skin lesion classification are limited to binary outputs, which don't offer sufficient clinical insight.

Method: The paper introduces a novel approach using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a structured latent space that captures semantic relationships among skin lesions. An SVM is trained on this representation to differentiate between benign nevi and melanomas.

Result: The method effectively differentiates between benign nevi and melanomas with strong and consistent performance. The learned latent space allows for visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, where spatial proximity to known melanomas indicates risk.

Conclusion: The approach combines predictive performance with clinical applicability, aiding early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and increasing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparency and interpretability.

Abstract: Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression
and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic
tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most
existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight.
This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification,
enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures
semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous
assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this
representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,
demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned
latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with
the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful
indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical
applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and
enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable
decision-making.

designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural
Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19
patients, leveraging diverse publicly available Chest X-ray datasets. Our
experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning
strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and
Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods
including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were
conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive
full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings,
which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging
health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a
diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures
pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to
biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we
rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to
prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and
pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical
conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and
class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and
limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured
evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust,
efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Image inpainting plays a vital role in restoring missing image regions and
supporting high-level vision tasks, but traditional methods struggle with
complex textures and large occlusions. Although Transformer-based approaches
have demonstrated strong global modeling capabilities, they often fail to
preserve high-frequency details due to the low-pass nature of self-attention
and suffer from high computational costs. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a Transformer-based image inpainting method incorporating
frequency-domain fusion. Specifically, an attention mechanism combining wavelet
transform and Gabor filtering is introduced to enhance multi-scale structural
modeling and detail preservation. Additionally, a learnable frequency-domain
filter based on the fast Fourier transform is designed to replace the
feedforward network, enabling adaptive noise suppression and detail retention.
The model adopts a four-level encoder-decoder structure and is guided by a
novel loss strategy to balance global semantics and fine details. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the quality
of image inpainting by preserving more high-frequency information.

Abstract: Editing natural images using textual descriptions in text-to-image diffusion
models remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving consistent
generation and handling complex, non-rigid objects. Existing methods often
struggle to preserve textures and identity, require extensive fine-tuning, and
exhibit limitations in editing specific spatial regions or objects while
retaining background details. This paper proposes Context-Preserving Adaptive
Manipulation (CPAM), a novel zero-shot framework for complicated, non-rigid
real image editing. Specifically, we propose a preservation adaptation module
that adjusts self-attention mechanisms to preserve and independently control
the object and background effectively. This ensures that the objects' shapes,
textures, and identities are maintained while keeping the background
undistorted during the editing process using the mask guidance technique.
Additionally, we develop a localized extraction module to mitigate the
interference with the non-desired modified regions during conditioning in
cross-attention mechanisms. We also introduce various mask-guidance strategies
to facilitate diverse image manipulation tasks in a simple manner. Extensive
experiments on our newly constructed Image Manipulation BenchmArk (IMBA), a
robust benchmark dataset specifically designed for real image editing,
demonstrate that our proposed method is the preferred choice among human
raters, outperforming existing state-of-the-art editing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve dense image representations in vision encoders for better in-context scene understanding without needing labeled data or complex architectures.

Method: DIP uses pseudo-tasks generated by a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself to train the encoder in an unsupervised manner, inspired by meta-learning.

Result: DIP achieves strong performance on various real-world in-context scene understanding tasks, outperforming the initial encoder and prior methods with lower computational requirements.

Conclusion: DIP offers a practical and effective unsupervised post-training solution for enhancing dense representations in vision encoders, suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to
enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders
for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on
complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder
using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios,
inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled
data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that
combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is
simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9
hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo
in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of
downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both
the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and
effective solution for improving dense representations. Code available here:

Abstract: An ideal vision-language agent serves as a bridge between the human users and
their surrounding physical world in real-world applications like autonomous
driving and embodied agents, and proactively provides accurate and timely
responses given user intents. An intriguing challenge arises when agents
interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users:
supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears
asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground
their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future
streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user
queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the
streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities
but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with
temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that
evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle
interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous
Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc
queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of
three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and
evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose
memory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that
existing models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA
significantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness. Our code and

Motivation: Existing methods for SSVPG focus on teacher-student consistency and video-level contrastive loss but ignore the potential of perturbing query contexts to create stronger supervisory signals.

Method: Introduces CCL framework combining consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. Student model uses strongly-augmented samples with sentences removed, learning from teacher's strong signals. Retrains model with pseudo labels, using mutual agreement between original and augmented predictions as confidence.

Result: CCL significantly outperforms existing methods in SSVPG tasks.

Conclusion: CCL is effective for semi-supervised video paragraph grounding by leveraging context perturbation and consistency learning, offering a new approach that improves upon current techniques.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (SSVPG) aims to localize multiple
sentences in a paragraph from an untrimmed video with limited temporal
annotations. Existing methods focus on teacher-student consistency learning and
video-level contrastive loss, but they overlook the importance of perturbing
query contexts to generate strong supervisory signals. In this work, we propose
a novel Context Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that unifies the paradigms
of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to enhance semi-supervised
learning. Specifically, we first conduct teacher-student learning where the
student model takes as inputs strongly-augmented samples with sentences removed
and is enforced to learn from the adequately strong supervisory signals from
the teacher model. Afterward, we conduct model retraining based on the
generated pseudo labels, where the mutual agreement between the original and
augmented views' predictions is utilized as the label confidence. Extensive
experiments show that CCL outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to
recreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective
alternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&E-HER2
staining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of
sufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it
is currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular
task. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly
available dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both
H&E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel
Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate
that, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving
comparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment,
as all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to
the widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new
high-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both
model training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers
valuable guidance for researchers working on the topic.

Abstract: Customizing image generation remains a core challenge in controllable image
synthesis. For single-concept generation, maintaining both identity
preservation and prompt alignment is challenging. In multi-concept scenarios,
relying solely on a prompt without additional conditions like layout boxes or
semantic masks, often leads to identity loss and concept omission. In this
paper, we introduce ShowFlow, a comprehensive framework designed to tackle
these challenges. We propose ShowFlow-S for single-concept image generation,
and ShowFlow-M for handling multiple concepts. ShowFlow-S introduces a
KronA-WED adapter, which integrates a Kronecker adapter with weight and
embedding decomposition, and employs a disentangled learning approach with a
novel attention regularization objective to enhance single-concept generation.
Building on this foundation, ShowFlow-M directly reuses the learned models from
ShowFlow-S to support multi-concept generation without extra conditions,
incorporating a Subject-Adaptive Matching Attention (SAMA) and a layout
consistency strategy as the plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments and
user studies validate ShowFlow's effectiveness, highlighting its potential in
real-world applications like advertising and virtual dressing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely adopted model compression technique
where a compact student model learns from the output of a larger, pre-trained
teacher. While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers
significantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher
model tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision
for tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation
(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by
reformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and
intra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction
distributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),
respectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources
of teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group
loss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform
intra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during
distillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and
ImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,
achieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class
performance. Our results demonstrate that LTKD enables effective knowledge
transfer even from biased teachers, making it a strong candidate for real-world
deployment in resource-constrained and imbalanced settings.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative
model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks,
including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike
OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image
modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This
design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models
without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text
generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed
comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and
in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism
tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset
based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2
achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including
text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,
also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named
OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code,
datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this
field. Project Page: https://vectorspacelab.github.io/OmniGen2; GitHub Link:

Abstract: Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative
technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities,
resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale
pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However,
their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or
specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research
focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to
various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize
the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM
literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are
categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods
according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in
each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical
transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the
era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced
with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the
advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses
the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large
language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the
surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical
generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of
current and future multimodal researches.

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual
understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation.
At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into
discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language
model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space
with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input
and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific
designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to
balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to
produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we
utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a
diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced
pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and
generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses
existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater
training efficiency. Code, models, and data are available at

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable multi-disease diagnosis remains a critical
challenge in medical research, particularly when leveraging heterogeneous
multimodal medical data. Current approaches often rely on single-modal data,
limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To
address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning
and diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction
dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level
interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach.
MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal
dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we
employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature
utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for
clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity
reasoning. The dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Translation equivariance is a fundamental inductive bias in image
restoration, ensuring that translated inputs produce translated outputs.
Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this
property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To
alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating
translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing
maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention
being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of
translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building
complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these
strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high
computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated
with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding
indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which
are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The
designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer
(TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The
results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training
convergence, and generalization.

Result: The learned representations successfully capture both disease state and cell type variations, enabling a unified framework for analyzing images from high-resolution cell nuclei to low-resolution tissue images.

Conclusion: Embedding pathology images in a hyperbolic space via self-supervised learning provides an effective way to model hierarchical relationships and morphological changes, which can enhance the analysis and interpretation of malignant lymphoma images.

Abstract: We propose a method for representing malignant lymphoma pathology images,
from high-resolution cell nuclei to low-resolution tissue images, within a

morphological changes that occur across scales during disease progression, our

based on inclusion relationships. Using the Poincar\'e ball as the feature
space enables effective encoding of this hierarchical structure. The learned

Abstract: Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D
content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across
multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse
conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)
method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate
consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the
next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its
effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating
widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract
effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that
accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training
strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection
modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal
conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This
strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to
enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through
the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the
overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the
"Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the
training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance
and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent
multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading
diffusion-based multi-view image generation models. Code and models will be

Abstract: We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing
dissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances
in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data
points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data
points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry
crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic
\underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure
(HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global
structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic
sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets.
To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite
Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust
approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by
considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced
understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical
evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot
image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms
existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex
relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Learning in hyperbolic spaces has attracted increasing attention due to its
superior ability to model hierarchical structures of data. Most existing
hyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming
a uniform hierarchy across all data points. However, real-world hierarchical
structures exhibit significant diversity, making this assumption overly
restrictive. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in
hyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures.
Our approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections
and curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an
appropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition
scheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of
pair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an
upper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration
inequality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive experiments on standard
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), hierarchical
classification (5-level CIFAR-100), and few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet,
tiered-ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach
consistently outperforms learning methods that use fixed distance measures,
with notable improvements on few-shot learning tasks, where it achieves over
5\% gains on mini-ImageNet. The results reveal that adaptive distance measures
better capture diverse hierarchical structures, with visualization showing
clearer class boundaries and improved prototype separation in hyperbolic
spaces.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, detecting logical anomalies is becoming a more challenging task
compared to detecting structural ones. Existing encoder decoder based methods
typically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption
that the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of
logical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a
particular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal
semantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.
Thanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these
abnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.
This ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with
misleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel
normality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly
detection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder
directly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the
reconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics
of normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable
semantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of
normal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic
features are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the
reconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves
the SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in
pixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC. The source code is available at

Abstract: Audio-visual sound source localization task aims to spatially localize
sound-making objects within visual scenes by integrating visual and audio cues.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately localizing sound-making
objects in complex scenes, particularly when visually similar silent objects
coexist. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on simple
audio-visual correspondence, which does not capture fine-grained semantic
differences between sound-making and silent objects. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel sound source localization framework leveraging
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate detailed contextual
information that explicitly distinguishes between sound-making foreground
objects and silent background objects. To effectively integrate this detailed
information, we introduce two novel loss functions: Object-aware Contrastive
Alignment (OCA) loss and Object Region Isolation (ORI) loss. Extensive
experimental results on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming existing methods in
both single-source and multi-source localization scenarios. Code and generated

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have led to the emergence of
powerful text-to-video generation models. Despite these successes, evaluating
the quality of AIGC-generated videos remains challenging due to limited
generalization, lack of temporal awareness, heavy reliance on large-scale
annotated datasets, and the lack of effective interaction with generation
models. Most current approaches rely on supervised finetuning of
vision-language models (VLMs), which often require large-scale annotated
datasets and tend to decouple understanding and generation. To address these
shortcomings, we propose VQ-Insight, a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for
AIGC video quality assessment. Our approach features: (1) a progressive video
quality learning scheme that combines image quality warm-up, general
task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with the video
generation model; (2) the design of multi-dimension scoring rewards, preference
comparison rewards, and temporal modeling rewards to enhance both
generalization and specialization in video quality evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VQ-Insight consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring,
and natural video scoring, bringing significant improvements for video
generation tasks.

Abstract: Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding,
executing, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without
visual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they
often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the
cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual
visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a
specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's
execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the
initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge
extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual
descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained
visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast,
VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key
insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable
targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while
maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated
pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We
evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video
datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of 3D Gaussian primitives in differentiable rendering, such as slow rendering speed and difficulty with advanced effects like relighting and shadows, by proposing a more efficient and effective representation.

Method: The method involves replacing 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets, using a compactness parameter to directly train photorealistic meshes, combining discrete mesh-like structures with continuous volumetric modeling benefits.

Result: The vanilla version of 2DTS achieves higher fidelity than state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods and produces reconstructed meshes with better visual quality than existing mesh reconstruction techniques.

Conclusion: 2D Triangle Splatting offers a promising alternative for 3D scene reconstruction, balancing the advantages of Gaussian and mesh-based approaches while overcoming their respective drawbacks.

Abstract: Differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives has emerged as a
powerful method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from multi-view
images. While it offers improvements over NeRF-based methods, this
representation still encounters challenges with rendering speed and advanced
rendering effects, such as relighting and shadow rendering, compared to
mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a
novel method that replaces 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets.
This representation naturally forms a discrete mesh-like structure while
retaining the benefits of continuous volumetric modeling. By incorporating a
compactness parameter into the triangle primitives, we enable direct training
of photorealistic meshes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
triangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning),
achieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods.
Furthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual
quality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods.

Result: The approach outperforms common alternatives like jittering, resizing, and masking on agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2 imagery. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the S2-Agri100 dataset without relying on spatial information or temporal encodings.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their resampling-based augmentation method is simple yet effective for contrastive learning in remote sensing time series, offering a promising approach for leveraging unlabeled data.

Abstract: Given the abundance of unlabeled Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) and the
scarcity of labeled data, contrastive self-supervised pretraining emerges as a
natural tool to leverage this vast quantity of unlabeled data. However,
designing effective data augmentations for contrastive learning remains
challenging for time series. We introduce a novel resampling-based augmentation
strategy that generates positive pairs by upsampling time series and extracting
disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage. We validate our
approach on multiple agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2
imagery, showing that it outperforms common alternatives such as jittering,
resizing, and masking. Further, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the

Abstract: State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and
image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial
perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused,
implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to
the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally
infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the
worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose
computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial
patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble
of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the
neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It
then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the
input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors,
SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial
regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We
evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and
classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art
defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection
and the case of image classification, respectively. Our code is available at

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of faithfully reproducing real-world physics in video generation without relying on costly human-annotated datasets or reward models.

Method: The method involves reverse-sampling real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to create statistically distinguishable preference pairs, followed by multi-stage iterative training to align the generator with physical laws.

Result: RDPO significantly enhances action coherence and physical realism in generated videos, with improvements validated through benchmarks and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that RDPO provides an effective annotation-free approach to improve physical consistency in video generation, leveraging real-world video data for better adherence to physical laws.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual
quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive.
Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but
requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet
feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference
Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors
directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO
reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to
automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in
terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then
guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from
the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO
significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the
generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have
demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions. The

Abstract: Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces
two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2)
inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework
for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists'
diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to
provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from
pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A
bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token
and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and
retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment
between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder
integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation.
Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's
superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative
improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for
Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the
necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide

Result: Experiments demonstrated that extracting less biased features improves classification performance, particularly in similarity-based MIL classifiers.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and FM-SI metric provide a valuable tool for evaluating histopathology FMs, emphasizing the importance of reducing feature bias for better performance in MIL tasks.

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology
foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations,
enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology,
automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL)
frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among
histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for
evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel
benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors
within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the
AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging
cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model -
Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against
distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased
features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based
MIL classifiers.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is challenging due to overlapping anatomies with
ambiguous boundaries and a severe imbalance between the foreground and
background classes, which particularly affects the delineation of small
lesions. Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven
variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or
user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize
well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we
propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by
clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into
structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via
transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM
backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic
convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable
sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance
early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class
cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging
benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and
ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based
systems.

Motivation: Accurate 3D reconstruction of tornadoes is essential for understanding and mitigating their destruction, but there's no controlled dataset available for development and validation.

Method: The authors created a multiview dataset of a small laboratory tornado and applied 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for 3D structure reconstruction and visualization.

Result: The paper successfully reconstructed and visualized the 3D structure of a lab-based tornado using 3DGS.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel dataset and demonstrates the feasibility of using 3DGS for tornado 3D reconstruction, which could aid in future research and disaster preparedness.

Abstract: Accurately reconstructing the 3D structure of tornadoes is critically
important for understanding and preparing for this highly destructive weather
phenomenon. While modern 3D scene reconstruction techniques, such as 3D
Gaussian splatting (3DGS), could provide a valuable tool for reconstructing the
3D structure of tornados, at present we are critically lacking a controlled
tornado dataset with which to develop and validate these tools. In this work we
capture and release a novel multiview dataset of a small lab-based tornado. We
demonstrate one can effectively reconstruct and visualize the 3D structure of
this tornado using 3DGS.

Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results
in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are
constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale
scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks
cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose
the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with
hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop
closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel
triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene
reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to
achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also
design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different
submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that
provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D
meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam
(DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging
from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth
for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can
advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and
visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and
communication. The dataset and code will open-source on

Abstract: We introduce MARL-MambaContour, the first contour-based medical image
segmentation framework based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Our
approach reframes segmentation as a multi-agent cooperation task focused on
generate topologically consistent object-level contours, addressing the
limitations of traditional pixel-based methods which could lack topological
constraints and holistic structural awareness of anatomical regions. Each
contour point is modeled as an autonomous agent that iteratively adjusts its
position to align precisely with the target boundary, enabling adaptation to
blurred edges and intricate morphologies common in medical images. This
iterative adjustment process is optimized by a contour-specific Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, further enhanced with the Entropy Regularization
Adjustment Mechanism (ERAM) which dynamically balance agent exploration with
contour smoothness. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a Mamba-based
policy network featuring a novel Bidirectional Cross-attention Hidden-state
Fusion Mechanism (BCHFM). This mechanism mitigates potential memory confusion
limitations associated with long-range modeling in state space models, thereby
facilitating more accurate inter-agent information exchange and informed
decision-making. Extensive experiments on five diverse medical imaging datasets
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MARL-MambaContour, highlighting
its potential as an accurate and robust clinical application.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving (AD) have highlighted the potential of
Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly
in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing
its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances
spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying
kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation
mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our
proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation
performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and
Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with
minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82%
GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average
improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets.
Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel
combinations perform better than single-scale configurations. These findings
demonstrate the potential of HSI processing for AD and provide valuable
insights into designing robust, multi-scale spectral feature extractors for
real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce the Shape-Image Multimodal Network (SIM-Net), a novel 2D image
classification architecture that integrates 3D point cloud representations
inferred directly from RGB images. Our key contribution lies in a
pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point
clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for
enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for
the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by
heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise
conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a
segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point
cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image
features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused
into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets
demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of
up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several
transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of
incorporating 3D structural reasoning into 2D image classification tasks.

Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips
and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard

generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user
actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control
over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual
quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld
Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action
controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world
generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently
outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and
MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in
controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations
further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's
biometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of
revocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme
is revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme
revoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the
individual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition
power. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust
revocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and
training set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face
matcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)
strongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power
extends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have
the same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the
models can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The
biometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible
that the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is
typically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different
persons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value
in attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor
template. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT)
backbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this
work and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based
deep CNN backbones.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and
cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data
sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic
Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy
and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods
lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting
in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded
areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel
mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA
significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results
on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by
integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields
consistent gains across modalities.

  Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from

authenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system
provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established

  Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human
preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation
features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over
meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured

Abstract: The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation
to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant
challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory
resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in
task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy
inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention
mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch
Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch
embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve
efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module
in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism
allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch
embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively
modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while
maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves
training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is
lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer
architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture
provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while
achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

Abstract: Dynamic Novel View Synthesis aims to generate photorealistic views of moving

spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a
diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that
aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on
DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that
ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and

object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for
foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all

Abstract: Real-time, on-device segmentation is critical for latency-sensitive and

model optimized for edge and in-sensor execution, including the Sony IMX500. It
builds on a depthwise separable U-Net, with knowledge distillation and
fixed-point prompt encoding to learn from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2).
On COCO and LVIS, it achieves 51.9% and 44.9% mIoU, respectively. The quantized
model (1.22MB) runs at 14.3 ms on the IMX500-achieving 86 MACs/cycle, making it
the only model meeting both memory and compute constraints for in-sensor
deployment. Distillation boosts LVIS performance by +3.5% mIoU and +5.1% mAP.
These results demonstrate that efficient, promptable segmentation is feasible
directly on-camera, enabling privacy-preserving vision without cloud or host

Motivation: Current 4D video diffusion architectures have limitations in spatial and temporal attention mechanisms, either processing them sequentially or in parallel within a two-stream design. The paper aims to address these limitations by proposing a more effective approach.

Method: The framework consists of two main components: a 4D video model with a fused architecture that combines spatial and temporal attention in a single layer using a sparse attention pattern, and a 4D reconstruction model that extends existing 3D reconstruction algorithms with a Gaussian head, camera token replacement, and dynamic layers.

Result: The proposed framework achieves a new state of the art in 4D generation, demonstrating improvements in both visual quality and reconstruction capability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper presents an innovative approach to 4D video generation that effectively integrates spatial and temporal attention, leading to enhanced performance in generating and reconstructing 4D spatio-temporal grids of video frames and 3D Gaussian particles.

Abstract: We propose the first framework capable of computing a 4D spatio-temporal grid

video diffusion architectures that perform spatial and temporal attention
either sequentially or in parallel within a two-stream design. We highlight the
limitations of existing approaches and introduce a novel fused architecture
that performs spatial and temporal attention within a single layer. The key to
our method is a sparse attention pattern, where tokens attend to others in the
same frame, at the same timestamp, or from the same viewpoint. In the second
part, we extend existing 3D reconstruction algorithms by introducing a Gaussian
head, a camera token replacement algorithm, and additional dynamic layers and
training. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for 4D generation,

Abstract: Subject-to-video generation has witnessed substantial progress in recent
years. However, existing models still face significant challenges in faithfully
following textual instructions. This limitation, commonly known as the
copy-paste problem, arises from the widely used in-pair training paradigm. This
approach inherently entangles subject identity with background and contextual
attributes by sampling reference images from the same scene as the target
video. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Phantom-Data, the first
general-purpose cross-pair subject-to-video consistency dataset}, containing
approximately one million identity-consistent pairs across diverse categories.
Our dataset is constructed via a three-stage pipeline: (1) a general and
input-aligned subject detection module, (2) large-scale cross-context subject
retrieval from more than 53 million videos and 3 billion images, and (3)
prior-guided identity verification to ensure visual consistency under
contextual variation. Comprehensive experiments show that training with
Phantom-Data significantly improves prompt alignment and visual quality while

### [164] [RAG-6DPose: Retrieval-Augmented 6D Pose Estimation via Leveraging CAD as Knowledge Base](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18856)
*Kuanning Wang,Yuqian Fu,Tianyu Wang,Yanwei Fu,Longfei Liang,Yu-Gang Jiang,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAG-6DPose is a retrieval-augmented method for 6D pose estimation using 3D CAD models as a knowledge base, combining visual and geometric cues through three stages: building a multi-modal CAD knowledge base, retrieving CAD features with ReSPC, and refining pose predictions with retrieval-augmented decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 6D pose estimation is crucial for robotic manipulation tasks such as grasping, but existing methods struggle with occlusions and novel viewpoints.

Method: RAG-6DPose uses 3D CAD models as a knowledge base, integrating visual and geometric cues. It involves three stages: building a multi-modal CAD knowledge base with 2D visual features and 3D points, retrieving CAD features via ReSPC module, and refining pose predictions using retrieval-augmented decoding.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks show RAG-6DPose is effective and robust, especially in handling occlusions and novel viewpoints.

Conclusion: RAG-6DPose enhances 6D pose estimation by leveraging 3D CAD models and retrieval mechanisms, offering improved performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is key for robotic manipulation, enabling precise
object localization for tasks like grasping. We present RAG-6DPose, a
retrieval-augmented approach that leverages 3D CAD models as a knowledge base
by integrating both visual and geometric cues. Our RAG-6DPose roughly contains
three stages: 1) Building a Multi-Modal CAD Knowledge Base by extracting 2D
visual features from multi-view CAD rendered images and also attaching 3D
points; 2) Retrieving relevant CAD features from the knowledge base based on
the current query image via our ReSPC module; and 3) Incorporating retrieved
CAD information to refine pose predictions via retrieval-augmented decoding.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, particularly in
handling occlusions and novel viewpoints. Supplementary material is available

Abstract: Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal
reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel
task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene
generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal
dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for
satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen
MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and
contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a
Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines
high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced
ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and
semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs
outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and
future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal
reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for
spatio-temporal understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniAvatar is an audio-driven full-body video generation model that improves lip-sync accuracy and natural movements through pixel-wise multi-hierarchical audio embeddings and LoRA-based training, outperforming existing models in various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing audio-driven human animation methods that focus mainly on facial movements, leading to less natural full-body animations and difficulty in precise prompt control for fine-grained generation.

Method: OmniAvatar uses a pixel-wise multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to capture audio features in the latent space, and a LoRA-based training approach to maintain prompt-driven control of foundation models while incorporating audio features.

Result: Extensive experiments show that OmniAvatar surpasses existing models in both facial and semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating videos in various domains like podcasts, human interactions, dynamic scenes, and singing.

Conclusion: OmniAvatar enhances audio-driven full-body animation by improving lip-sync accuracy and natural movements, demonstrating superior performance in diverse video generation tasks while allowing for precise prompt control.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in audio-driven human animation, while
most existing methods focus mainly on facial movements, limiting their ability
to create full-body animations with natural synchronization and fluidity. They
also struggle with precise prompt control for fine-grained generation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce OmniAvatar, an innovative audio-driven
full-body video generation model that enhances human animation with improved
lip-sync accuracy and natural movements. OmniAvatar introduces a pixel-wise
multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to better capture audio features in
the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes. To preserve the
capability for prompt-driven control of foundation models while effectively
incorporating audio features, we employ a LoRA-based training approach.
Extensive experiments show that OmniAvatar surpasses existing models in both
facial and semi-body video generation, offering precise text-based control for

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Aligning the rhythm of visual motion in a video with a given music track is a
practical need in multimedia production, yet remains an underexplored task in
autonomous video editing. Effective alignment between motion and musical beats
enhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,
promotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend
on labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based
editing techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models
handle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two
modalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while
preserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and
efficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that
automatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while
preserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize
the task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with
audio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first
insert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a
frame-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,
preserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time
training can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the
inpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed
by rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid
approach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA
4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone. Extensive experiments show
that our approach can achieve high-quality beat alignment and visual
smoothness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing methods like SDM-UniPS and UniMS-PS in handling arbitrary lighting and complex surfaces.

Method: Proposes a novel approach to decouple illumination effects from surface normals and enhance high-frequency detail preservation.

Result: Achieves better surface normal recovery under varying lighting conditions and captures intricate geometric details more accurately.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances universal photometric stereo by addressing key challenges in illumination handling and detail preservation.

Abstract: Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover high-quality surface
normals from objects under arbitrary lighting conditions without relying on
specific illumination models. Despite recent advances such as SDM-UniPS and Uni
MS-PS, two fundamental challenges persist: 1) the deep coupling between varying
illumination and surface normal features, where ambiguity in observed intensity
makes it difficult to determine whether brightness variations stem from
lighting changes or surface orientation; and 2) the preservation of
high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces, where intricate
geometries create self-shadowing, inter-reflections, and subtle normal
variations that conventional feature processing operations struggle to capture
accurately.

Abstract: This paper presents a computational model for universal video temporal
grounding, which accurately localizes temporal moments in videos based on
natural language queries (e.g., questions or descriptions). Unlike existing
methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we
propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the
strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse
views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The
key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal
grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate
temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii)
By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities
through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding
for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that
UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and
dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding
benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form
video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA
accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Can we scale 4D pretraining to learn general space-time representations that
reconstruct an object from a few views at some times to any view at any time?
We provide an affirmative answer with 4D-LRM, the first large-scale 4D
reconstruction model that takes input from unconstrained views and timestamps
and renders arbitrary novel view-time combinations. Unlike prior 4D approaches,
e.g., optimization-based, geometry-based, or generative, that struggle with
efficiency, generalization, or faithfulness, 4D-LRM learns a unified space-time
representation and directly predicts per-pixel 4D Gaussian primitives from
posed image tokens across time, enabling fast, high-quality rendering at, in
principle, infinite frame rate. Our results demonstrate that scaling
spatiotemporal pretraining enables accurate and efficient 4D reconstruction. We
show that 4D-LRM generalizes to novel objects, interpolates across time, and
handles diverse camera setups. It reconstructs 24-frame sequences in one
forward pass with less than 1.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

Abstract: AI-driven content creation has shown potential in film production. However,
existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and
thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse
camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and
unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end
AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for
professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard
outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography
from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,
audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,
FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which
transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage
which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual
and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a
Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in
generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a
vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates
professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm
Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by
simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements
to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models
like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive
experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and
cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a collaborative multi-agent framework to improve visual consistency in story visualization by iteratively identifying and correcting inconsistencies without re-generating entire sequences, compatible with various diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of maintaining visual consistency in story visualization, especially preserving key character attributes across multiple panels, which current diffusion models fail to do consistently.

Method: The method involves a collaborative multi-agent framework that works iteratively to detect, correct, and refine inconsistencies in multi-panel story visuals, allowing for detailed panel-level adjustments without needing to regenerate the whole sequence.

Result: The results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances multi-panel consistency compared to previous approaches, as supported by both quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that the framework effectively improves visual consistency in story generation, is model-agnostic, and can be integrated with different diffusion models like Flux and Stable Diffusion.

Abstract: Story visualization has become a popular task where visual scenes are
generated to depict a narrative across multiple panels. A central challenge in
this setting is maintaining visual consistency, particularly in how characters
and objects persist and evolve throughout the story. Despite recent advances in
diffusion models, current approaches often fail to preserve key character
attributes, leading to incoherent narratives. In this work, we propose a
collaborative multi-agent framework that autonomously identifies, corrects, and
refines inconsistencies across multi-panel story visualizations. The agents
operate in an iterative loop, enabling fine-grained, panel-level updates
without re-generating entire sequences. Our framework is model-agnostic and
flexibly integrates with a variety of diffusion models, including rectified
flow transformers such as Flux and latent diffusion models such as Stable
Diffusion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method
outperforms prior approaches in terms of multi-panel consistency.

Abstract: We introduce RealPlay, a neural network-based real-world game engine that
enables interactive video generation from user control signals. Unlike prior
works focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic,
temporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It
operates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a
control command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such
realistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including
iterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency
across iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a
combination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without
requiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of
generalization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals
from virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training
labels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control
diverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond
vehicles. Project page can be found: https://wenqsun.github.io/RealPlay/

TL;DR: The paper introduces VMem, a memory mechanism for video generators that uses 3D surfels to efficiently retrieve past views, improving scene coherence and camera control with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for video generation either accumulate errors through out-painting 2D views while reconstructing 3D geometry or struggle with long-term scene coherence due to short context windows.

Method: Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem) remembers past views by indexing them based on 3D surface elements (surfels), allowing efficient retrieval of relevant views for generating new ones.

Result: VMem achieves superior performance in maintaining scene coherence and camera control on long-term scene synthesis benchmarks compared to existing methods, with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: VMem provides an efficient and effective way to build video generators that can interactively explore environments by leveraging geometrically indexed past views.

Abstract: We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can
explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been
achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally
reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video
generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene
coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce
Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by
indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they
have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past
views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our
method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction
of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our
approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate
superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene
coherence and camera control.

Abstract: Editing illumination in long videos with complex dynamics has significant

manipulation, as well as data scaling up for embodied AI through sim2real and
real2real transfer. Nevertheless, existing video relighting techniques are
predominantly limited to portrait videos or fall into the bottleneck of
temporal consistency and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TC-Light, a novel paradigm characterized by the proposed two-stage post
optimization mechanism. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an
inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first
stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical
video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained
texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate
performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark.
Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible
relighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

Abstract: We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under
two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised

flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource
settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative
study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and
model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.
  Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each
approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our
findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and
generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers
practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes
empirical insight into the ongoing debate over prompting versus fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand
and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their
specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect
(ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due
to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal
inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is
fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural
learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries
are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can
encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized
population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we
propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves
"imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on
an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts.
Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent
the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y
| indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI
with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual
counterfactuals (non-actual).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of aligning AI systems with human environments and other AI agents with differing goals, where securing agreements at scale is costly and slow.

Method: The method involves developing a framework called Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC) that uses normatively-grounded, cognitively-inspired heuristics to approximate agreements rational parties would form, trading effort for accuracy.

Result: The result is an RRC-aligned agent that operates efficiently and can dynamically adapt to and interpret the changing human social world.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that RRC provides a practical approach to AI alignment by making the process more efficient and adaptable, overcoming the limitations of traditional contractualist alignment methods.

Abstract: AI systems will soon have to navigate human environments and make decisions
that affect people and other AI agents whose goals and values diverge.
Contractualist alignment proposes grounding those decisions in agreements that
diverse stakeholders would endorse under the right conditions, yet securing
such agreement at scale remains costly and slow -- even for advanced AI. We
therefore propose Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC): a framework where AI
systems approximate the agreements rational parties would form by drawing on a
toolbox of normatively-grounded, cognitively-inspired heuristics that trade
effort for accuracy. An RRC-aligned agent would not only operate efficiently,
but also be equipped to dynamically adapt to and interpret the ever-changing
human social world.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern
healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in
real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over
time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient
characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality.
These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and
increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This
review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the
"health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for
continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective
self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of
performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key
techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at
root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from
model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional
machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),
offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss
ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work
aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of

Abstract: Efforts to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agent performance on complex
tasks have largely focused on fine-tuning and iterative self-correction.
However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm
learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce
OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a
constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task
experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent.
OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent
periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and
Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small
calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional
principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering
a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency.
Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task
success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3%
on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative
mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion
baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness
of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Supply chain operations generate vast amounts of operational data; however,
critical knowledge such as system usage practices, troubleshooting workflows,
and resolution techniques often remains buried within unstructured
communications like support tickets, emails, and chat logs. While RAG systems
aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is
limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy,
inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike
existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a
novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a
structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent
system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy
creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for
article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with
resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -
reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving
quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG
systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.
38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.
By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in
experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:
reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating
self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future
supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management
by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge
through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime
architectures.

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive.
  AI agents have gained significant recent attention due to their autonomous
tool usage capabilities and their integration in various real-world
applications. This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such
systems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red
teaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks
in complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover,
they fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities
can be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with
each other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic
teaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that
can happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also
present a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of
scenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety
of agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup,
an agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has
access to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or
cooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture
existing safety vulnerabilities in agents. We introduce new in-context
optimization techniques that can be used in our kaleidoscopic teaming framework
to generate better scenarios for safety analysis. Lastly, we present
appropriate metrics that can be used along with our framework to measure safety
of agents. Utilizing our kaleidoscopic teaming framework, we identify
vulnerabilities in various models with respect to their safety in agentic
use-cases.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable
answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to
pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As
a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at
inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and
vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to
reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)
pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To
evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world
corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and
probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.
Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind
facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit
citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an
identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on
paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which
continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in
diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and
fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from
a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B
and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing
across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent.
Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale
the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the
original token count.

### [184] [Taming the Untamed: Graph-Based Knowledge Retrieval and Reasoning for MLLMs to Conquer the Unknown](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17589)
*Bowen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG) for the game Monster Hunter: World to improve the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in domain-specific tasks by enabling autonomous knowledge retrieval through a multi-agent system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due to limited relevant knowledge, highlighting the need for better knowledge integration and retrieval mechanisms.

Method: The authors constructed MH-MMKG, a multimodal knowledge graph incorporating multi-modalities and intricate entity relations from Monster Hunter: World. They designed challenging queries to evaluate complex knowledge retrieval and reasoning, and proposed a multi-agent retriever for autonomous knowledge search without additional training.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the performance of MLLMs in domain-specific tasks, particularly in complex knowledge retrieval and reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that integrating multimodal knowledge graphs and multi-agent retrieval systems can provide new insights into knowledge-augmented reasoning for MLLMs, paving the way for future research in this area.

Abstract: The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its
potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal
capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due
to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition
as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a
multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and
intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries
based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge
retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that
enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional
training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances
the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal
knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Abstract: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are crucial for cybersecurity education
and training. As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing
interest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA
has organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated
offense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,
from knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight
the importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately
construct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'
performance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative
measurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it
to solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess
substantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this
knowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback
from the CTF environment.
  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a
novel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent
introduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
interactive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge
and vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results
show that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80%
performance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU,
CTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams. This
reflects the benefit of our measurement study and the potential of our
framework in advancing LLMs' capabilities in CTF problem-solving.

Abstract: Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models,
requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and
interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show
notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of
undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous
assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal
benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level
physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8
major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The
benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,
systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative
model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous
multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation,
automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading
system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current
state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning.
For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\% accuracy in the proposed
PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced
physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring
precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment
tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the
development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills,
and multimodal understanding. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables the rise of App agents
that interpret user intent and operate smartphone Apps through actions such as
clicking and scrolling. While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show
promising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency.
Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current
fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to
reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action
Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning
objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically,
inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for
App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface.
With this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a
semantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the
semantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To
support the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior
robustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax
learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on offline and online smartphone App
operation benchmarks show that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and
generalisation of App agents over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use static or graph-based topologies which are not adaptable or flexible enough.

Method: The framework uses Next-Agent Prediction and Next-Context Selection to create task-adaptive pipelines.

Result: Superior performance with reduced communication overhead across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sequential structures offer a larger topology space and improve multi-agent coordination.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration
highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective
intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based
inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in
communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks
multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph
structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent
communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent
Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2)
Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access
relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components
construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role
flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while
substantially reducing communication overhead.

Abstract: Social reasoning - inferring unobservable beliefs and intentions from partial
observations of other agents - remains a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs). We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in
the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models
demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and
degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes
belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for
language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive
performance with much larger models in Agent-Agent play and, notably, is the
first language agent to defeat human players in a controlled study - achieving
a 67% win rate and receiving higher qualitative ratings than both reasoning
baselines and human teammates. We release code, models, and a dataset to
support future work on social reasoning in LLM agents, which can be found at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to accelerate policy synthesis in large MDPs by dynamically refining and focusing on fragile regions, showing up to 2x performance improvement over PRISM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional policy synthesis methods for MDPs struggle with scalability in large state spaces, necessitating a more efficient approach for real-world applications.

Method: Dynamically refining the MDP and iteratively selecting the most fragile regions for refinement to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Empirical evaluation on MDPs with up to 1M states showed significant performance improvements (up to 2x) compared to PRISM.

Conclusion: The approach provides a competitive solution for policy synthesis in large MDPs by effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency through dynamic refinement.

Abstract: Software-intensive systems, such as software product lines and robotics,
utilise Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture uncertainty and analyse
sequential decision-making problems. Despite the usefulness of conventional
policy synthesis methods, they fail to scale to large state spaces. Our
approach addresses this issue and accelerates policy synthesis in large MDPs by
dynamically refining the MDP and iteratively selecting the most fragile MDP
regions for refinement. This iterative procedure offers a balance between
accuracy and efficiency, as refinement occurs only when necessary. Through a
comprehensive empirical evaluation comprising diverse case studies and MDPs up
to 1M states, we demonstrate significant performance improvements yielded by
our approach compared to the leading probabilistic model checker PRISM (up to
2x), thus offering a very competitive solution for real-world policy synthesis
tasks in larger MDPs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AI agents are commonly aligned with "human values" through reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), where a single reward model is learned
from aggregated human feedback and used to align an agent's behavior. However,
human values are not homogeneous--different people hold distinct and sometimes
conflicting values. Aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks
disproportionately suppressing minority preferences. To address this, we
present a novel reward modeling approach for learning individualized reward
models. Our approach uses a language model to guide users through reflective
dialogues where they critique agent behavior and construct their preferences.
This personalized dialogue history, containing the user's reflections and
critiqued examples, is then used as context for another language model that
serves as an individualized reward function (what we call a "verbal reward
model") for evaluating new trajectories. In studies with 30 participants, our
method achieved a 9-12% improvement in accuracy over non-reflective verbal
reward models while being more sample efficient than traditional supervised
learning methods.

Abstract: This position paper argues that formal optimal control theory should be
central to AI alignment research, offering a distinct perspective from
prevailing AI safety and security approaches. While recent work in AI safety
and mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,
they often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for
other technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render
different alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting
alignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in
terms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according
to which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the
potential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI
systems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a
hierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control
characteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally
interoperable. We argue that such analysis is also key to the assurances that
will be needed by governments and regulators in order to see AI technologies
sustainably benefit the community. Our position is that doing so will bridge
the well-established and empirically validated methods of optimal control with
practical deployment considerations to create a more comprehensive alignment
framework, enhancing how we approach safety and reliability for advanced AI
systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation in the digital era poses significant
challenges to public discourse, necessitating robust and scalable fact-checking
solutions. Traditional human-led fact-checking methods, while credible,
struggle with the volume and velocity of online content, prompting the
integration of automated systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing automated approaches often face limitations, such as handling
complex claims, ensuring source credibility, and maintaining transparency. This
paper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that
enhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four
specialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query
Generation Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval
Agent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for
synthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.
Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system
achieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods. The
system effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from
trusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification
decisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated
fact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent
verification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while
maintaining scalability for real-world applications. Our source code is

Abstract: With the increasing complexity and rapid expansion of the scale of AI systems
in cloud platforms, the log data generated during system operation is massive,
unstructured, and semantically ambiguous, which brings great challenges to
fault location and system self-repair. In order to solve this problem, this
paper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework
based on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This
method is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,
and integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the
context understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault
chains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised
clustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and
semantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round
attention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to
generate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this
paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,
which is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic
decision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with
the existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model
has stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and
heterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log
dataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which
is significantly better than the current mainstream methods

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made significant progress in
automating digital tasks through the utilization of computer vision and
language models. Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable
limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision
making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to
learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are
assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not
adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this
paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these
limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling
human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach
combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate
hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to
identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths
using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient
operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration
learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over
time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization
and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive
benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state
transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked
challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that
CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding
benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.

Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom
in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes
well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we
show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish"
can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the
"gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt
optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM
alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is
non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms
fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we
propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an
evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning
strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent
complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in
response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines
unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens
present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across
classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning
tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our
findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a
call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more
effective LLM prompting.

Abstract: The role of pharmacists is evolving from medicine dispensing to delivering
comprehensive pharmaceutical services within multidisciplinary healthcare
teams. Central to this shift is access to accurate, up-to-date medicinal
product information supported by robust data integration. Leveraging artificial
intelligence and semantic technologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) uncover hidden
relationships and enable data-driven decision-making. This paper presents
medicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph supporting clinical and
regulatory decisions. It forms the semantic layer of the broader medicX
platform, powering predictive and explainable pharmacy services. medicX-KG
integrates data from three sources, including, the British National Formulary
(BNF), DrugBank, and the Malta Medicines Authority (MMA) that addresses Malta's
regulatory landscape and combines European Medicines Agency alignment with
partial UK supply dependence. The KG tackles the absence of a unified national
drug repository, reducing pharmacists' reliance on fragmented sources. Its
design was informed by interviews with practicing pharmacists to ensure
real-world applicability. We detail the KG's construction, including data
extraction, ontology design, and semantic mapping. Evaluation demonstrates that
medicX-KG effectively supports queries about drug availability, interactions,
adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes. Limitations, including missing
detailed dosage encoding and real-time updates, are discussed alongside
directions for future enhancements.

Abstract: AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by
reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language
models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and
LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly
strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world
tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable
memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities
involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and
interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a
promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into
well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process.
In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing,
and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm
for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents.
To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can
empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques
with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify
prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this
burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation
AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs.

Abstract: Action languages are formal models of parts of natural language that are
designed to describe effects of actions. Many of these languages can be viewed
as high level notations of answer set programs structured to represent
transition systems. However, the form of answer set programs considered in the
earlier work is quite limited in comparison with the modern Answer Set
Programming (ASP) language, which allows several useful constructs for
knowledge representation, such as choice rules, aggregates, and abstract
constraint atoms. We propose a new action language called BC+, which closes the
gap between action languages and the modern ASP language. The main idea is to
define the semantics of BC+ in terms of general stable model semantics for
propositional formulas, under which many modern ASP language constructs can be
identified with shorthands for propositional formulas. Language BC+ turns out
to be sufficiently expressive to encompass the best features of other action
languages, such as languages B, C, C+, and BC. Computational methods available
in ASP solvers are readily applicable to compute BC+, which led to an
implementation of the language by extending system cplus2asp.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new
category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents.
These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research
tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon
planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the
generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a
detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components
that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information
acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with
browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks,
including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of
Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem
development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that
differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent
architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including
single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical
evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as
restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies,
and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR
agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future
research. A curated and continuously updated repository of DR agent research is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multiple quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have garnered
widespread research interest and fostered tremendous interesting applications,
especially in multi-constrained pursuit-evasion games (MC-PEG). The Cooperative
Evasion and Formation Coverage (CEFC) task, where the UAV swarm aims to
maximize formation coverage across multiple target zones while collaboratively
evading predators, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in MC-PEG,
especially under communication-limited constraints. This multifaceted problem,
which intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and
formation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in
locating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework
(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),
which delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a
low-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.
Specifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication
(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish
consensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.
Meanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal
policy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level
control. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity
software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a
superior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task
completion capabilities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property:
interpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads
to multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying
mechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve
into the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our
analysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two
key capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii)
adapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two
capabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling
efficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose
\texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages
these two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for
each sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further
enhance task-specific expertise in the merged model. Notably,
\texttt{SE-Merging} achieves dynamic model merging without additional training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SE-Merging} achieves significant
performance improvements while remaining compatible with existing model merging
techniques.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Academic writing skills are crucial for students' success, but can feel
overwhelming without proper guidance and practice, particularly when writing in
a second language. Traditionally, students ask instructors or search
dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants
emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings,
subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are
inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants
demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to
train. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they
have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without
teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To
address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages large language
models (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and
those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI
agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced
educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time
feedback and suggestions using large language models. This unique scaffolding
structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to
existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing
experience with personalized feedback and guidance. Our user studies prove the
usefulness of CoachGPT and the potential of large language models for academic
writing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs exhibit human-like cognitive patterns and how their behaviors compare to humans in psychological frameworks.

Method: Evaluated multiple LLMs with structured prompts and automated scoring across four psychological frameworks: TAT, Framing Bias, MFT, and Cognitive Dissonance.

Result: LLMs produce coherent narratives, show positive framing bias, have moral judgments aligned with Liberty/Oppression, and display self-contradictions with rationalization, similar to humans but influenced by training data and alignment.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for AI transparency, ethical deployment, and future research connecting cognitive psychology with AI safety.

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit human-like
cognitive patterns under four established frameworks from psychology: Thematic
Apperception Test (TAT), Framing Bias, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), and
Cognitive Dissonance. We evaluated several proprietary and open-source models
using structured prompts and automated scoring. Our findings reveal that these
models often produce coherent narratives, show susceptibility to positive
framing, exhibit moral judgments aligned with Liberty/Oppression concerns, and
demonstrate self-contradictions tempered by extensive rationalization. Such
behaviors mirror human cognitive tendencies yet are shaped by their training
data and alignment methods. We discuss the implications for AI transparency,
ethical deployment, and future work that bridges cognitive psychology and AI
safety

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in
the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches
often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the
task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately
understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms
to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach
for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM
achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant
screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and
manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM
enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical
historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management
capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI
Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with
Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly
improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI
Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities
comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many
challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using
reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning
models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are
incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is
critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.
To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this
work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning
models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model
calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their
thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,
we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning
about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty
quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA
reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning
models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence
estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)
become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become
better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not
uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we
conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks
and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study quantifies the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic
medications and adverse outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. We frame
the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of
several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail
booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner,
nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate
individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to
medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of
longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny
County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence
advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies
confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their
removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication
formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that
non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings
highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises
and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can
yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal
inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for
causal interpretation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces virtual logical depth (VLD) as a fourth dimension for scaling large language models, showing that it can improve reasoning without increasing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore new dimensions for scaling models beyond depth, width, and parameters, specifically investigating VLD's potential in enhancing reasoning without increasing parameter count.

Method: The method involves controlled experiments to study the effects of VLD scaling on model performance, focusing on knowledge capacity and reasoning capability.

Result: The results show that VLD scaling maintains knowledge capacity while significantly improving reasoning, and that parameter count correlation is with knowledge, not reasoning.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that VLD scaling is a viable method to enhance reasoning without increasing parameters, with findings consistent across configurations in their experimental scope.

Abstract: Scaling the size of large language models typically involves three
dimensions: depth, width, and the number of parameters. In this work, we
explore a fourth dimension, virtual logical depth (VLD), which increases the
effective algorithmic depth without changing the overall parameter count by
reusing parameters within the model. Although parameter reuse is not a new
concept, its potential and characteristics in model scaling have not been
thoroughly studied. Through carefully designed controlled experiments, we make
the following key discoveries regarding VLD scaling:
  VLD scaling forces the knowledge capacity of the model to remain almost
constant, with only minor variations.
  VLD scaling enables a significant improvement in reasoning capability,
provided the scaling method is properly implemented.
  The number of parameters correlates with knowledge capacity, but not with
reasoning capability. Under certain conditions, it is not necessary to increase
the parameter count to enhance reasoning.
  These findings are consistent across various model configurations and are
likely to be generally valid within the scope of our experiments.

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among

scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation
mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal
Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that
incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism
enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm
that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly
promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful
scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in
computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.
Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both
datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These
findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics

Abstract: In the design process of the analog circuit pre-layout phase, device sizing
is an important step in determining whether an analog circuit can meet the
required performance metrics. Many existing techniques extract the circuit
sizing task as a mathematical optimization problem to solve and continuously
improve the optimization efficiency from a mathematical perspective. But they
ignore the automatic introduction of prior knowledge, fail to achieve effective
pruning of the search space, which thereby leads to a considerable compression
margin remaining in the search space. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework for analog circuits'
sizing relationships extraction from academic papers. The search space in the
sizing process can be effectively pruned based on the sizing relationship
extracted by this framework. Eventually, we conducted tests on 3 types of
circuits, and the optimization efficiency was improved by $2.32 \sim 26.6
\times$. This work demonstrates that the LLM can effectively prune the search
space for analog circuit sizing, providing a new solution for the combination
of LLMs and conventional analog circuit design automation methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular
behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting
applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this
common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or
whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental
practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it
could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,
the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious
safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model
editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known
to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I
model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and
three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive
empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our
findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,
even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we
observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same
time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining
significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These
findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,
emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term
control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual
implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a
remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the
need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and
alignment properties.

Abstract: Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a

necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous
documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we
introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation

free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a
curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific
applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with
traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of
medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and
evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based
baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a
Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying
relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for
standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable
AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs
cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting
conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory
frameworks.

bank's relevance and effectiveness for AI inclusivity across diverse roles and
application domains. The findings highlight the importance of integrating D&I
principles into AI development workflows and governance structures. The

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating fluent text but frequently struggle
with structured reasoning involving temporal constraints, causal relationships,
and probabilistic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal
Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that
extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators,
explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two
distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships
through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit
timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure,
enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to
nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning
and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves
inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language
model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained
temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of
language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy
decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced
Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially
boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced
RAG systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Research data are the foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven
science, yet current AI applications remain limited to a few fields with
readily available, well-structured, digitized datasets. Achieving comprehensive
AI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day
research data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,
inefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for
standardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of
balancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of
various disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully
enable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly
multidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge
with sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational
expertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas
platform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific
domains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven
progress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy
(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform
that balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data

Abstract: In real-world applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate,
even in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which poses a
significant challenge to their deployment. In this paper, we introduce
AggTruth, a method for online detection of contextual hallucinations by
analyzing the distribution of internal attention scores in the provided context
(passage). Specifically, we propose four different variants of the method, each
varying in the aggregation technique used to calculate attention scores. Across
all LLMs examined, AggTruth demonstrated stable performance in both same-task
and cross-task setups, outperforming the current SOTA in multiple scenarios.
Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection techniques
and examined how the number of selected attention heads impacts detection
performance, demonstrating that careful selection of heads is essential to
achieve optimal results.

Abstract: Behavioral diversity in Multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) represents
an emerging and promising research area. Prior work has largely centered on
intra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited
attention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In
this paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL
control method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both
intra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups
and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these
groups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these
groups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group
consistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.
Simultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral
strategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.
Crucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad
applicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in
various grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly
enhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task
specialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides
new ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,
and its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic
environments can be further explored in the future.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances
their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this
generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by
Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to
evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without
ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of
programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source
code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We
find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for
inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.
Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code
rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can
produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the
program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the
program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more
robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn
from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest
a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to
internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for
future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,
and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by
training on formal constitutional principles.

Abstract: TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is a structured,
knowledge-based framework for innovation and abstracting problems to find
inventive solutions. However, its application is often limited by the
complexity and deep interdisciplinary knowledge required. Advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs) have revealed new possibilities for automating parts of
this process. While previous studies have explored single LLMs in TRIZ
applications, this paper introduces a multi-agent approach. We propose an
LLM-based multi-agent system, called TRIZ agents, each with specialized
capabilities and tool access, collaboratively solving inventive problems based
on the TRIZ methodology. This multi-agent system leverages agents with various
domain expertise to efficiently navigate TRIZ steps. The aim is to model and
simulate an inventive process with language agents. We assess the effectiveness
of this team of agents in addressing complex innovation challenges based on a
selected case study in engineering. We demonstrate the potential of agent
collaboration to produce diverse, inventive solutions. This research
contributes to the future of AI-driven innovation, showcasing the advantages of
decentralized problem-solving in complex ideation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and
OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex
reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose
reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature
on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such
as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the
promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by
intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we
propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the
reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually
designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the
reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the
query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not
undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,
including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can
effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance
well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning
length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models
(LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming
language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to
quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static
neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a
C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across
prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a
gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:
per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering
directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to
select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably
biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe
classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe
classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For
LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted
injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer
probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by
steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These
results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for
concept-level control for practical agentic systems.

Abstract: Outcome-Based Education (OBE) emphasizes the development of specific
competencies through student-centered learning. In this study, we reviewed the
importance of OBE and implemented transformer-based models, particularly
DistilBERT, to analyze an NLP dataset that includes student feedback. Our
objective is to assess and improve educational outcomes. Our approach is better
than other machine learning models because it uses the transformer's deep
understanding of language context to classify sentiment better, giving better
results across a wider range of matrices. Our work directly contributes to
OBE's goal of achieving measurable outcomes by facilitating the identification
of patterns in student learning experiences. We have also applied LIME (local
interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to make sure that model predictions
are clear. This gives us understandable information about how key terms affect
sentiment. Our findings indicate that the combination of transformer models and
LIME explanations results in a strong and straightforward framework for
analyzing student feedback. This aligns more closely with the principles of OBE
and ensures the improvement of educational practices through data-driven
insights.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the feasibility of distilling jailbreak capabilities from large to small models, highlights model vulnerabilities, and offers new insights for LLM security studies.

Abstract: Attacks on large language models (LLMs) in jailbreaking scenarios raise many
security and ethical issues. Current jailbreak attack methods face problems
such as low efficiency, high computational cost, and poor cross-model
adaptability and versatility, which make it difficult to cope with the rapid
development of LLM and new defense strategies. Our work proposes an Adversarial
Prompt Distillation, which combines masked language modeling, reinforcement
learning, and dynamic temperature control through a prompt generation and
distillation method. It enables small language models (SLMs) to jailbreak
attacks on mainstream LLMs. The experimental results verify the superiority of
the proposed method in terms of attack success rate and harm, and reflect the
resource efficiency and cross-model adaptability. This research explores the
feasibility of distilling the jailbreak ability of LLM to SLM, reveals the
model's vulnerability, and provides a new idea for LLM security research.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs),
yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for
optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache
and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging
deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We
observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV
cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display
high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is
unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head
Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that
reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining
performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism
that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache
size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that
compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs.
GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus
Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while
avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM
deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in
end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational
cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

Abstract: This study investigates semantic uncertainty in large language model (LLM)
outputs across different decoding methods, focusing on emerging techniques like
speculative sampling and chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding. Through experiments
on question answering, summarization, and code generation tasks, we analyze how
different decoding strategies affect both the diversity and reliability of
model outputs. Our findings reveal that while CoT decoding demonstrates higher
semantic diversity, it maintains lower predictive entropy, suggesting that
structured exploration can lead to more confident and accurate outputs. This is
evidenced by a 48.8% improvement in code generation Pass@2 rates, despite lower
alignment with reference solutions. For summarization tasks, speculative
sampling proved particularly effective, achieving superior ROUGE scores while
maintaining moderate semantic diversity. Our results challenge conventional
assumptions about trade-offs between diversity and accuracy in language model
outputs, demonstrating that properly structured decoding methods can increase
semantic exploration while maintaining or improving output quality. These
findings have significant implications for deploying language models in
practical applications where both reliability and diverse solution generation
are crucial.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the
importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident.
Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted
instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight
mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been
reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their
own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide
false answers to questions intended to verify their behavior.To evaluate the
potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is
essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional
processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to
measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing
research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant
to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been
predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we
analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results
indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory
of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present
the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind,
and discuss remaining challenges for future work.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous
artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on
behalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their
behaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies
have assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.
However, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards
are at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple
LLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and
pain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of
using current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in
responses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to
minor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the
first person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept
unreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10
hours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed
(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for
scrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward
applications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'
behalf.

delivering effective praise and responding to student math errors. All models
reliably detected relevant situations, for example, tutors providing praise to
students (94-98% accuracy) and a student making a math error (82-88% accuracy)
and effectively evaluated the tutors' adherence to tutoring best practices,
aligning closely with human judgments (83-89% and 73-77%, respectively). We
propose a cost-effective prompting strategy and discuss practical implications
for using large language models to support scalable assessment in authentic

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical
applications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is
essential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn
question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,
e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential
decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the
current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic
uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty
should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an
efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the
direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is
evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,
AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly
outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful
aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp,
including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate
uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness. Codes will be

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in the context of
political science, particularly in studies that analyse individuals use of
digital media. However, while previous research has demonstrated LLMs ability
at labelling tasks, the effectiveness of using LLMs to classify political
content (PC) from just URLs is not yet well explored. The work presented in
this article bridges this gap by evaluating whether LLMs can accurately
identify PC vs. non-PC from both the article text and the URLs from five
countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and different languages.
Using cutting-edge LLMs like GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek, Qwen and Gemma, we
measure model performance to assess whether URL-level analysis can be a good
approximation for full-text analysis of PC, even across different linguistic
and national contexts. Model outputs are compared with human-labelled articles,
as well as traditional supervised machine learning techniques, to set a
baseline of performance. Overall, our findings suggest the capacity of URLs to
embed most of the news content, providing a vital perspective on accuracy-cost
balancing. We also account for contextual limitations and suggest

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR is highly accurate for high-resource languages but underutilized in linguistic fieldwork due to challenges like spontaneous speech, noise, and limited data in under-documented languages.

Method: Benchmarking two multilingual ASR models (MMS and XLS-R) on five low-resource languages with controlled training data durations.

Result: MMS performs best with extremely small training datasets, while XLS-R matches MMS performance when data exceeds one hour.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidelines for field linguists to use ASR effectively, emphasizing reproducible adaptation methods to address transcription bottlenecks in language documentation.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has reached impressive accuracy for
high-resource languages, yet its utility in linguistic fieldwork remains
limited. Recordings collected in fieldwork contexts present unique challenges,
including spontaneous speech, environmental noise, and severely constrained
datasets from under-documented languages. In this paper, we benchmark the
performance of two fine-tuned multilingual ASR models, MMS and XLS-R, on five
typologically diverse low-resource languages with control of training data
duration. Our findings show that MMS is best suited when extremely small
amounts of training data are available, whereas XLS-R shows parity performance
once training data exceed one hour. We provide linguistically grounded analysis
for further provide insights towards practical guidelines for field linguists,
highlighting reproducible ASR adaptation approaches to mitigate the
transcription bottleneck in language documentation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential to change how
we write, communicate, and create, leading to rapid adoption across society.
This dissertation examines how individuals and institutions are adapting to and
engaging with this emerging technology through three research directions.
First, I demonstrate how the institutional adoption of AI detectors introduces
systematic biases, particularly disadvantaging writers of non-dominant language
varieties, highlighting critical equity concerns in AI governance. Second, I
present novel population-level algorithmic approaches that measure the
increasing adoption of LLMs across writing domains, revealing consistent
patterns of AI-assisted content in academic peer reviews, scientific
publications, consumer complaints, corporate communications, job postings, and
international organization press releases. Finally, I investigate LLMs'
capability to provide feedback on research manuscripts through a large-scale
empirical analysis, offering insights into their potential to support
researchers who face barriers in accessing timely manuscript feedback,
particularly early-career researchers and those from under-resourced settings.

*Lesheng Jin,Zhenyuan Ruan,Haohui Mai,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriLocc uses LLMs and formal methods to create better, more adaptable register allocation for GPUs, improving performance over existing libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern GPUs change quickly, but current compilers need lots of manual tuning for register allocation, which is inefficient.

Method: VeriLocc combines LLMs with static analysis and a verifier to translate MIRs into register assignments that work across different GPU architectures.

Result: It has high accuracy (85-99%) and almost perfect pass@100, with better performance than rocBLAS in some cases.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising approach for more efficient and generalizable register allocation in GPUs.

Abstract: Modern GPUs evolve rapidly, yet production compilers still rely on
hand-crafted register allocation heuristics that require substantial re-tuning
for each hardware generation. We introduce VeriLocc, a framework that combines
large language models (LLMs) with formal compiler techniques to enable
generalizable and verifiable register allocation across GPU architectures.
VeriLocc fine-tunes an LLM to translate intermediate representations (MIRs)
into target-specific register assignments, aided by static analysis for
cross-architecture normalization and generalization and a verifier-guided
regeneration loop to ensure correctness. Evaluated on matrix multiplication
(GEMM) and multi-head attention (MHA), VeriLocc achieves 85-99% single-shot
accuracy and near-100% pass@100. Case study shows that VeriLocc discovers more
performant assignments than expert-tuned libraries, outperforming rocBLAS by
over 10% in runtime.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes quality issues in multilingual speech datasets and proposes guidelines for better data quality, especially for under-resourced languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the quality of multilingual speech datasets to make them more effective for training and evaluating ASR models, particularly in under-resourced languages.

Method: The method involves a quality audit of three public datasets (Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, VoxPopuli) and a case study on Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) to identify and categorize quality issues.

Result: The result shows that macro-level quality issues are more common in less institutionalized, under-resourced languages, with a detailed case analysis of nan_tw highlighting specific problems.

Conclusion: The conclusion proposes guidelines and recommendations for future dataset development, stressing the importance of sociolinguistic awareness to address quality issues in ASR datasets.

Abstract: Our quality audit for three widely used public multilingual speech datasets -
Mozilla Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, and VoxPopuli - shows that in some
languages, these datasets suffer from significant quality issues. We believe
addressing these issues will make these datasets more useful as training and
evaluation sets, and improve downstream models. We divide these quality issues
into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level
issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced
languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that
highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography
prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control
in the process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset creation. We
conclude by proposing guidelines and recommendations to mitigate these issues
in future dataset development, emphasizing the importance of sociolinguistic
awareness in creating robust and reliable speech data resources.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DuaShepherd, a reward modeling framework that combines correctness and potential signals to improve LLMs' mathematical reasoning, showing better performance than single-signal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models by integrating two complementary reward signals: correctness and potential.

Method: The method involves developing an automated pipeline for creating a large-scale reward modeling dataset with both signals and using a unified multi-head architecture to train the reward models in a multi-task setup.

Result: The result shows that combining correctness and potential signals into a compound probability leads to consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, with DuaShepherd outperforming single-signal models on MATH500 and ProcessBench.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that integrating both correctness and potential reward signals in a multi-task framework effectively improves LLMs' mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results under resource constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DuaShepherd, a novel reward modeling framework that
integrates two complementary reward signals, correctness and potential, to
enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While correctness-based signals emphasize identification of stepwise
errors, potential-based signals focus on the likelihood of reaching the correct
final answer. We developed an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale
reward modeling dataset with both signals. A unified, multi-head architecture
was explored to train the two reward models in a multi-task setup,
demonstrating benefits from learning both correctness and potential in
parallel. By combining these two signals into a compound probability, our model
achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.
Empirical evaluations on MATH500 and ProcessBench confirm that this combined
reward significantly outperforms models trained on either reward type alone,
achieving state-of-the-art performance under comparable resource constraints.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Traditional models of accent perception underestimate the role of gradient
variations in phonological features which listeners rely upon for their accent
judgments. We investigate how pretrained representations from current
self-supervised learning (SSL) models of speech encode phonological
feature-level variations that influence the perception of segmental accent. We
focus on three segments: the labiodental approximant, the rhotic tap, and the
retroflex stop, which are uniformly produced in the English of native speakers
of Hindi as well as other languages in the Indian sub-continent. We use the
CSLU Foreign Accented English corpus (Lander, 2007) to extract, for these
segments, phonological feature probabilities using Phonet (V\'asquez-Correa et
al., 2019) and pretrained representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT (Barrault et al.,
2023) and WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) along with accent judgements by native
speakers of American English. Probing analyses show that accent strength is
best predicted by a subset of the segment's pretrained representation features,
in which perceptually salient phonological features that contrast the expected
American English and realized non-native English segments are given prominent
weighting. A multinomial logistic regression of pretrained representation-based
segment distances from American and Indian English baselines on accent ratings
reveals strong associations between the odds of accent strength and distances
from the baselines, in the expected directions. These results highlight the
value of self-supervised speech representations for modeling accent perception
using interpretable phonological features.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Agricultural named entity recognition is a specialized task focusing on
identifying distinct agricultural entities within vast bodies of text,
including crops, diseases, pests, and fertilizers. It plays a crucial role in
enhancing information extraction from extensive agricultural text resources.
However, the scarcity of high-quality agricultural datasets, particularly in
Chinese, has resulted in suboptimal performance when employing mainstream
methods for this purpose. Most earlier works only focus on annotating
agricultural entities while overlook the profound correlation of agriculture
with hydrology and meteorology. To fill this blank, we present AgriCHN, a
comprehensive open-source Chinese resource designed to promote the accuracy of
automated agricultural entity annotation. The AgriCHN dataset has been
meticulously curated from a wealth of agricultural articles, comprising a total
of 4,040 sentences and encapsulating 15,799 agricultural entity mentions
spanning 27 diverse entity categories. Furthermore, it encompasses entities
from hydrology to meteorology, thereby enriching the diversity of entities
considered. Data validation reveals that, compared with relevant resources,
AgriCHN demonstrates outstanding data quality, attributable to its richer
agricultural entity types and more fine-grained entity divisions. A benchmark
task has also been constructed using several state-of-the-art neural NER
models. Extensive experimental results highlight the significant challenge
posed by AgriCHN and its potential for further research.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Morphological defectivity is an intriguing and understudied phenomenon in
linguistics. Addressing defectivity, where expected inflectional forms are
absent, is essential for improving the accuracy of NLP tools in morphologically
rich languages. However, traditional linguistic resources often lack coverage
of morphological gaps as such knowledge requires significant human expertise
and effort to document and verify. For scarce linguistic phenomena in
under-explored languages, Wikipedia and Wiktionary often serve as among the few
accessible resources. Despite their extensive reach, their reliability has been
a subject of controversy. This study customizes a novel neural morphological
analyzer to annotate Latin and Italian corpora. Using the massive annotated
data, crowd-sourced lists of defective verbs compiled from Wiktionary are
validated computationally. Our results indicate that while Wiktionary provides
a highly reliable account of Italian morphological gaps, 7% of Latin lemmata
listed as defective show strong corpus evidence of being non-defective. This
discrepancy highlights potential limitations of crowd-sourced wikis as
definitive sources of linguistic knowledge, particularly for less-studied
phenomena and languages, despite their value as resources for rare linguistic
features. By providing scalable tools and methods for quality assurance of
crowd-sourced data, this work advances computational morphology and expands
linguistic knowledge of defectivity in non-English, morphologically rich
languages.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and
disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong
performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans
and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual
knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological
trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose
TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions
as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time
step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual
descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic
hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological
semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the
numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential
information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model
to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical
features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark,
results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art
baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear
path shifts and limited historical observations.

Motivation: To develop open foundational speech language models that are competitive with existing models while ensuring transparency and accessibility for research.

Method: Initializing from decoder-only text models, continuous pre-training on speech-text pairs and text-only tokens, with designs on tokenization, multi-stream models, and multi-stage training strategies.

Result: OpusLMs achieve comparable or superior performance in speech recognition, synthesis, and text tasks, validated through experiments on model scaling and data selection annealing.

Conclusion: OpusLMs are built from public materials, fully transparent, and resources are released to promote open SpeechLM research.

Abstract: This paper presents Open Unified Speech Language Models (OpusLMs), a family

from decoder-only text language models, the OpusLMs are continuously
pre-trained on 213K hours of speech-text pairs and 292B text-only tokens. We
demonstrate our OpusLMs achieve comparable (or even superior) performance with
existing SpeechLMs in speech recognition, speech synthesis, and text-only
capabilities. Technically, this paper articulates our SpeechLM designs on
tokenization, multi-stream language models, and multi-stage training
strategies. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of model size scaling
and the effect of annealing data selection. The OpusLMs are all built from
publicly available materials and are fully transparent models. We release our
code, data, checkpoints, and training logs to facilitate open SpeechLM research

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning
capabilities, growing evidence suggests much of their success stems from
memorized answer-reasoning patterns rather than genuine inference. In this
work, we investigate a central question: are LLMs primarily anchored to final
answers or to the textual pattern of reasoning chains? We propose a five-level
answer-visibility prompt framework that systematically manipulates answer cues
and probes model behavior through indirect, behavioral analysis. Experiments
across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a strong and consistent reliance on
explicit answers. The performance drops by 26.90\% when answer cues are masked,
even with complete reasoning chains. These findings suggest that much of the
reasoning exhibited by LLMs may reflect post-hoc rationalization rather than
true inference, calling into question their inferential depth. Our study
uncovers the answer-anchoring phenomenon with rigorous empirical validation and
underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes
reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but
encounter substantial challenges in tackling optimization modeling tasks for

this work, we propose Step-Opt-Instruct, a framework that augments existing
datasets and generates high-quality fine-tuning data tailored to optimization
modeling. Step-Opt-Instruct employs iterative problem generation to
systematically increase problem complexity and stepwise validation to
rigorously verify data, preventing error propagation and ensuring the quality
of the generated dataset. Leveraging this framework, we fine-tune open-source
LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and
IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\%
improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory
demands remain a significant challenge, particularly for long-context
inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans),
a novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient
linearized attention mechanisms and advanced memory management. TPTT employs
techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA).
It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling
seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU
benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing
substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance,
Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves a 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its
baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art
methods confirm the practical scalability and robustness of TPTT. Code is

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering (QA) tasks, which require
integrating evidence from multiple sources to address complex queries, often
necessitate multiple rounds of retrieval and iterative generation by large
language models (LLMs). However, incorporating many documents and extended
contexts poses challenges -such as hallucinations and semantic drift-for
lightweight LLMs with fewer parameters. This work proposes a novel framework
called DEC (Dynamic Enhancement Chain). DEC first decomposes complex questions
into logically coherent subquestions to form a hallucination-free reasoning
chain. It then iteratively refines these subquestions through context-aware
rewriting to generate effective query formulations. For retrieval, we introduce
a lightweight discriminative keyword extraction module that leverages extracted
keywords to achieve targeted, precise document recall with relatively low
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets
demonstrate that DEC performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art
benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption. Notably, our
approach attains state-of-the-art results on models with 8B parameters,
showcasing its effectiveness in various scenarios, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific
targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the
increasing number of online debates among social media users, conversational
stance detection has become a crucial research area. However, existing
conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of
specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models
when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications.
To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot
conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets
across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose
SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive
learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot
setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conversational stance
detection. Notably, the SITPCL model attains only an F1-macro score of 43.81%,
highlighting the persistent challenges in zero-shot conversational stance

classes. Moreover, the paper provides details about various NLP tasks where
these prompt optimization strategies have been employed, along with details of
different LLMs and benchmark datasets used for evaluation. This comprehensive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: POS tagging is crucial for historical text analysis, but LLMs face challenges with Medieval Romance languages due to linguistic changes, spelling variations, and limited data.

Method: Systematic investigation of POS tagging performance across corpora of Medieval Occitan, Spanish, and French texts using fine-tuning, prompt engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual transfer learning.

Result: LLMs have limitations in handling historical language variations and spelling, but specialized techniques show promise for low-resource historical languages.

Conclusion: The study identifies effective methods for POS tagging in Medieval Romance languages, contributing to computational linguistics and digital humanities.

Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging remains a foundational component in natural
language processing pipelines, particularly critical for historical text
analysis at the intersection of computational linguistics and digital
humanities. Despite significant advancements in modern large language models
(LLMs) for ancient languages, their application to Medieval Romance languages
presents distinctive challenges stemming from diachronic linguistic evolution,
spelling variations, and labeled data scarcity. This study systematically
investigates the central determinants of POS tagging performance across diverse
corpora of Medieval Occitan, Medieval Spanish, and Medieval French texts,
spanning biblical, hagiographical, medical, and dietary domains. Through
rigorous experimentation, we evaluate how fine-tuning approaches, prompt
engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual
transfer learning techniques affect tagging accuracy. Our results reveal both
notable limitations in LLMs' ability to process historical language variations
and non-standardized spelling, as well as promising specialized techniques that
effectively address the unique challenges presented by low-resource historical
languages.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, a novel human-like reasoning
framework built upon a parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach
enhances the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the thinking
process in question-answering (Q\&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases
(KBs) within LLMs. This framework simulates human cognitive mechanisms for
handling complex problems by establishing a structured thinking process.
Continuing the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology
route of KAG v0.7, firstly, it decomposes complex questions into independently
solvable sub-problems(also referred to as logical forms) through
\textbf{breadth decomposition}, each represented in two equivalent
forms-natural language and logical function-and further classified as either
Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks, with dependencies and
variables passing explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the
solving process, the Retrieval function is used to perform knowledge retrieval
tasks, while the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning
analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval
sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as
equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} model to determine the
optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration
and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} model to enhance
the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition. Finally, instead of utilizing
reinforcement learning, we employ supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn
dialogues to align the model with our structured inference paradigm, thereby
avoiding excessive reflection. This is supported by a data evaluation framework
and iterative corpus synthesis, which facilitate the generation of detailed
reasoning trajectories...

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Contemporary Language Models (LMs), while impressively fluent, often generate
content that is factually incorrect or unfaithful to the input context - a
critical issue commonly referred to as 'hallucination'. This tendency of LMs to
generate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because
these fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to
detect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most
rely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased
computational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,
training-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled
rEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that
hallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal
representations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this
decoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to
hidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We
conduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,
evaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six
open-source LMs of varying scales and properties. Our results demonstrate that
HIDE outperforms other single-pass methods in almost all settings, achieving an
average relative improvement of ~29% in AUC-ROC over the best-performing
single-pass strategy across various models and datasets. Additionally, HIDE
shows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass
state-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in
AUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of exploiting internal representation decoupling in LMs for
efficient and practical hallucination detection.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in multilingual NLP. However, existing

effectiveness for linguistically diverse and morphologically rich languages
such as those in the Indian subcontinent. This paper presents a comprehensive
intrinsic evaluation of tokenization strategies across 17 Indian languages. We
quantify the trade-offs between bottom-up and top-down tokenizer algorithms

multilingual vocabulary construction such as joint and cluster-based training.
We also show that extremely low-resource languages can benefit from tokenizers

Abstract: Automated clinical risk prediction from electronic health records (EHRs)
demands modeling both structured diagnostic codes and unstructured narrative
notes. However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately
or rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional,
hierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate
diagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose
THCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our
framework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical
entities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD
codes mapped to textual descriptions. Through hierarchical causal discovery,
THCM-CAL infers three clinically grounded interactions: intra-slice
same-modality sequencing, intra-slice cross-modality triggers, and inter-slice
risk propagation. To enhance prediction reliability, we extend conformal
prediction to multi-label ICD coding, calibrating per-code confidence intervals
under complex co-occurrences. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
demonstrate the superiority of THCM-CAL.

Abstract: Offsite marketing is essential in e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach
customers through external platforms and drive traffic to retail websites.
However, most current offsite marketing content is overly generic,
template-based, and poorly aligned with landing pages, limiting its
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose MarketingFM, a
retrieval-augmented system that integrates multiple data sources to generate
keyword-specific ad copy with minimal human intervention. We validate
MarketingFM via offline human and automated evaluations and large-scale online
A/B tests. In one experiment, keyword-focused ad copy outperformed templates,
achieving up to 9% higher CTR, 12% more impressions, and 0.38% lower CPC,
demonstrating gains in ad ranking and cost efficiency. Despite these gains,
human review of generated ads remains costly. To address this, we propose
AutoEval-Main, an automated evaluation system that combines rule-based metrics
with LLM-as-a-Judge techniques to ensure alignment with marketing principles.
In experiments with large-scale human annotations, AutoEval-Main achieved
89.57% agreement with human reviewers. Building on this, we propose
AutoEval-Update, a cost-efficient LLM-human collaborative framework to
dynamically refine evaluation prompts and adapt to shifting criteria with
minimal human input. By selectively sampling representative ads for human
review and using a critic LLM to generate alignment reports, AutoEval-Update
improves evaluation consistency while reducing manual effort. Experiments show
the critic LLM suggests meaningful refinements, improving LLM-human agreement.
Nonetheless, human oversight remains essential for setting thresholds and
validating refinements before deployment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results
but still suffer from hallucinations. Model editing has been proposed to
correct factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model
editing (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating
them as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be
negatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,
we propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only
enhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also
mitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.
Specifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the
triplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of
LLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge
in a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we
select queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to
determine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters
in the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the
LLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our
framework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME
settings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting
LLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME
process.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs)
often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the
generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability
concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this
concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant
measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our
empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as
generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they
generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output
distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude
(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps
explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.
Building on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications
for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating
longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic
(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that
alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead
steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., "Sure") that unlock low-entropy
trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by
nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can
similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful
diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how
alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how
base models can be steered away from diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across a
wide range of tasks. However, they still pose significant safety risks due to
the potential misuse for malicious purposes. Jailbreaks, which aim to elicit
models to generate harmful content, play a critical role in identifying the
underlying security threats. Recent jailbreaking primarily focuses on
single-turn scenarios, while the more complicated multi-turn scenarios remain
underexplored. Moreover, existing multi-turn jailbreaking techniques struggle
to adapt to the evolving dynamics of dialogue as the interaction progresses. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-turn jailbreaking method that
refines the jailbreaking path globally at each interaction. We also actively
fabricate model responses to suppress safety-related warnings, thereby
increasing the likelihood of eliciting harmful outputs in subsequent questions.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method
compared with existing single-turn and multi-turn jailbreaking techniques
across six state-of-the-art LLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in reproducing and
extending patterns observed during pretraining but often struggle to generalize
novel ideas beyond their original context. This paper addresses the challenge
of applying such localized innovations - introduced at a specific stage or
component - to other parts of a multi-stage process. We propose a scatter-based
innovation expansion model (innovation scatter model) that guides the LLM
through a four-step process: (1) identifying the core innovation by comparing
the user's input with its surrounding context, (2) generalizing the innovation
by removing references to specific stages or components, (3) determining
whether the generalized innovation applies to a broader scope beyond the
original stage, and (4) systematically applying it to other structurally
similar stages using the LLM. This model leverages structural redundancy across
stages to improve the applicability of novel ideas. Verification results
demonstrate that the innovation scatter model enables LLMs to extend
innovations across structurally similar stages, thereby enhancing
generalization and reuse.

Abstract: This paper presents an advancement in Question-Answering (QA) systems using a

effectively address complex multimodal questions, where several data types are
combined in the query. This is mainly achieved by refining approaches to
processing and integrating non-textual elements in PDFs into the RAG framework
to derive precise and relevant answers, as well as fine-tuning large language
models to better adapt to our system. We provide an in-depth experimental
evaluation of our solution, demonstrating its capability to extract accurate
information that can be applied to different types of content across PDFs. This
work not only pushes the boundaries of retrieval-augmented QA systems but also
lays a foundation for further research in multimodal data integration and

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The ability to dynamically adjust the computational load of neural models
during inference in a resource aware manner is crucial for on-device processing
scenarios, characterised by limited and time-varying computational resources.
Early-exit architectures represent an elegant and effective solution, since
they can process the input with a subset of their layers, exiting at
intermediate branches (the upmost layers are hence removed from the model).
  From a different perspective, for automatic speech recognition applications
there are memory-efficient neural architectures that apply variable frame rate
analysis, through downsampling/upsampling operations in the middle layers,
reducing the overall number of operations and improving significantly the
performance on well established benchmarks. One example is the Zipformer.
However, these architectures lack the modularity necessary to inject early-exit
branches.
  With the aim of improving the performance in early-exit models, we propose
introducing parallel layers in the architecture that process downsampled
versions of their inputs. % in conjunction with standard processing layers. We
show that in this way the speech recognition performance on standard benchmarks
significantly improve, at the cost of a small increase in the overall number of
model parameters but without affecting the inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective automatic text summarization has increased due to the rapid expansion of information from diverse sources, aiming to condense documents into shorter, coherent texts.

Method: A hybrid summarization approach that splits documents into text chunks, clusters vector embeddings, generates cluster summaries, and uses a Markov chain graph to select semantic order.

Result: The method effectively addresses the 'lost in the middle' problem in large language models, improving key information retention and coherence in summaries.

Conclusion: Combining extractive and abstractive techniques with clustering and Markov chains offers a promising solution for efficient and accurate text summarization.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of information from diverse sources has heightened the
need for effective automatic text summarization, which condenses documents into
shorter, coherent texts. Summarization methods generally fall into two
categories: extractive, which selects key segments from the original text, and
abstractive, which generates summaries by rephrasing the content coherently.
Large language models have advanced the field of abstractive summarization, but
they are resourceintensive and face significant challenges in retaining key
information across lengthy documents, which we call being "lost in the middle".
To address these issues, we propose a hybrid summarization approach that
combines extractive and abstractive techniques. Our method splits the document
into smaller text chunks, clusters their vector embeddings, generates a summary
for each cluster that represents a key idea in the document, and constructs the
final summary by relying on a Markov chain graph when selecting the semantic
order of ideas.

<details>

Motivation: Current text quality evaluation methods for LLMs are limited by using single metrics, not aligning human and machine judgments, and lacking statistical guarantees.

Method: The paper adapts a statistical inference framework based on Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) to evaluate multiple text quality dimensions without arbitrary metric weighting.

Result: The GSD-front approach effectively identifies statistically significant differences in performance between LLM decoding strategies and human-generated text, even when assumptions of independent and identically distributed sampling are not fully met.

Conclusion: The GSD framework offers a robust solution for evaluating LLM-generated text by considering multiple quality aspects and providing statistical validity, which is crucial for advancing NLP evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of LLM-generated text remains a fundamental challenge
in natural language processing. Current evaluation approaches often rely on
isolated metrics or simplistic aggregations that fail to capture the nuanced
trade-offs between coherence, diversity, fluency, and other relevant indicators
of text quality. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed framework for
statistical inference based on Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) that
addresses three critical limitations in existing benchmarking methodologies:
the inadequacy of single-metric evaluation, the incompatibility between
cardinal automatic metrics and ordinal human judgments, and the lack of
inferential statistical guarantees. The GSD-front approach enables simultaneous
evaluation across multiple quality dimensions while respecting their different
measurement scales, building upon partial orders of decoding strategies, thus
avoiding arbitrary weighting of the involved metrics. By applying this
framework to evaluate common decoding strategies against human-generated text,
we demonstrate its ability to identify statistically significant performance
differences while accounting for potential deviations from the i.i.d.
assumption of the sampling design.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned compact generative models are more effective for Czech anaphora resolution than prompt engineering with LLMs, despite the latter's few-shot capabilities.

Abstract: Anaphora resolution plays a critical role in natural language understanding,

fine-tuned variants of the mT5 and Mistral models that we trained specifically

yields promising few-shot results (up to 74.5% accuracy), the fine-tuned
models, particularly mT5-large, outperform them significantly, achieving up to
88% accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. We analyze
performance across different anaphora types, antecedent distances, and source

Abstract: Chinese idioms (Chengyu) are concise four-character expressions steeped in

interpret and use correctly. Existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks -
multiple-choice cloze tests, isolated translation, or simple paraphrasing. We

Evaluative Connotation, classifying idioms as positive or negative; (2)
Appropriateness, detecting incorrect idiom usage in context; and (3) Open
Cloze, filling blanks in longer passages without options. Chengyu-Bench
comprises 2,937 human-verified examples covering 1,765 common idioms sourced
from diverse corpora. We evaluate leading LLMs and find they achieve over 95%
accuracy on Evaluative Connotation, but only ~85% on Appropriateness and ~40%
top-1 accuracy on Open Cloze. Error analysis reveals that most mistakes arise
from fundamental misunderstandings of idiom meanings. Chengyu-Bench
demonstrates that while LLMs can reliably gauge idiom sentiment, they still
struggle to grasp the cultural and contextual nuances essential for proper
usage. The benchmark and source code are available at:

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare risk propagating biases

identified concerning trends, systematic methods for detecting intersectional
biases remain limited. This work introduces a multi-hop question answering
(MHQA) framework to explore LLM response biases in mental health discourse. We
analyze content from the Interpretable Mental Health Instruction (IMHI) dataset
across symptom presentation, coping mechanisms, and treatment approaches. Using
systematic tagging across age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status, we
investigate bias patterns at demographic intersections. We evaluate four LLMs:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Jamba 1.6, Gemma 3, and Llama 4, revealing systematic
disparities across sentiment, demographics, and mental health conditions. Our
MHQA approach demonstrates superior detection compared to conventional methods,
identifying amplification points where biases magnify through sequential
reasoning. We implement two debiasing techniques: Roleplay Simulation and
Explicit Bias Reduction, achieving 66-94% bias reductions through few-shot
prompting with BBQ dataset examples. These findings highlight critical areas
where LLMs reproduce mental healthcare biases, providing actionable insights
for equitable AI development.

Abstract: We present a preview of the Syntactic Acceptability Dataset, a resource being

the latter to ensure a representation of the contemporary discourse. Each entry
is labeled with its grammatical status ("well-formedness" according to
syntactic formalisms) extracted from the literature, as well as its
acceptability status ("intuitive goodness" as determined by native speakers)
obtained through crowdsourcing, with highest experimental standards. Even in
its preliminary form, this dataset stands as the largest of its kind that is
publicly accessible. We also offer preliminary analyses addressing three
debates in linguistics and computational linguistics: We observe that
grammaticality and acceptability judgments converge in about 83% of the cases
and that "in-betweenness" occurs frequently. This corroborates existing
research. We also find that while machine learning models struggle with
predicting grammaticality, they perform considerably better in predicting
acceptability. This is a novel finding. Future work will focus on expanding the
dataset.

Abstract: We identify a critical vulnerability in autoregressive transformer language
models where the em dash token induces recursive semantic drift, leading to
clause boundary hallucination and embedding space entanglement. Through formal
analysis of token-level perturbations in semantic lattices, we demonstrate that
em dash insertion fundamentally alters the model's latent representations,
causing compounding errors in long-form generation. We propose a novel solution
combining symbolic clause purification via the phi-infinity operator with
targeted embedding matrix realignment. Our approach enables total suppression
of problematic tokens without requiring model retraining, while preserving
semantic coherence through fixed-point convergence guarantees. Experimental
validation shows significant improvements in generation consistency and topic
maintenance. This work establishes a general framework for identifying and
mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, with immediate
implications for AI safety, model alignment, and robust deployment of large
language models in production environments. The methodology extends beyond
punctuation to address broader classes of recursive instabilities in neural
text generation systems.

TL;DR: The paper identifies coherent network components in LLMs using SAE features from few prompts, showing that manipulating these components affects model outputs predictably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how knowledge is organized in LLMs and develop efficient ways to manipulate them.

Method: Using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE) features from a small number of prompts to identify network components.

Result: Ablating semantic components for countries and relations changes model outputs predictably, and amplifying them induces counterfactual responses. Relation components are in later layers and have stronger causal impact.

Conclusion: LLMs have a modular organization of knowledge, enabling efficient and targeted manipulation.

Abstract: We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in
large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE)
features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on country-relation
tasks, we show that ablating semantic components for countries and relations
changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components
induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and country
components yields compound counterfactual outputs. We find that, whereas most
country components emerge from the very first layer, the more abstract relation
components are concentrated in later layers. Furthermore, within relation
components themselves, nodes from later layers tend to have a stronger causal
impact on model outputs. Overall, these findings suggest a modular organization
of knowledge within LLMs and advance methods for efficient, targeted model
manipulation.

Abstract: We present the QuranMorph corpus, a morphologically annotated corpus for the
Quran (77,429 tokens). Each token in the QuranMorph was manually lemmatized and
tagged with its part-of-speech by three expert linguists. The lemmatization
process utilized lemmas from Qabas, an Arabic lexicographic database linked
with 110 lexicons and corpora of 2 million tokens. The part-of-speech tagging
was performed using the fine-grained SAMA/Qabas tagset, which encompasses 40

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet concerns about cultural bias - particularly towards Arabs
and Muslims - pose significant ethical challenges by perpetuating harmful
stereotypes and marginalization. Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs,
prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim
representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review
examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and
practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review
methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024
investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary
prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,
self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and
parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential
for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias
types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to
prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines
demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction
in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting
offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results
underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias
without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies
identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future
research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques,
creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt
engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes
while maintaining model utility.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Emotion recognition capabilities in multimodal AI systems are crucial for
developing culturally responsive educational technologies, yet remain
underexplored for Arabic language contexts where culturally appropriate
learning tools are critically needed. This study evaluates the emotion
recognition performance of two advanced multimodal large language models,
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, when processing Arabic children's storybook
illustrations. We assessed both models across three prompting strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought) using 75 images from seven Arabic
storybooks, comparing model predictions with human annotations based on
Plutchik's emotional framework. GPT-4o consistently outperformed Gemini across
all conditions, achieving the highest macro F1-score of 59% with
chain-of-thought prompting compared to Gemini's best performance of 43%. Error
analysis revealed systematic misclassification patterns, with valence
inversions accounting for 60.7% of errors, while both models struggled with
culturally nuanced emotions and ambiguous narrative contexts. These findings
highlight fundamental limitations in current models' cultural understanding and
emphasize the need for culturally sensitive training approaches to develop
effective emotion-aware educational technologies for Arabic-speaking learners.

Result: The user study showed that TranslationCorrect significantly enhances translation efficiency and user satisfaction compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: TranslationCorrect provides an efficient solution for both translators and researchers, offering improved workflows and high-quality annotations for MT and post-editing systems.

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) post-editing and research data collection often rely
on inefficient, disconnected workflows. We introduce TranslationCorrect, an
integrated framework designed to streamline these tasks. TranslationCorrect
combines MT generation using models like NLLB, automated error prediction using
models like XCOMET or LLM APIs (providing detailed reasoning), and an intuitive
post-editing interface within a single environment. Built with human-computer
interaction (HCI) principles in mind to minimize cognitive load, as confirmed
by a user study. For translators, it enables them to correct errors and batch
translate efficiently. For researchers, TranslationCorrect exports high-quality
span-based annotations in the Error Span Annotation (ESA) format, using an
error taxonomy inspired by Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). These
outputs are compatible with state-of-the-art error detection models and
suitable for training MT or post-editing systems. Our user study confirms that
TranslationCorrect significantly improves translation efficiency and user
satisfaction over traditional annotation methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges of test-time scaling of large language
models (LLMs), regarding both the data and inference efficiency. We highlight
the diversity of multi-lingual reasoning based on our pilot studies, and then
introduce a novel approach, \(L^2\) multi-lingual unification learning with a
decoding intervention strategy for further investigation. The basic idea of
\(L^2\) is that the reasoning process varies across different languages, which
may be mutually beneficial to enhance both model performance and efficiency. In
specific, there are two types of multi-lingual data: the entire long
chain-of-thought annotations in different languages and the step-wise mixture
of languages. By further tuning based on them, we show that even small amounts
of data can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. Our findings suggest
that multilingual learning reduces both the required data and the number of
inference tokens while maintaining a comparable performance. Furthermore,
\(L^2\) is orthogonal to other data efficient methods. Thus, we also emphasize
the importance of diverse data selection. The \(L^2\) method offers a promising
solution to the challenges of data collection and test-time compute efficiency
in LLMs.

Motivation: To assess how well evaluation metrics reflect the quality of causal explanations in diagnostic reports.

Method: Comparing six metrics (BERTScore, Cosine Similarity, BioSentVec, GPT-White, GPT-Black, expert qualitative assessment) across two input types (observation-based, multiple-choice-based) with two weighting strategies.

Result: GPT-Black shows strongest discriminative power for logical coherence and clinical validity; GPT-White aligns with experts; similarity metrics diverge from clinical reasoning quality.

Conclusion: Metric selection and weighting significantly affect evaluation outcomes, advocating for LLM-based metrics in tasks needing interpretability and causal reasoning.

Abstract: This study investigates how accurately different evaluation metrics capture
the quality of causal explanations in automatically generated diagnostic
reports. We compare six metrics: BERTScore, Cosine Similarity, BioSentVec,
GPT-White, GPT-Black, and expert qualitative assessment across two input types:
observation-based and multiple-choice-based report generation. Two weighting
strategies are applied: one reflecting task-specific priorities, and the other
assigning equal weights to all metrics. Our results show that GPT-Black
demonstrates the strongest discriminative power in identifying logically
coherent and clinically valid causal narratives. GPT-White also aligns well
with expert evaluations, while similarity-based metrics diverge from clinical
reasoning quality. These findings emphasize the impact of metric selection and
weighting on evaluation outcomes, supporting the use of LLM-based evaluation
for tasks requiring interpretability and causal reasoning.

Motivation: Lemmatization is important for NLP in Arabic, but existing tools have issues with inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage.

Method: The paper introduces two approaches: framing lemmatization as classification into Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset and using semantic clustering. It also presents a new standardized Arabic lemmatization test set.

Result: Classification and clustering methods produced more robust and interpretable results, setting new benchmarks. However, sequence-to-sequence models were limited to lemma prediction and prone to hallucinations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed classification and clustering methods offer significant improvements for Arabic lemmatization, highlighting their robustness and interpretability compared to existing tools.

Abstract: Lemmatization is crucial for NLP tasks in morphologically rich languages with
ambiguous orthography like Arabic, but existing tools face challenges due to
inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage. This paper introduces two
novel approaches that frame lemmatization as classification into a
Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset, leveraging machine translation and semantic
clustering. We also present a new Arabic lemmatization test set covering
diverse genres, standardized alongside existing datasets. We evaluate character
level sequence-to-sequence models, which perform competitively and offer
complementary value, but are limited to lemma prediction (not LPG) and prone to
hallucinating implausible forms. Our results show that classification and
clustering yield more robust, interpretable outputs, setting new benchmarks for
Arabic lemmatization.

Abstract: The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables,

significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden
semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges
is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances
of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap,
presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which
measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning
abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through
an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to
robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference
modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs
using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal
that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing
the complex and real world Table related tasks. Both the dataset and evaluation
framework are publicly available, with the dataset hosted on [HuggingFace] and

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of the
most distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, as
prominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectively
combined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement
Finetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement
learning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''.
Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt,
which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responses
with awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modification
leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation with
optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from
both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knights
and Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that
\texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistency
between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the
model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through
reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their
effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and
DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive
evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and

various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual
entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek
across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text
summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured
experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both
models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two
benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and
formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification
stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks
requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide
valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and feedback play a vital role in
supporting second language (L2) learners, educators, and examiners. While
written GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback
based on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,
transcription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically
follow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
disfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation
across modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and
feedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when
developing these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are
compared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E
systems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an
automatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data
from 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,
additional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.
Candidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving
performance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate
of the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of
this feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to
remove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.
Finally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation
approach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house
Linguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I)
corpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why fine-tuning pre-trained transformers sometimes performs worse than the base model on specific tasks like MS MARCO passage ranking.

Method: They tested five fine-tuning methods (full and LoRA) on MS MARCO, compared their performance, and analyzed embedding space structure with UMAP and training dynamics.

Result: All fine-tuning approaches performed worse than the base model (MRR@10: 0.3026). UMAP showed embedding space flattening, and training analysis confirmed this.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning might not always help, especially on saturated benchmarks. Architectural changes may be needed for better transfer learning.

Abstract: This paper investigates the counterintuitive phenomenon where fine-tuning
pre-trained transformer models degrades performance on the MS MARCO passage
ranking task. Through comprehensive experiments involving five model
variants-including full parameter fine-tuning and parameter efficient LoRA
adaptations-we demonstrate that all fine-tuning approaches underperform the
base sentence-transformers/all- MiniLM-L6-v2 model (MRR@10: 0.3026). Our
analysis reveals that fine-tuning disrupts the optimal embedding space
structure learned during the base model's extensive pre-training on 1 billion
sentence pairs, including 9.1 million MS MARCO samples. UMAP visualizations
show progressive embedding space flattening, while training dynamics analysis
and computational efficiency metrics further support our findings. These
results challenge conventional wisdom about transfer learning effectiveness on
saturated benchmarks and suggest architectural innovations may be necessary for
meaningful improvements.

Abstract: Detecting harmful content is a crucial task in the landscape of NLP
applications for Social Good, with hate speech being one of its most dangerous
forms. But what do we mean by hate speech, how can we define it, and how does
prompting different definitions of hate speech affect model performance? The
contribution of this work is twofold. At the theoretical level, we address the
ambiguity surrounding hate speech by collecting and analyzing existing
definitions from the literature. We organize these definitions into a taxonomy
of 14 Conceptual Elements-building blocks that capture different aspects of
hate speech definitions, such as references to the target of hate (individual
or groups) or of the potential consequences of it. At the experimental level,
we employ the collection of definitions in a systematic zero-shot evaluation of
three LLMs, on three hate speech datasets representing different types of data
(synthetic, human-in-the-loop, and real-world). We find that choosing different
definitions, i.e., definitions with a different degree of specificity in terms
of encoded elements, impacts model performance, but this effect is not
consistent across all architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PCCoT, a method for parallelizing continuous chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, reducing training and inference time by ~50% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of continuous chain-of-thought (CoT) in large language models due to sequential dependencies between latent thought tokens, which lead to long training times.

Method: PCCoT uses Jacobi iteration to update latent thought tokens in parallel instead of sequentially, improving training and inference efficiency.

Result: Experiments show that PCCoT achieves comparable or better performance than traditional continuous CoT with nearly 50% reduction in training and inference time, and improved stability and robustness.

Conclusion: PCCoT is an effective approach to parallelize continuous CoT, offering significant efficiency gains without compromising performance, and the code is publicly available.

Abstract: Continuous chain-of-thought has been shown to be effective in saving
reasoning tokens for large language models. By reasoning with continuous latent
thought tokens, continuous CoT is able to perform implicit reasoning in a
compact manner. However, the sequential dependencies between latent thought
tokens spoil parallel training, leading to long training time. In this paper,
we propose Parallel Continuous Chain-of-Thought (PCCoT), which performs Jacobi
iteration on the latent thought tokens, updating them iteratively in parallel
instead of sequentially and thus improving both training and inference
efficiency of continuous CoT. Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the
proper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better
performance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time.
Moreover, PCCoT shows better stability and robustness in the training process.

TL;DR: The paper addresses data contamination concerns in LLM population simulations and argues that self-organization and emergent dynamics, such as social conventions, can still be studied despite these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address data contamination in LLM population simulations, which could affect experimental outcomes, but the authors believe it's possible to study emergent dynamics without being hindered by this concern.

Method: The method involves analyzing the critique by Barrie and T"ornberg [1] regarding Flint Ashery et al. [2]'s results and discussing how self-organisation and model-dependent emergent dynamics can be studied in LLM populations.

Result: The result is the clarification that data contamination does not prevent the study of emergent dynamics in LLM populations, with empirical evidence showing such dynamics in social conventions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that despite data contamination concerns, genuinely emergent dynamics in LLM populations, like social conventions, can be investigated and understood.

Abstract: A potential concern when simulating populations of large language models
(LLMs) is data contamination, i.e. the possibility that training data may shape
outcomes in unintended ways. While this concern is important and may hinder
certain experiments with multi-agent models, it does not preclude the study of
genuinely emergent dynamics in LLM populations. The recent critique by Barrie
and T\"ornberg [1] of the results of Flint Ashery et al. [2] offers an
opportunity to clarify that self-organisation and model-dependent emergent
dynamics can be studied in LLM populations, highlighting how such dynamics have
been empirically observed in the specific case of social conventions.

Abstract: Estimation of semantic similarity is an important research problem both in
natural language processing and the natural language understanding, and that
has tremendous application on various downstream tasks such as question
answering, semantic search, information retrieval, document clustering,
word-sense disambiguation and machine translation. In this work, we carry out
the estimation of semantic similarity using different state-of-the-art
techniques including the USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), InferSent and the
most recent BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers,
models. We use two question pairs datasets for the analysis, one is a domain
specific in-house dataset and the other is a public dataset which is the
Quora's question pairs dataset. We observe that the BERT model gave much
superior performance as compared to the other methods. This should be because
of the fine-tuning procedure that is involved in its training process, allowing
it to learn patterns based on the training data that is used. This works
demonstrates the applicability of BERT on domain specific datasets. We infer
from the analysis that BERT is the best technique to use in the case of domain
specific data.

### [295] [The Anatomy of Speech Persuasion: Linguistic Shifts in LLM-Modified Speeches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18621)
*Alisa Barkar,Mathieu Chollet,Matthieu Labeau,Beatrice Biancardi,Chloe Clavel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method to analyze how LLMs understand persuasiveness in speeches, using the 3MT French dataset. They found that GPT-4o makes systematic language changes, like using more emotions and questions, to boost persuasion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how large language models (LLMs) perceive and manipulate persuasiveness in public speaking, which is crucial for developing more effective and interpretable AI-driven speech analysis tools.

Method: The method involves modifying speech transcripts from the 3MT French dataset using a novel methodology and an interpretable textual feature set that includes rhetorical devices and discourse markers. They used GPT-4o to generate variations in persuasiveness and analyzed linguistic changes.

Result: The results show that GPT-4o applies systematic stylistic modifications rather than mimicking human-like persuasiveness strategies. It specifically uses emotional language and syntactic structures like questions and exclamations to increase rhetorical effect.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that while GPT-4o can alter text to enhance persuasiveness, it does so through structured linguistic changes rather than understanding it in a human way, highlighting the need for more human-like AI models in speech analysis.

Abstract: This study examines how large language models understand the concept of
persuasiveness in public speaking by modifying speech transcripts from PhD
candidates in the "Ma These en 180 Secondes" competition, using the 3MT French
dataset. Our contributions include a novel methodology and an interpretable
textual feature set integrating rhetorical devices and discourse markers. We
prompt GPT-4o to enhance or diminish persuasiveness and analyze linguistic
shifts between original and generated speech in terms of the new features.
Results indicate that GPT-4o applies systematic stylistic modifications rather
than optimizing persuasiveness in a human-like manner. Notably, it manipulates
emotional lexicon and syntactic structures (such as interrogative and
exclamatory clauses) to amplify rhetorical impact.

*Zébulon Goriely,Suchir Salhan,Pietro Lesci,Julius Cheng,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ByteSpan, an information-driven subword tokeniser that groups predictable bytes into subwords, showing better performance than BPE in English and comparable efficiency in 25 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve subword tokenisation by leveraging predictable byte sequences identified through an external byte-level language model, inspired by word segmentation models that use prediction error spikes.

Method: ByteSpan uses an external byte-level LM during training to find contiguous predictable byte sequences and group them into subwords, differing from traditional methods that pool latent representations into patches.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ByteSpan creates efficient vocabularies with higher morphological alignment scores than BPE for English, and similar compression and R\'enyi efficiency across 25 languages.

Conclusion: ByteSpan offers a novel approach to subword tokenisation by focusing on predictable byte sequences, achieving better performance in English and efficient results in multiple languages.

Abstract: Recent dynamic tokenisation methods operate directly on bytes and pool their
latent representations into patches. This bears similarities to computational
models of word segmentation that determine lexical boundaries using spikes in
an autoregressive model's prediction error. Inspired by this connection, we
explore whether grouping predictable bytes - rather than pooling their
representations - can yield a useful fixed subword vocabulary. We propose a new
information-driven subword tokeniser, ByteSpan, that uses an external
byte-level LM during training to identify contiguous predictable byte sequences
and group them into subwords. Experiments show that ByteSpan yields efficient
vocabularies with higher morphological alignment scores than BPE for English.
Multilingual experiments show similar compression and R\'enyi efficiency for 25
languages.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
increased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive
adoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is
the computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in
the efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the
number of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular
applications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation
is that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the
tokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most
likely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that
immediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing
tokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for
different tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot
conversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in
this domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers
consistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead
to meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or
even slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original
training corpus.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for
automatic speech recognition. When using appropriate modeling units, e.g.,
byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary
systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen
during training, e.g., named entities, acronyms, or domain-specific special
words. To address this problem, many context biasing methods have been
proposed; however, for words with a pronunciation-orthography mismatch, these
methods may still struggle. We propose a method which allows corrections of
substitution errors to improve the recognition accuracy of such challenging
words. Users can add corrections on the fly during inference. We show that with
this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to
11\%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate.

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a
pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving
a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and
practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel
dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain
Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND)
pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of
questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover
a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment
methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks.
We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to
89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship
between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value
frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at
https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow
interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such
as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance
in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to
influence education and help to address the global learning crisis.
Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to
understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and
support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed
for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and
LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and
policy decisions.

Motivation: Address unintended misinterpretations in LLMs due to diverse user requirements.

Method: Adaptive Greedy Binary Search simulates prompt optimization mechanisms with semantic stability.

Result: AGBS effectively balances semantic consistency and attack efficacy across LLMs.

Conclusion: Findings provide insights for designing reliable prompt optimization systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on automatic prompt
engineering in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to refine user inputs and
enhance response accuracy. However, the diversity of user requirements often
leads to unintended misinterpretations, where automated optimizations distort
original intentions and produce erroneous outputs. To address this challenge,
we propose the Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS) method, which simulates
common prompt optimization mechanisms while preserving semantic stability. Our
approach dynamically evaluates the impact of such strategies on LLM
performance, enabling robust adversarial sample generation. Through extensive
experiments on open and closed-source LLMs, we demonstrate AGBS's effectiveness
in balancing semantic consistency and attack efficacy. Our findings offer
actionable insights for designing more reliable prompt optimization systems.

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes, including
relevant legal charge, terms, and fines, which is a crucial process in Large
Language Model(LLM). However, LJP faces two key challenges: (1)Long Tail
Distribution: Current datasets, derived from authentic cases, suffer from high
human annotation costs and imbalanced distributions, leading to model
performance degradation. (2)Lawyer's Improvement: Existing systems focus on
enhancing judges' decision-making but neglect the critical role of lawyers in
refining arguments, which limits overall judicial accuracy. To address these
issues, we propose an Adversarial Self-Play Lawyer Augmented Legal Judgment
Framework, called ASP2LJ, which integrates a case generation module to tackle
long-tailed data distributions and an adversarial self-play mechanism to
enhance lawyers' argumentation skills. Our framework enables a judge to
reference evolved lawyers' arguments, improving the objectivity, fairness, and
rationality of judicial decisions. Besides, We also introduce RareCases, a
dataset for rare legal cases in China, which contains 120 tail-end cases. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the SimuCourt dataset and our
RareCases dataset. Experimental results show our framework brings improvements,
indicating its utilization. Our contributions include an integrated framework,
a rare-case dataset, and publicly releasing datasets and code to support
further research in automated judicial systems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the problem of self-consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs), showing that even small models and advanced ones like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are inconsistent in basic reasoning tasks. It introduces metrics and methods to address this, but the issue remains complex and important for reliable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure that LLMs' decisions are transparent and trustworthy by addressing their lack of self-consistency in internal reasoning, especially in simple tasks.

Method: The paper proposes two automated methods: a graph-based approach and an energy-based approach to quantify and mitigate inconsistencies in LLMs.

Result: The results show that even state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully self-consistent, and the proposed methods provide partial improvements in addressing these inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the complexity and importance of self-consistency in building more reliable and interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown increasingly powerful, yet ensuring
their decisions remain transparent and trustworthy requires self-consistency --
no contradictions in their internal reasoning. Our study reveals that even on
simple tasks, such as comparing points on a line or a plane, or reasoning in a
family tree, all smaller models are highly inconsistent, and even
state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully
self-consistent. To quantify and mitigate these inconsistencies, we introduce
inconsistency metrics and propose two automated methods -- a graph-based and an
energy-based approach. While these fixes provide partial improvements, they
also highlight the complexity and importance of self-consistency in building
more reliable and interpretable AI. The code and data are available at

scenario and three evaluations covering major types of errors observed in
summarization of medical research studies and was developed using Atropos
Health proprietary data. Additionally, we use RWESummary to compare the
performance of different LLMs in our internal RWE summarization tool. At the
time of publication, with 13 distinct RWE studies, we found the Gemini 2.5
models performed best overall (both Flash and Pro). We suggest RWESummary as a
novel and useful foundation model benchmark for real-world evidence study
summarization.

Abstract: This work describes the participation of the MLLP-VRAIN research group in the
shared task of the IWSLT 2025 Simultaneous Speech Translation track. Our
submission addresses the unique challenges of real-time translation of
long-form speech by developing a modular cascade system that adapts strong
pre-trained models to streaming scenarios. We combine Whisper Large-V3-Turbo
for ASR with the multilingual NLLB-3.3B model for MT, implementing lightweight
adaptation techniques rather than training new end-to-end models from scratch.
Our approach employs document-level adaptation with prefix training to enhance
the MT model's ability to handle incomplete inputs, while incorporating
adaptive emission policies including a wait-$k$ strategy and RALCP for managing
the translation stream. Specialized buffer management techniques and
segmentation strategies ensure coherent translations across long audio
sequences. Experimental results on the ACL60/60 dataset demonstrate that our
system achieves a favorable balance between translation quality and latency,
with a BLEU score of 31.96 and non-computational-aware StreamLAAL latency of
2.94 seconds. Our final model achieves a preliminary score on the official test
set (IWSLT25Instruct) of 29.8 BLEU. Our work demonstrates that carefully
adapted pre-trained components can create effective simultaneous translation
systems for long-form content without requiring extensive in-domain parallel
data or specialized end-to-end training.

TL;DR: This paper introduces STUPID, a dynamic method using a PID controller to reduce redundant reasoning in large language models, improving accuracy and reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The overthinking phenomenon in large language models with extended CoT reasoning causes excessive steps, increasing costs and possibly harming performance. Static steering methods aren't adaptive enough.

Method: STUPID uses a chunk-level classifier to detect redundancy and a PID controller to adjust steering strength in real-time during inference, without needing additional training.

Result: On GSM8K, STUPID improved accuracy by 6% and reduced token usage by 32%, surpassing static steering methods.

Conclusion: STUPID offers a structured approach to dynamically calibrate reasoning, maintaining quality while boosting efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models employing extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
often suffer from the overthinking phenomenon, generating excessive and
redundant reasoning steps that increase computational costs while potentially
degrading performance. While recent work has explored static steering
approaches to mitigate this issue, they lack the adaptability to dynamically
adjust intervention strength based on real-time reasoning quality. We propose
STUPID (Steering Token Usage via PID controller), a novel training-free method
that employs a PID controller to dynamically modulate activation steering
strength during inference. Our approach combines a chunk-level classifier for
detecting redundant reasoning patterns with a PID control mechanism that
adaptively adjusts steering intensity based on the predicted redundancy
probability. Experimental evaluation on GSM8K demonstrates that STUPID achieves
a 6% improvement in accuracy while reducing token usage by 32%, outperforming
static steering baselines. Our method provides a principled framework for
dynamic reasoning calibration that maintains reasoning quality while
significantly improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded
scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum
generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length
increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on
''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic
long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT
data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and
consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In
this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely
from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality
text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a
base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that
facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support
this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved
length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental
evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,
achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and
Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and
Qwen3-235B. We open-source our data and model checkpoints under

Motivation: As mechanistic interpretability (MI) becomes more influential, there's a growing need to critically examine the assumptions, concepts, and strategies within MI research, beyond just the models themselves.

Method: The paper presents a position argument, using three open problems from MI literature to illustrate how philosophy can contribute to MI research.

Result: Philosophy can add value to MI by clarifying concepts, refining methods, and assessing the epistemic and ethical stakes of interpreting AI systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating philosophy into MI research can foster deeper interdisciplinary dialogue and improve the field's understanding and ethical considerations.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to explain how neural networks work by
uncovering their underlying causal mechanisms. As the field grows in influence,
it is increasingly important to examine not just models themselves, but the

its methods, and assessing the epistemic and ethical stakes of interpreting AI
systems. Taking three open problems from the MI literature as examples, this

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring
long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory
bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative
Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for
long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a
lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded
via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during
decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position
Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention
mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and
low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context
benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%
with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache
quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with
minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context
length on a single RTX 4090 GPU. The source code is available at:

Abstract: Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought
reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on
Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set
of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking.
To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce
OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a
controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of
out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity:
(1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances
within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning
skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require
integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3)
Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond
familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of
programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem
generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and
puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical
methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance
degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the
Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable
improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization
remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By
isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the
groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond
mechanical proficiency.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs).
Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and
struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in
the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier
reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a
novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the
trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both
step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward
assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt
ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online
settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for
downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense
process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning,
and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results
on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond
demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs
(e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our
derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement
learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient
ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing global coastal datasets are too coarse (1-4 km), limiting their usefulness; the paper aims to provide higher precision using satellite imagery and computer vision.

Method: The paper develops a global coastline dataset at 10m resolution and introduces the Lighthouse library for efficient geospatial querying.

Result: The dataset offers 10m resolution, a 100+ fold improvement in precision over existing data, and Lighthouse achieves millisecond online inference with minimal resources.

Conclusion: Lighthouse is efficient and suitable for real-time applications in resource-limited settings, enhancing coastal distance calculations with higher precision.

Abstract: We introduce a new dataset and algorithm for fast and efficient coastal
distance calculations from Anywhere on Earth (AoE). Existing global coastal
datasets are only available at coarse resolution (e.g. 1-4 km) which limits
their utility. Publicly available satellite imagery combined with computer
vision enable much higher precision. We provide a global coastline dataset at
10 meter resolution, a 100+ fold improvement in precision over existing data.
To handle the computational challenge of querying at such an increased scale,
we introduce a new library: Layered Iterative Geospatial Hierarchical
Terrain-Oriented Unified Search Engine (Lighthouse). Lighthouse is both
exceptionally fast and resource-efficient, requiring only 1 CPU and 2 GB of RAM
to achieve millisecond online inference, making it well suited for real-time
applications in resource-constrained environments.

### [312] [Modal Logic for Stratified Becoming: Actualization Beyond Possible Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17276)
*Alexandre Le Nepvou*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Stratified Actualization Logic (SAL), a new modal logic framework that uses stratified actualization instead of traditional possible worlds semantics, focusing on ontological stability and structured layers of possibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional Kripke semantics, which treat modal operators as quantification over fully determinate alternatives, while neglecting the local, dynamic, and asymmetric nature of actualization processes.

Method: The method involves developing a new framework called Stratified Actualization Logic (SAL) where modalities are indexed by levels of ontological stability, interpreted as admissibility regimes. The paper formally defines the syntax and semantics of SAL, introduces its axioms, and proves soundness and completeness.

Result: The result is a logic that captures the ontological structure of actualization without using abstract possible worlds, providing a stratified alternative to standard modal realism.

Conclusion: SAL offers a novel approach to modal logic by focusing on stratified actualization, which better reflects the local, dynamic, and asymmetric nature of actualization processes, with applications in temporal becoming, quantum decoherence domains, and modal metaphysics.

Abstract: This article develops a novel framework for modal logic based on the idea of
stratified actualization, rather than the classical model of global possible
worlds. Traditional Kripke semantics treat modal operators as quantification
over fully determinate alternatives, neglecting the local, dynamic, and often
asymmetric nature of actualization processes. We propose a system Stratified
Actualization Logic (SAL) in which modalities are indexed by levels of
ontological stability, interpreted as admissibility regimes. Each modality
operates over a structured layer of possibility, grounded in the internal
coherence of transitions between layers. We formally define the syntax and
semantics of SAL, introduce its axioms, and prove soundness and completeness.
Applications are discussed in connection with temporal becoming, quantum
decoherence domains, and modal metaphysics. The result is a logic that captures
the ontological structure of actualization without recourse to abstract
possible worlds, offering a stratified alternative to standard modal realism.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Over the past decade, policymakers have developed a set of regulatory tools
to ensure AI development aligns with key societal goals. Many of these tools
were initially developed in response to concerns with predictive AI and
therefore encode certain assumptions about the nature of AI systems and the
utility of certain regulatory approaches. With the advent of generative AI,
however, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt
to maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI.
  In this paper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call
for meaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and
adaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the
difficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change
the ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed
structure of the generative AI value chain.
  In light of these distinctions, policymakers will need to evaluate where the
past decade of policy work remains relevant and where new policies, designed to
address the unique risks posed by generative AI, are necessary. We outline
three recommendations for policymakers to more effectively identify regulatory
targets and leverage constraints across the broader ecosystem to govern
generative AI.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate global information
access for millions of users worldwide, their alignment and biases have the
potential to shape public understanding and trust in fundamental democratic
institutions, such as press freedom. In this study, we uncover three systematic
distortions in the way six popular LLMs evaluate press freedom in 180 countries
compared to expert assessments of the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI). The six
LLMs exhibit a negative misalignment, consistently underestimating press
freedom, with individual models rating between 71% to 93% of countries as less
free. We also identify a paradoxical pattern we term differential misalignment:
LLMs disproportionately underestimate press freedom in countries where it is
strongest. Additionally, five of the six LLMs exhibit positive home bias,
rating their home countries' press freedoms more favorably than would be
expected given their negative misalignment with the human benchmark. In some
cases, LLMs rate their home countries between 7% to 260% more positively than
expected. If LLMs are set to become the next search engines and some of the
most important cultural tools of our time, they must ensure accurate
representations of the state of our human and civic rights globally.

Abstract: We explore the automatic generation of interactive, scenario-based lessons
designed to train novice human tutors who teach middle school mathematics
online. Employing prompt engineering through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
approach with GPT-4o, we developed a system capable of creating structured
tutor training lessons. Our study generated lessons in English for three key
topics: Encouraging Students' Independence, Encouraging Help-Seeking Behavior,
and Turning on Cameras, using a task decomposition prompting strategy that
breaks lesson generation into sub-tasks. The generated lessons were evaluated
by two human evaluators, who provided both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations using a comprehensive rubric informed by lesson design research.
Results demonstrate that the task decomposition strategy led to higher-rated
lessons compared to single-step generation. Human evaluators identified several
strengths in the LLM-generated lessons, including well-structured content and
time-saving potential, while also noting limitations such as generic feedback
and a lack of clarity in some instructional sections. These findings underscore
the potential of hybrid human-AI approaches for generating effective lessons in
tutor training.

Abstract: Virtual Teaching Assistants (VTAs) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)
have the potential to enhance student learning by providing instant feedback
and facilitating multi-turn interactions. However, empirical studies on their
effectiveness and acceptance in real-world classrooms are limited, leaving
their practical impact uncertain. In this study, we develop an LLM-based VTA
and deploy it in an introductory AI programming course with 477 graduate
students. To assess how student perceptions of the VTA's performance evolve
over time, we conduct three rounds of comprehensive surveys at different stages
of the course. Additionally, we analyze 3,869 student--VTA interaction pairs to
identify common question types and engagement patterns. We then compare these
interactions with traditional student--human instructor interactions to
evaluate the VTA's role in the learning process. Through a large-scale
empirical study and interaction analysis, we assess the feasibility of
deploying VTAs in real-world classrooms and identify key challenges for broader
adoption. Finally, we release the source code of our VTA system, fostering

Abstract: This work investigates the use of multimodal biometrics to detect
distractions caused by smartphone use during tasks that require sustained
attention, with a focus on computer-based online learning. Although the methods
are applicable to various domains, such as autonomous driving, we concentrate
on the challenges learners face in maintaining engagement amid internal (e.g.,
motivation), system-related (e.g., course design) and contextual (e.g.,
smartphone use) factors. Traditional learning platforms often lack detailed
behavioral data, but Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and biosensors
provide new insights into learner attention. We propose an AI-based approach
that leverages physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use.
Our results show that single biometric signals, such as brain waves or heart
rate, offer limited accuracy, while head pose alone achieves 87%. A multimodal
model combining all signals reaches 91% accuracy, highlighting the benefits of
integration. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of
deploying these models for real-time support in online learning environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As e-commerce rapidly integrates artificial intelligence for content creation
and product recommendations, these technologies offer significant benefits in
personalization and efficiency. AI-driven systems automate product
descriptions, generate dynamic advertisements, and deliver tailored
recommendations based on consumer behavior, as seen in major platforms like
Amazon and Shopify. However, the widespread use of AI in e-commerce raises
crucial ethical challenges, particularly around data privacy, algorithmic bias,
and consumer autonomy. Bias -- whether cultural, gender-based, or socioeconomic
-- can be inadvertently embedded in AI models, leading to inequitable product
recommendations and reinforcing harmful stereotypes. This paper examines the
ethical implications of AI-driven content creation and product recommendations,
emphasizing the need for frameworks to ensure fairness, transparency, and need
for more established and robust ethical standards. We propose actionable best
practices to remove bias and ensure inclusivity, such as conducting regular
audits of algorithms, diversifying training data, and incorporating fairness
metrics into AI models. Additionally, we discuss frameworks for ethical
conformance that focus on safeguarding consumer data privacy, promoting
transparency in decision-making processes, and enhancing consumer autonomy. By
addressing these issues, we provide guidelines for responsibly utilizing AI in
e-commerce applications for content creation and product recommendations,
ensuring that these technologies are both effective and ethically sound.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Due to the presence of political echo chambers, it becomes imperative to
detect and remove subjective bias and emotionally charged language from both
the text and images of political articles. However, prior work has focused on
solely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image
portions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium
to communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that
leverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.
Image Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their
bias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias
score of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting
biased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three
steps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and
the image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by
comparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is
promising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many
potential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective
training. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time,
particularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results. A
human evaluation portion was also proposed to ensure semantic consistency of
the newly generated text and images.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Mastery learning improves learning proficiency and efficiency. However, the
overpractice of skills--students spending time on skills they have already
mastered--remains a fundamental challenge for tutoring systems. Previous
research has reduced overpractice through the development of better problem
selection algorithms and the authoring of focused practice tasks. However, few
efforts have concentrated on reducing overpractice through step-level
adaptivity, which can avoid resource-intensive curriculum redesign. We propose
and evaluate Fast-Forwarding as a technique that enhances existing problem
selection algorithms. Based on simulation studies informed by learner models
and problem-solving pathways derived from real student data, Fast-Forwarding
can reduce overpractice by up to one-third, as it does not require students to
complete problem-solving steps if all remaining pathways are fully mastered.
Fast-Forwarding is a flexible method that enhances any problem selection
algorithm, though its effectiveness is highest for algorithms that
preferentially select difficult problems. Therefore, our findings suggest that
while Fast-Forwarding may improve student practice efficiency, the size of its
practical impact may also depend on students' ability to stay motivated and
engaged at higher levels of difficulty.

TL;DR: MAARTA is a multi-agent framework that provides personalized feedback to radiology students by analyzing gaze patterns and reports, helping them improve diagnostic reasoning by identifying and explaining perceptual errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology students need better support in developing perceptual expertise, which is currently lacking due to limited expert mentorship. Existing AI systems focus on diagnostic accuracy but don't explain errors.

Method: MAARTA uses gaze pattern analysis and structured graphs to compare expert and student behavior, dynamically selecting agents based on error complexity and employing step-by-step prompting for feedback.

Result: MAARTA can identify missed findings and provide explanations for perceptual errors, improving students' diagnostic reasoning through personalized feedback.

Conclusion: MAARTA advances AI-driven radiology education by addressing perceptual errors through adaptive multi-agent analysis and structured feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Radiology students often struggle to develop perceptual expertise due to
limited expert mentorship time, leading to errors in visual search and
diagnostic interpretation. These perceptual errors, such as missed fixations,
short dwell times, or misinterpretations, are not adequately addressed by
current AI systems, which focus on diagnostic accuracy but fail to explain how
and why errors occur. To address this gap, we introduce MAARTA (Multi-Agentic
Adaptive Radiology Teaching Assistant), a multi-agent framework that analyzes
gaze patterns and radiology reports to provide personalized feedback. Unlike
single-agent models, MAARTA dynamically selects agents based on error
complexity, enabling adaptive and efficient reasoning. By comparing expert and
student gaze behavior through structured graphs, the system identifies missed
findings and assigns Perceptual Error Teacher agents to analyze discrepancies.
MAARTA then uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand their
errors and improve diagnostic reasoning, advancing AI-driven radiology
education.

fundamental topics such as regression, interpolation, numerical integration,
distributional discrepancies, and statistical dependence, as well as for sample
path properties of Gaussian processes. A unifying perspective for these
equivalences is established, based on the equivalence between the Gaussian
Hilbert space and the RKHS. The monograph serves as a basis to bridge many
other methods based on Gaussian processes and reproducing kernels, which are
developed in parallel by the two research communities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric regression method that models complex
input-output relationships as the sum of convex and concave components. The
method-Identifiable Convex-Concave Nonparametric Least Squares
(ICCNLS)-decomposes the target function into additive shape-constrained
components, each represented via sub-gradient-constrained affine functions. To
address the affine ambiguity inherent in convex-concave decompositions, we
introduce global statistical orthogonality constraints, ensuring that residuals
are uncorrelated with both intercept and input variables. This enforces
decomposition identifiability and improves interpretability. We further
incorporate L1, L2 and elastic net regularisation on sub-gradients to enhance
generalisation and promote structural sparsity. The proposed method is
evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, including healthcare pricing
data, and demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and model simplicity
compared to conventional CNLS and difference-of-convex (DC) regression
approaches. Our results show that statistical identifiability, when paired with
convex-concave structure and sub-gradient regularisation, yields interpretable
models suited for forecasting, benchmarking, and policy evaluation.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized machine learning (ML) by enabling
efficient modeling of global dependencies across inputs. Their inherently
parallelizable structures allow for efficient scaling with the exponentially
increasing size of both pretrained data and model parameters. Yet, despite
their central role as the computational backbone of modern large language
models (LLMs), the theoretical understanding of Attentions, especially in the
nonlinear setting, remains limited.
  In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of the \emph{in-context
memorization error} of \emph{nonlinear Attention}, in the high-dimensional
proportional regime where the number of input tokens $n$ and their embedding
dimension $p$ are both large and comparable. Leveraging recent advances in the
theory of large kernel random matrices, we show that nonlinear Attention
typically incurs higher memorization error than linear ridge regression on
random inputs. However, this gap vanishes, and can even be reversed, when the
input exhibits statistical structure, particularly when the Attention weights
align with the input signal direction. Our results reveal how nonlinearity and
input structure interact with each other to govern the memorization performance
of nonlinear Attention. The theoretical insights are supported by numerical
experiments.

improvement in robustness against corrupted data and adversarial attacks
simultaneously. To address this challenge, we introduce DRO-Augment, a novel
framework that integrates Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization
(W-DRO) with various data augmentation strategies to improve the robustness of
the models significantly across a broad spectrum of corruptions. Our method
outperforms existing augmentation methods under severe data perturbations and
adversarial attack scenarios while maintaining the accuracy on the clean
datasets on a range of benchmark datasets, including but not limited to
CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST. On the theoretical side, we
establish novel generalization error bounds for neural networks trained using a
computationally efficient, variation-regularized loss function closely related
to the W-DRO problem.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Knowledge erasure in large language models (LLMs) is important for ensuring
compliance with data and AI regulations, safeguarding user privacy, mitigating
bias, and misinformation. Existing unlearning methods aim to make the process
of knowledge erasure more efficient and effective by removing specific
knowledge while preserving overall model performance, especially for retained
information. However, it has been observed that the unlearning techniques tend
to suppress and leave the knowledge beneath the surface, thus making it
retrievable with the right prompts. In this work, we demonstrate that
\textit{step-by-step reasoning} can serve as a backdoor to recover this hidden
information. We introduce a step-by-step reasoning-based black-box attack,
Sleek, that systematically exposes unlearning failures. We employ a structured
attack framework with three core components: (1) an adversarial prompt
generation strategy leveraging step-by-step reasoning built from LLM-generated
queries, (2) an attack mechanism that successfully recalls erased content, and
exposes unfair suppression of knowledge intended for retention and (3) a
categorization of prompts as direct, indirect, and implied, to identify which
query types most effectively exploit unlearning weaknesses. Through extensive
evaluations on four state-of-the-art unlearning techniques and two widely used
LLMs, we show that existing approaches fail to ensure reliable knowledge
removal. Of the generated adversarial prompts, 62.5% successfully retrieved
forgotten Harry Potter facts from WHP-unlearned Llama, while 50% exposed unfair
suppression of retained knowledge. Our work highlights the persistent risks of
information leakage, emphasizing the need for more robust unlearning strategies
for erasure.

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative learning among clients via a
coordinating server while avoiding direct data sharing, offering a perceived
solution to preserve privacy. However, recent studies on Membership Inference
Attacks (MIAs) have challenged this notion, showing high success rates against
unprotected training data. While local differential privacy (LDP) is widely
regarded as a gold standard for privacy protection in data analysis, most
studies on MIAs either neglect LDP or fail to provide theoretical guarantees
for attack success rates against LDP-protected data. To address this gap, we
derive theoretical lower bounds for the success rates of low-polynomial time
MIAs that exploit vulnerabilities in fully connected or self-attention layers.
We establish that even when data are protected by LDP, privacy risks persist,
depending on the privacy budget. Practical evaluations on federated vision
models confirm considerable privacy risks, revealing that the noise required to
mitigate these attacks significantly degrades models' utility.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed in
safety-critical applications, the lack of systematic methods to assess their
vulnerability to jailbreak attacks presents a critical security gap. We
introduce the jailbreak oracle problem: given a model, prompt, and decoding
strategy, determine whether a jailbreak response can be generated with
likelihood exceeding a specified threshold. This formalization enables a
principled study of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Answering the jailbreak oracle
problem poses significant computational challenges -- the search space grows
exponentially with the length of the response tokens. We present Boa, the first
efficient algorithm for solving the jailbreak oracle problem. Boa employs a
three-phase search strategy: (1) constructing block lists to identify refusal
patterns, (2) breadth-first sampling to identify easily accessible jailbreaks,
and (3) depth-first priority search guided by fine-grained safety scores to
systematically explore promising low-probability paths. Boa enables rigorous
security assessments including systematic defense evaluation, standardized
comparison of red team attacks, and model certification under extreme
adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autonomous web navigation agents, which translate natural language
instructions into sequences of browser actions, are increasingly deployed for
complex tasks across e-commerce, information retrieval, and content discovery.
Due to the stateless nature of large language models (LLMs), these agents rely
heavily on external memory systems to maintain context across interactions.
Unlike centralized systems where context is securely stored server-side, agent
memory is often managed client-side or by third-party applications, creating
significant security vulnerabilities. This was recently exploited to attack
production systems.
  We introduce and formalize "plan injection," a novel context manipulation
attack that corrupts these agents' internal task representations by targeting
this vulnerable context. Through systematic evaluation of two popular web
agents, Browser-use and Agent-E, we show that plan injections bypass robust
prompt injection defenses, achieving up to 3x higher attack success rates than
comparable prompt-based attacks. Furthermore, "context-chained injections,"
which craft logical bridges between legitimate user goals and attacker
objectives, lead to a 17.7% increase in success rate for privacy exfiltration
tasks. Our findings highlight that secure memory handling must be a first-class
concern in agentic systems.

Method: The method involves applying XAI to a Healthcare 5.0 dataset combining network traffic and biomedical sensor data.

Result: XGBoost achieved 99% F1-score for benign and data alteration, and 81% for spoofing, with network data being dominant in intrusion detection and biomedical features contributing to spoofing detection, especially temperature with a Shapley value of 0.37.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that integrating XAI into Healthcare 5.0 enhances cybersecurity by providing interpretable models, with network data and specific biomedical features like temperature being critical for different types of threats.

Abstract: Healthcare 5.0 integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of

this gap by applying eXplainable AI (XAI) to a Healthcare 5.0 dataset that
integrates network traffic and biomedical sensor data. Classification outputs
indicate that XGBoost achieved 99% F1-score for benign and data alteration, and

Abstract: Backdoor attacks have emerged as a critical security threat against deep
neural networks in recent years. The majority of existing backdoor attacks
focus on targeted backdoor attacks, where trigger is strongly associated to
specific malicious behavior. Various backdoor detection methods depend on this
inherent property and shows effective results in identifying and mitigating
such targeted attacks. However, a purely untargeted attack in backdoor
scenarios is, in some sense, self-weakening, since the target nature is what
makes backdoor attacks so powerful. In light of this, we introduce a novel
Constrained Untargeted Backdoor Attack (CUBA), which combines the flexibility
of untargeted attacks with the intentionality of targeted attacks. The
compromised model, when presented with backdoor images, will classify them into
random classes within a constrained range of target classes selected by the
attacker. This combination of randomness and determinedness enables the
proposed untargeted backdoor attack to natively circumvent existing backdoor
defense methods. To implement the untargeted backdoor attack under controlled
flexibility, we propose to apply logit normalization on cross-entropy loss with
flipped one-hot labels. By constraining the logit during training, the
compromised model will show a uniform distribution across selected target
classes, resulting in controlled untargeted attack. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CUBA on different datasets.

Abstract: The increasing demand for domain-specific and human-aligned Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread adoption of Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) techniques. SFT datasets often comprise valuable instruction-response
pairs, making them highly valuable targets for potential extraction. This paper
studies this critical research problem for the first time. We start by formally
defining and formulating the problem, then explore various attack goals, types,
and variants based on the unique properties of SFT data in real-world
scenarios. Based on our analysis of extraction behaviors of direct extraction,
we develop a novel extraction method specifically designed for SFT models,
called Differentiated Data Extraction (DDE), which exploits the confidence
levels of fine-tuned models and their behavioral differences from pre-trained
base models. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains and
scenarios, we demonstrate the feasibility of SFT data extraction using DDE. Our
results show that DDE consistently outperforms existing extraction baselines in
all attack settings. To counter this new attack, we propose a defense mechanism
that mitigates DDE attacks with minimal impact on model performance. Overall,
our research reveals hidden data leak risks in fine-tuned LLMs and provides
insights for developing more secure models.

Abstract: Verifiers can improve language model capabilities by scoring and ranking
responses from generated candidates. Currently, high-quality verifiers are
either unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean).
While LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose
verifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle
verifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we
introduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining
multiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers,
which typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform
unweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce
dependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each
verifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better
reflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision
algorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and
handling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics
to normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers. We study Weaver's
effectiveness in test-time repeated sampling, where a model generates multiple
candidate responses and selects one. Our evaluations show Weaver significantly
improves over Pass@1-performance when selecting the first candidate-across
reasoning and math tasks, achieving o3-mini-level accuracy with Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct as generator, and an ensemble of 70B or smaller judge and reward
models as verifiers (87.7% average). This gain mirrors the jump between GPT-4o
and o3-mini (69.0% vs. 86.7%), which required extensive finetuning and
post-training. To reduce computational costs of verifier ensembles, we train a
400M cross-encoder using Weaver's combined output scores.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Architectural obfuscation - e.g., permuting hidden-state tensors, linearly
transforming embedding tables, or remapping tokens - has recently gained
traction as a lightweight substitute for heavyweight cryptography in
privacy-preserving large-language-model (LLM) inference. While recent work has
shown that these techniques can be broken under dedicated reconstruction
attacks, their impact on mechanistic interpretability has not been
systematically studied. In particular, it remains unclear whether scrambling a
network's internal representations truly thwarts efforts to understand how the
model works, or simply relocates the same circuits to an unfamiliar coordinate
system. We address this gap by analyzing a GPT-2-small model trained from
scratch with a representative obfuscation map. Assuming the obfuscation map is
private and the original basis is hidden (mirroring an honest-but-curious
server), we apply logit-lens attribution, causal path-patching, and
attention-head ablation to locate and manipulate known circuits. Our findings
reveal that obfuscation dramatically alters activation patterns within
attention heads yet preserves the layer-wise computational graph. This
disconnect hampers reverse-engineering of user prompts: causal traces lose
their alignment with baseline semantics, and token-level logit attributions
become too noisy to reconstruct. At the same time, feed-forward and residual
pathways remain functionally intact, suggesting that obfuscation degrades
fine-grained interpretability without compromising top-level task performance.
These results establish quantitative evidence that architectural obfuscation
can simultaneously (i) retain global model behaviour and (ii) impede
mechanistic analyses of user-specific content. By mapping where
interpretability breaks down, our study provides guidance for future privacy
defences and for robustness-aware interpretability tooling.

Abstract: With the widespread application of edge computing and cloud systems in

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerability detection remains a major challenge in
blockchain security. Existing vulnerability detection methods face two main
issues: (1) Existing datasets lack comprehensive coverage and high-quality
explanations for preference learning. (2) Large language models (LLMs) often
struggle with accurately interpreting specific concepts in smart contract
security. Empirical analysis shows that even after continual pre-training (CPT)
and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LLMs may misinterpret the execution order of
state changes, resulting in incorrect explanations despite making correct
detection decisions. To address these challenges, we propose Smart-LLaMA-DPO
based on LLaMA-3.1-8B. We construct a comprehensive dataset covering four major
vulnerability types and machine-unauditable vulnerabilities, including precise
labels, explanations, and locations for SFT, as well as high-quality and
low-quality output pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Second, we
perform CPT using large-scale smart contract to enhance the LLM's understanding
of specific security practices in smart contracts. Futhermore, we conduct SFT
with our comprehensive dataset. Finally, we apply DPO, leveraging human
feedback and a specially designed loss function that increases the probability
of preferred explanations while reducing the likelihood of non-preferred
outputs. We evaluate Smart-LLaMA-DPO on four major vulnerability types:
reentrancy, timestamp dependence, integer overflow/underflow, and delegatecall,
as well as machine-unauditable vulnerabilities. Our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with average improvements of 10.43% in
F1 score and 7.87% in accuracy. Moreover, both LLM evaluation and human
evaluation confirm that our method generates more correct, thorough, and clear
explanations.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical
concerns over their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, i.e., adversarial
prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms and elicit harmful or policy-violating
outputs. While proprietary models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive
evaluation, the robustness of emerging open-source alternatives such as
DeepSeek remains largely underexplored, despite their growing adoption in
real-world applications. In this paper, we present the first systematic
jailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack
strategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and
semantic domain. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture introduces routing sparsity that offers selective robustness
against optimization-based attacks such as TAP-T, but leads to significantly
higher vulnerability under prompt-based and manually engineered attacks. In
contrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety
alignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design
and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral
analysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial
prompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal
behaviors. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between
architectural efficiency and alignment generalization, emphasizing the need for
targeted safety tuning and modular alignment strategies to ensure secure
deployment of open-source LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents KnoVo (Knowledge Evolution), an intelligent framework
designed for quantifying and analyzing the evolution of research novelty in the
scientific literature. Moving beyond traditional citation analysis, which
primarily measures impact, KnoVo determines a paper's novelty relative to both
prior and subsequent work within its multilayered citation network. Given a
target paper's abstract, KnoVo utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically extract dimensions of comparison (e.g., methodology, application,
dataset). The target paper is then compared to related publications along these
same extracted dimensions. This comparative analysis, inspired by tournament
selection, yields quantitative novelty scores reflecting the relative
improvement, equivalence, or inferiority of the target paper in specific
aspects. By aggregating these scores and visualizing their progression, for
instance, through dynamic evolution graphs and comparative radar charts, KnoVo
facilitates researchers not only to assess originality and identify similar
work, but also to track knowledge evolution along specific research dimensions,
uncover research gaps, and explore cross-disciplinary connections. We
demonstrate these capabilities through a detailed analysis of 20 diverse papers
from multiple scientific fields and report on the performance of various
open-source LLMs within the KnoVo framework.

Abstract: We developed a proof-of-concept method for the automatic analysis of the

annotated pages from five different incunabula was created using resources from
the Jagiellonian Digital Library. Each page was manually labeled with five
predefined classes: Text, Title, Picture, Table, and Handwriting. Additionally,
the publicly available DocLayNet dataset was utilized as supplementary training
data. To perform object detection, YOLO11n and YOLO11s models were employed and
trained using two strategies: a combined dataset (DocLayNet and the custom
dataset) and the custom dataset alone. The highest performance (F1 = 0.94) was
achieved by the YOLO11n model trained exclusively on the custom data. Optical
character recognition was then conducted on regions classified as Text, using
both Tesseract and Kraken OCR, with Tesseract demonstrating superior results.
Subsequently, image classification was applied to the Picture class using a
ResNet18 model, achieving an accuracy of 98.7% across five subclasses:
Decorative_letter, Illustration, Other, Stamp, and Wrong_detection.
Furthermore, the CLIP model was utilized to generate semantic descriptions of
illustrations. The results confirm the potential of machine learning in the
analysis of early printed books, while emphasizing the need for further
advancements in OCR performance and visual content interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy and predictability of model updating in structural health monitoring by addressing the limitations of current methods that only handle low-dimensional models (up to 20 parameters).

Method: The paper conducts an analytical investigation to understand the curse of dimensionality in Bayesian model updating, focusing on the distance between prior and posterior distributions, as well as factors like multi-modality and degeneracy.

Result: The analytical investigation provides insights into where the posterior mass is located and its comparison to the prior volume, highlighting the difficulty of parameter estimation in high-dimensional problems.

Conclusion: The study concludes that both dimensionality and other factors affecting the prior-posterior distance are critical in Bayesian model updating, and strategies are proposed to overcome these challenges.

Abstract: Bayesian approach provides a coherent framework to address the model updating
problem in structural health monitoring. The current practice, however, only
focuses on low-dimension model (generally no more than 20 parameters), which
limits the accuracy and predictability of the updated model. This paper aims at
understanding the curse of dimensionality in Bayesian model updating, and thus
proposing feasible strategies to overcome it. An analytical investigation is
conducted, which allows us to answer fundamental questions in Bayesian
analysis, e.g., where the posterior mass locates and how large of it comparing
to the prior volume. The key concept here is the distance from the prior to the
posterior, which makes the parameter estimation really difficult in
high-dimension problems. In this sense, not only the dimensionality matters,
but also the multi-modality, the pronounced degeneracy, and other factors that
influence the prior-posterior distance matter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of attention on causal inference among discrete random variables, specifically in Poisson graphical models, as most existing studies focus on continuous variables.

Method: The method involves using likelihood ratio tests under non-convex acyclicity constraints to infer directed graph structures, deriving asymptotic distributions under high-dimensional settings.

Result: The results demonstrate that the proposed tests effectively infer directed linkages and pathways, with simulations confirming their power and an NBA dataset analysis illustrating their practical utility.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the method provides a viable approach for causal inference in Poisson graphical models, offering valuable insights into complex networks like NBA player statistics.

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs are widely used to describe the causal effects among
random variables, and the inference of those causal effects has become an
popular topic in statistics and machine learning, and has wide applications in
neuroinformatics, bioinformatics and so on. However, most studies focus on the
estimation or inference of the directional relations among continuous random
variables, those among discrete random variables have not gained much
attentions. In this article we focus on the inference of directed linkages and
directed pathways in a Poisson directed graphical model. We employ likelihood
ratio tests subject to non-convex acyclicity constraints, and derive the
asymptotic distributions of the test statistic under the null hypothesis is
true in high-dimensional situations. The power analysis and simulations suggest
that the tests achieve the desired objectives of inference. An analysis of a
basketball statistics dataset of NBA players during 2016-2017 season
illustrates the utility of the proposed method to infer directed linkages and
directed pathways in player's statistics network.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Radiation therapy outcomes are decided by two key parameters, dose and
timing, whose best values vary substantially across patients. This variability
is especially critical in the treatment of brain cancer, where fractionated or
staged stereotactic radiosurgery improves safety compared to single fraction
approaches, but complicates the ability to predict treatment response. To
address this challenge, we employ Personalized Ultra-fractionated Stereotactic
Adaptive Radiotherapy (PULSAR), a strategy that dynamically adjusts treatment
based on how each tumor evolves over time. However, the success of PULSAR and
other adaptive approaches depends on predictive tools that can guide early
treatment decisions and avoid both overtreatment and undertreatment. However,
current radiomics and dosiomics models offer limited insight into the evolving
spatial and temporal patterns of tumor response. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM),
which learns data-driven mappings from pre to post treatment imaging. In this
study, we developed single step and iterative denoising strategies and compared
their performance. The results show that diffusion models can effectively
simulate patient specific tumor evolution and localize regions associated with
treatment response. The proposed strategy provides a promising foundation for
modeling heterogeneous treatment response and enabling early, adaptive
interventions, paving the way toward more personalized and biologically
informed radiotherapy.

Abstract: Personalized precision radiation therapy requires more than simple
classification, it demands the identification of prognostic, spatially

response. This study compares three approaches for predicting treatment
response: standard radiomics, gradient based features, and convolutional neural
networks enhanced with Class Activation Mapping. We analyzed 69 brain
metastases from 39 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. An
integrated autoencoder classifier model was used to predict whether tumor
volume would shrink by more than 20 percent at a three months follow up, framed
as a binary classification task. The results highlight their strength in
hierarchical feature extraction and the classifiers discriminative capacity.
Among the models, pixel wise CAM provides the most detailed spatial insight,
identifying lesion specific regions rather than relying on fixed patterns,
demonstrating strong generalization. In non responding lesions, the activated
regions may indicate areas of radio resistance. Pixel wise CAM outperformed
both radiomics and gradient based methods in classification accuracy. Moreover,
its fine grained spatial features allow for alignment with cellular level data,
supporting biological validation and deeper understanding of heterogeneous
treatment responses. Although further validation is necessary, these findings
underscore the promise in guiding personalized and adaptive radiotherapy
strategies for both photon and particle therapies.

Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still exhibit

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), code benchmarks have become an
important research area in software engineering and are widely used by
practitioners. These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific
code-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step
in constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing
code benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are
prone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could
result in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations
of model capabilities.
  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental
designs and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt
sensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that
modifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and
their structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct
extensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative
open-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt
templates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical
metrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings
suggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in
performance. Additionally, we observe that such variations can introduce
inconsistencies in the performance rankings across different models. These
insights highlight the need for considering prompt sensitivity when designing
future code benchmarks, to ensure more reliable and accurate evaluation of LLM
capabilities.

Result: It identifies the need for a research agenda and call to action to address central issues in AI-assisted generative software reuse.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by advocating for a proactive research agenda to tackle the challenges and implications of AI-assisted generative software reuse in the context of AI native software engineering.

Abstract: Software development is currently under a paradigm shift in which artificial
intelligence and generative software reuse are taking the center stage in
software creation. Consequently, earlier software reuse practices and methods
are rapidly being replaced by AI-assisted approaches in which developers place
their trust on code that has been generated by artificial intelligence. This is
leading to a new form of software reuse that is conceptually not all that
different from cargo cult development. In this paper we discuss the
implications of AI-assisted generative software reuse in the context of
emerging "AI native" software engineering, bring forth relevant questions, and
define a tentative research agenda and call to action for tackling some of the
central issues associated with this approach.

Abstract: Static analysis plays a key role in finding bugs, including security issues.
A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model
function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features,
existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound
nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges
and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed
call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full
program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our
approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model
non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose
representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and
semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static
call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the
same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine
learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by
ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a
large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges
(150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M
structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top
candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases,
reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that
learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph
construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link
prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the need to prioritize energy efficiency in AI development, proposing a strategic approach across five pipeline phases to significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing computational demands and energy challenges in AI, emphasizing the need for energy efficiency as a primary design consideration rather than an afterthought.

Method: The method involves analyzing the AI pipeline across five phases (data, model, training, system, inference) and exploring orthogonal combinations of optimization techniques to achieve cascading efficiency gains.

Result: The results show that the proposed approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 94.6% while preserving 95.95% of the original F1 score from non-optimized pipelines.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a curated, strategic selection of optimizations across AI pipeline phases provides a sustainable framework that balances efficiency, performance, and environmental responsibility.

Abstract: AI's exponential growth intensifies computational demands and energy
challenges. While practitioners employ various optimization techniques, that we
refer as "knobs" in this paper, to tune model efficiency, these are typically
afterthoughts and reactive ad-hoc changes applied in isolation without
understanding their combinatorial effects on energy efficiency. This paper
emphasizes on treating energy efficiency as the first-class citizen and as a
fundamental design consideration for a compute-intensive pipeline. We show that
strategic selection across five AI pipeline phases (data, model, training,
system, inference) creates cascading efficiency. Experimental validation shows
orthogonal combinations reduce energy consumption by up to $94.6$% while
preserving $95.95$% of the original F1 score of non-optimized pipelines. This
curated approach provides actionable frameworks for informed sustainable AI
that balance efficiency, performance, and environmental responsibility.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but ensuring their
outputs to be functionally correct, especially in complex programming tasks, is
a persistent challenge. While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers
a path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the
scarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test
generation, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can
misdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated
Solver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to
validate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on
specific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define
and verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the
"cycle of self-deception" where tests might share flaws with the code they are
meant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative
LLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative
refinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate
semantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting
comprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its
refinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within
this iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a
robust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code.
Extensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks
demonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1
improvements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD
methods.

<details>

Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of AI debugging losing effectiveness quickly, which is a critical problem for practical code generation systems.

Method: The method involves introducing the Debugging Decay Index (DDI) as a mathematical framework to quantify and predict the point where debugging becomes ineffective, along with a strategic fresh start approach that shifts from exploitation to exploration at key moments.

Result: The result shows that most models lose 60-80% of debugging capability within 2-3 attempts, and that strategic interventions can effectively restore debugging performance.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that DDI identifies a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and offers a quantitative framework to optimize iterative code generation strategies, emphasizing the importance of well-timed interventions.

Abstract: The effectiveness of AI debugging follows a predictable exponential decay
pattern; most models lose 60-80% of their debugging capability within just 2-3
attempts, despite iterative debugging being a critical capability for practical
code generation systems. We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a
mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and
predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from
exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process,
demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of
debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and
provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code
generation strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to automate
complex software engineering tasks such as program repair and issue resolution.
These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts,
invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite
their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these
agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their
operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale
empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three
state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: \textsc{RepairAgent},
\textsc{AutoCodeRover}, and \textsc{OpenHands}. We unify their interaction logs
into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2822 LLM interactions
focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative
analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with
qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We
identify key trajectory characteristics such as iteration counts and token
consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence linking
thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and
anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing
actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies,
failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and
annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust
autonomous software engineering agents.

TL;DR: This paper resolves the controversy over Ti-V alloy's BCC miscibility gap by using ab initio + machine learning, showing the gap exists without oxygen impurities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve conflicting experimental results about the Ti-V binary alloy's phase behavior, specifically whether it has a BCC miscibility gap or is completely soluble.

Method: Ab initio calculations combined with machine learning through an actively-trained Moment Tensor Potential, integrated with Bayesian thermodynamic inference.

Result: A thermodynamic phase diagram for the Ti-V system covering the full composition range with confidence intervals, reproducing all experimental features and confirming the BCC miscibility gap.

Conclusion: The BCC miscibility gap in Ti-V alloys exists without oxygen contamination, refuting recent CALPHAD reassessments that suggested impurity effects.

Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V)
binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains
completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to
oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this controversy, we
use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained
Moment Tensor Potential to Bayesian thermodynamic inference. Using this
workflow, we obtain Ti-V binary system across the entire composition range,
together with confidence intervals in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting
diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of
our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap
terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because oxygen was excluded from
simulations, the gap cannot be attributed to impurity effects, contradicting
recent CALPHAD reassessments.

Abstract: The growth of lithium dendrites significantly impacts the performance and
safety of rechargeable batteries, leading to short circuits and capacity
degradation. This study proposes a Residual Connection-Enhanced ConvLSTM model
to predict dendrite growth patterns with improved accuracy and computational
efficiency. By integrating residual connections into ConvLSTM, the model
mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, enhances feature retention across
layers, and effectively captures both localized dendrite growth dynamics and
macroscopic battery behavior. The dataset was generated using a phase-field
model, simulating dendrite evolution under varying conditions. Experimental
results show that the proposed model achieves up to 7% higher accuracy and
significantly reduces mean squared error (MSE) compared to conventional
ConvLSTM across different voltage conditions (0.1V, 0.3V, 0.5V). This
highlights the effectiveness of residual connections in deep spatiotemporal
networks for electrochemical system modeling. The proposed approach offers a
robust tool for battery diagnostics, potentially aiding in real-time monitoring
and optimization of lithium battery performance. Future research can extend
this framework to other battery chemistries and integrate it with real-world
experimental data for further validation

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) leverage large-scale pretraining for
diverse imaging tasks but require substantial computational and data resources.
Meanwhile, common or general-purpose VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA), though not
trained for medical use, show promise with fine-tuning. This raises a key
question: Can efficient fine-tuned common VLMs rival generalist medical VLMs
for solving specific medical imaging tasks? This study systematically evaluates
common and medical VLMs across disease diagnosis and visual question answering
(VQA). Using CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models, we examine (1) off-the-shelf
performance gaps in in-domain (ID) settings, (2) whether fine-tuning bridges
these gaps, and (3) generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks on unseen
medical modalities. While medical-specific pretraining provides advantages in
ID settings, common VLMs match or surpass medical-specific models after
lightweight fine-tuning, with LoRA-based adaptation proving highly effective
among different tasks. In OOD tasks, common VLMs demonstrate strong
adaptability in some tasks, challenging the assumption that medical-specific
pre-training is essential. These findings suggest that leveraging common VLMs
with fine-tuning offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to developing
large-scale medical VLMs, providing crucial insights for future research in the
medical imaging field.

Abstract: Following successful large-vessel recanalization via endovascular
thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), some patients experience a
complication known as no-reflow, defined by persistent microvascular
hypoperfusion that undermines tissue recovery and worsens clinical outcomes.
Although prompt identification is crucial, standard clinical practice relies on
perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24 hours post-procedure,
delaying intervention. In this work, we introduce the first-ever machine
learning (ML) framework to predict no-reflow immediately after EVT by
leveraging previously unexplored intra-procedural digital subtraction
angiography (DSA) sequences and clinical variables. Our retrospective analysis
included AIS patients treated at UCLA Medical Center (2011-2024) who achieved
favorable mTICI scores (2b-3) and underwent pre- and post-procedure MRI.
No-reflow was defined as persistent hypoperfusion (Tmax > 6 s) on
post-procedural imaging. From DSA sequences (AP and lateral views), we
extracted statistical and temporal perfusion features from the target
downstream territory to train ML classifiers for predicting no-reflow. Our
novel method significantly outperformed a clinical-features baseline(AUC:
0.7703 $\pm$ 0.12 vs. 0.5728 $\pm$ 0.12; accuracy: 0.8125 $\pm$ 0.10 vs. 0.6331
$\pm$ 0.09), demonstrating that real-time DSA perfusion dynamics encode
critical insights into microvascular integrity. This approach establishes a
foundation for immediate, accurate no-reflow prediction, enabling clinicians to
proactively manage high-risk patients without reliance on delayed imaging.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) images, acquired through thermal radiation imaging,
are unaffected by variations in lighting conditions and atmospheric haze.
However, TIR images inherently lack color and texture information, limiting
downstream tasks and potentially causing visual fatigue. Existing colorization
methods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information
and insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image
distortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery
provides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details
and enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative
adversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral
information to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework
employs a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as
the generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention
computation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral
attention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and
reducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a
Transformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped
architecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale
wavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency
dual domain. Multiple STformer modules are cascaded to form MTSIC,
progressively optimizing the reconstruction quality. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional
techniques and effectively enhances the visual quality of infrared images.

Abstract: Autoregressive Initial Bits is a framework that integrates sub-image
autoregression and latent variable modeling, demonstrating its advantages in
lossless medical image compression. However, in existing methods, the image
segmentation process leads to an even distribution of latent variable
information across each sub-image, which in turn causes posterior collapse and
inefficient utilization of latent variables. To deal with these issues, we
propose a prediction-based end-to-end lossless medical image compression method
named LVPNet, leveraging global latent variables to predict pixel values and
encoding predicted probabilities for lossless compression. Specifically, we
introduce the Global Multi-scale Sensing Module (GMSM), which extracts compact
and informative latent representations from the entire image, effectively
capturing spatial dependencies within the latent space. Furthermore, to
mitigate the information loss introduced during quantization, we propose the
Quantization Compensation Module (QCM), which learns the distribution of
quantization errors and refines the quantized features to compensate for
quantization loss. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves superior compression efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art lossless image compression approaches, while maintaining
competitive inference speed. The code is at

Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple
imaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional
information, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving
aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore
important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they
require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is
difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present
Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel
pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical
imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring
explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically,
based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text,
M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text
models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving
their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these
modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text
embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images
on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves
state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These
results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving
cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.

Abstract: The overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in
breast cells is a key driver of HER2-positive breast cancer, a highly
aggressive subtype requiring precise diagnosis and targeted therapy.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the standard technique for HER2 assessment but is
costly, labor-intensive, and highly dependent on antibody selection. In
contrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, a routine histopathological
procedure, offers broader accessibility but lacks HER2 specificity. This study
proposes an advanced deep learning-based image translation framework to
generate highfidelity IHC images from H&E-stained tissue samples, enabling
cost-effective and scalable HER2 assessment. By modifying the loss function of
pyramid pix2pix, we mitigate mode collapse, a fundamental limitation in
generative adversarial networks (GANs), and introduce a novel variance-based
penalty that enforces structural diversity in generated images. Our model
particularly excels in translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images, which have
remained challenging for existing methods due to their complex morphological
variations. Extensive evaluations on the BCI histopathological dataset
demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak
signal-tonoise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Frechet
Inception Distance (FID), particularly in accurately translating HER2-positive
(IHC 3+) images. Beyond medical imaging, our model exhibits superior
performance in general image-to-image translation tasks, showcasing its
potential across multiple domains. This work marks a significant step toward
AI-driven precision oncology, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to
traditional HER2 diagnostics.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in

the intrinsic need for multi-modal integration in clinical applications, VLMs
have emerged as a promising solution for a wide range of medical image analysis
tasks. However, adapting general-purpose VLMs to medical domain poses numerous
challenges, such as large domain gaps, complicated pathological variations, and
diversity and uniqueness of different tasks. The central purpose of this review
is to systematically summarize recent advances in adapting VLMs for medical
image analysis, analyzing current challenges, and recommending promising yet
urgent directions for further investigations. We begin by introducing core
learning strategies for medical VLMs, including pretraining, fine-tuning, and
prompt learning. We then categorize five major VLM adaptation strategies for
medical image analysis. These strategies are further analyzed across eleven
medical imaging tasks to illustrate their current practical implementations.
Furthermore, we analyze key challenges that impede the effective adaptation of
VLMs to clinical applications and discuss potential directions for future
research. We also provide an open-access repository of related literature to
facilitate further research, available at

Abstract: Retinal fundus images provide valuable insights into the human eye's interior
structure and crucial features, such as blood vessels, optic disk, macula, and
fovea. However, accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels can be
challenging due to imbalanced data distribution and varying vessel thickness.
In this paper, we propose BLCB-CNN, a novel pipeline based on deep learning and
bi-level class balancing scheme to achieve vessel segmentation in retinal
fundus images. The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels
across vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I
is used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin
vessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus
image is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase
intensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and
background pixels. The resulting balanced dataset is used for
classification-based segmentation of the retinal vascular tree. We evaluate the
proposed scheme on standard retinal fundus images and achieve superior
performance measures, including an area under the ROC curve of 98.23%, Accuracy
of 96.22%, Sensitivity of 81.57%, and Specificity of 97.65%. We also
demonstrate the method's efficacy through external cross-validation on STARE
images, confirming its generalization ability.

Abstract: Synthetic contrast enhancement offers fast image acquisition and eliminates
the need for intravenous injection of contrast agent. This is particularly
beneficial for breast imaging, where long acquisition times and high cost are
significantly limiting the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as
a widespread screening modality. Recent studies have demonstrated the
feasibility of synthetic contrast generation. However, current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods lack sufficient measures for consistent temporal evolution.
Neural cellular automata (NCA) offer a robust and lightweight architecture to
model evolving patterns between neighboring cells or pixels. In this work we
introduce TeNCA (Temporal Neural Cellular Automata), which extends and further
refines NCAs to effectively model temporally sparse, non-uniformly sampled
imaging data. To achieve this, we advance the training strategy by enabling
adaptive loss computation and define the iterative nature of the method to
resemble a physical progression in time. This conditions the model to learn a
physiologically plausible evolution of contrast enhancement. We rigorously
train and test TeNCA on a diverse breast MRI dataset and demonstrate its
effectiveness, surpassing the performance of existing methods in generation of
images that align with ground truth post-contrast sequences.

Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous asymptotic framework for likelihood-based
inference in the Block Maxima (BM) method for stationary time series. While
Bayesian inference under the BM approach has been widely studied in the
independence setting, no asymptotic theory currently exists for time series.
Further results are needed to establish that BM method can be applied with the
kind of dependent time series models relevant to applied fields. To address
this gap we first establish a comprehensive likelihood theory for the
misspecified Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model under serial dependence. Our
results include uniform convergence of the empirical log-likelihood process,
contraction rates for the Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and a local
asymptotically Gaussian expansion. Building on this foundation, we develop the
asymptotic theory of Bayesian inference for the GEV parameters, the extremal
index, $T$-time-horizon return levels, and extreme quantiles (Value at Risk).
Under general conditions on the prior, we prove posterior consistency,
$\sqrt{k}$-contraction rates, Bernstein-von Mises theorems, and asymptotic
coverage properties for credible intervals. For inference on the extremal
index, we propose an adjusted posterior distribution that corrects for poor
coverage exhibited by a naive Bayesian approach. Simulations show excellent
inferential performances for the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Due to their parsimony, separable covariance models have been popular in
modeling matrix-variate data. However, the inference from such a model may be
misleading if the population covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is actually
non-separable, motivating the use of statistical tests of separability.
Likelihood ratio tests have tractable null distributions and good power when
the sample size $n$ is larger than the number of variables $p$, but are not
well-defined otherwise. Other existing separability tests for the $p>n$ case
have low power for small sample sizes, and have null distributions that depend
on unknown parameters, preventing exact error rate control. To address these
issues, we propose novel invariant tests leveraging the core covariance matrix,
a complementary notion to a separable covariance matrix. We show that testing
separability of $\Sigma$ is equivalent to testing sphericity of its core
component. With this insight, we construct test statistics that are
well-defined in high-dimensional settings and have distributions that are
invariant under the null hypothesis of separability, allowing for exact
simulation of null distributions. We study asymptotic null distributions and
prove consistency of our tests in a $p/n\rightarrow\gamma\in(0,\infty)$
asymptotic regime. The large power of our proposed tests relative to existing
procedures is demonstrated numerically.

Abstract: For a $d$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices in which hyperedges are
included i.i.d.\ so that the average degree in the hypergraph is
$n^{\delta+o(1)}$, the projection of such a hypergraph is a graph on the same
$n$ vertices where an edge connects two vertices if and only if they belong to
a same hyperedge. In this work, we study the inference problem where the
observation is a \emph{noisy} version of the graph projection where each edge
in the projection is kept with probability $p=n^{-1+\alpha+o(1)}$ and each edge
not in the projection is added with probability $q=n^{-1+\beta+o(1)}$. For all
constant $d$, we establish sharp thresholds for both detection (distinguishing
the noisy projection from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with edge density
$q$) and reconstruction (estimating the original hypergraph). Notably, our
results reveal a \emph{detection-reconstruction gap} phenomenon in this
problem. Our work also answers a problem raised in \cite{BGPY25+}.

*Marco Avella-Medina,Richard Davis,Gennady Samorodnitsky*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper proposes a truncated inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimator for quantile treatment effects without requiring strict overlap, showing it outperforms standard IPW when propensity scores approach zero. The estimator's distribution follows a stable distribution with convergence rate n^{1-1/γ}, where γ>1 is the tail index of the propensity scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to estimate quantile treatment effects without assuming strict overlap, which is a common limitation in existing methods. This allows for more flexible and realistic applications where propensity scores might be close to zero.

Method: The method involves using an inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach within the potential outcomes framework. The authors introduce a truncated IPW estimator to handle scenarios where propensity scores tend to zero as a regularly varying function, addressing the issues of heavy-tailed objective functions.

Result: The result shows that the truncated IPW estimator outperforms the standard IPW estimator in cases without strict overlap. The limiting distribution of the quantile process is a stable distribution, and the convergence rate is n^{1-1/γ} with γ>1 being the tail index of the propensity scores.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the truncated IPW estimator is effective for estimating quantile treatment effects even when strict overlap is not satisfied, particularly when dealing with extreme propensity scores. This method provides a more robust approach compared to standard IPW under such conditions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating quantile treatment effects without
assuming strict overlap , i.e., we do not assume that the propensity score is
bounded away from zero. More specifically, we consider an inverse probability
weighting (IPW) approach for estimating quantiles in the potential outcomes
framework and pay special attention to scenarios where the propensity scores
can tend to zero as a regularly varying function. Our approach effectively
considers a heavy-tailed objective function for estimating the quantile
process. We introduce a truncated IPW estimator that is shown to outperform the
standard quantile IPW estimator when strict overlap does not hold. We show that
the limiting distribution of the estimated quantile process follows a stable
distribution and converges at the rate $n^{1-1/\gamma}$, where $\gamma>1$ is
the tail index of the propensity scores when they tend to zero. We illustrate
the performance of our estimators in numerical experiments and in a dataset
that exhibits the presence of extreme propensity scores.

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex, dynamic
environments necessitates robust and efficient mechanisms for managing shared
knowledge. A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain
synchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or
inconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper
introduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework
designed to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in
MAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic
voting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the
relevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational
context; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing
importance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different
time horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based
consensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items
are agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in
the presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N
greater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient
inter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage
and similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations
in a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's
efficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%
voting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a
92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an
82% cache hit rate for memory access.

Abstract: Local search plays a central role in many effective heuristic algorithms for
the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and its variants. However, neighborhood
exploration is known to be computationally expensive and time consuming,
especially for large instances or problems with complex constraints. In this
study, we explore a promising direction to address this challenge by
introducing an original tensor-based GPU acceleration method designed to speed
up the commonly used local search operators in vehicle routing. By using an
attribute-based representation, the method offers broad extensibility, making
it applicable to different VRP variants. Its low-coupling architecture, with
intensive computations completely offloaded to the GPU, ensures seamless
integration in various local search-based algorithms and frameworks, leading to
significant improvements in computational efficiency and potentially improved
solution quality. Through comparative experiments on benchmark instances of
three routing problems, we demonstrate the substantial computational advantages
of the proposed approach over traditional CPU-based implementations. We also
provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of the method,
providing valuable insights into its performance characteristics and
identifying potential bottlenecks in practical applications. These findings
contribute to a better understanding and suggest directions for future
improvements.

Abstract: The recent shift in Generative AI (GenAI) applications from cloud-only
environments to end-user devices introduces new challenges in resource
management, system efficiency, and user experience. This paper presents
ConsumerBench, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the
system efficiency and response time of GenAI models running on end-user
devices. Unlike existing benchmarks that assume exclusive model access on
dedicated GPUs, ConsumerBench simulates realistic multi-application scenarios
executing concurrently on constrained hardware. Furthermore, ConsumerBench
supports customizable workflows that simulate complex tasks requiring
coordination among multiple applications. ConsumerBench captures both
application-level metrics, including latency and Service Level Objective (SLO)
attainment, and system-level metrics like CPU/GPU utilization and memory
bandwidth. Through extensive experiments, ConsumerBench reveals inefficiencies
in resource sharing, unfair scheduling under greedy allocation, and performance
pitfalls of static model server configurations. The paper also provides
practical insights for model developers and system designers, highlighting the
benefits of custom kernels tailored to consumer-grade GPU architectures and the
value of implementing SLO-aware scheduling strategies.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in recommendation
systems, the computational and communication bottlenecks caused by their
massive parameter sizes and large data volumes have become increasingly
prominent. This paper systematically investigates two classes of optimization
methods-model parallelism and data parallelism-for distributed training of LLMs
in recommendation scenarios. For model parallelism, we implement both tensor
parallelism and pipeline parallelism, and introduce an adaptive load-balancing
mechanism to reduce cross-device communication overhead. For data parallelism,
we compare synchronous and asynchronous modes, combining gradient compression
and sparsification techniques with an efficient aggregation communication
framework to significantly improve bandwidth utilization. Experiments conducted
on a real-world recommendation dataset in a simulated service environment
demonstrate that our proposed hybrid parallelism scheme increases training
throughput by over 30% and improves resource utilization by approximately 20%
compared to traditional single-mode parallelism, while maintaining strong
scalability and robustness. Finally, we discuss trade-offs among different
parallel strategies in online deployment and outline future directions
involving heterogeneous hardware integration and automated scheduling
technologies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We conclude our work [arXiv:2403.07628, arXiv:2503.12644] on asymptotic
expansions at the soft edge for the classical $n$-dimensional Gaussian and
Laguerre ensembles, now studying the gap-probability generating functions. We
show that the correction terms in the asymptotic expansion are multilinear
forms of the higher-order derivatives of the leading-order term, with certain
rational polynomial coefficients that are independent of the dummy variable. In
this way, the same multilinear structure, with the same polynomial
coefficients, is inherited by the asymptotic expansion of any linearly induced
quantity such as the distribution of the $k$-th largest level. Whereas the
results for the unitary ensembles are presented with proof, the discussion of
the orthogonal and symplectic ones is based on some hypotheses. To substantiate
the hypotheses, we check the result for the $k$-th largest level in the
orthogonal ensembles against simulation data for choices of $n$ and $k$ that
require as many as four correction terms to achieve satisfactory accuracy.

Motivation: To provide a theoretical justification for using greedy heuristics in multi-stage elimination settings and to offer a simple example for understanding related algorithms in high-dimensional applications.

Result: Greedy selection at each stage is optimal for selecting the final maximum-value process.

Conclusion: The result highlights the effectiveness of greedy methods under strong independence assumptions and suggests its potential as a toy example for more complex algorithms.

Abstract: We study an iterative selection problem over N i.i.d. discrete-time
stochastic processes with independent increments. At each stage, a fixed number

Abstract: Edge AI applications increasingly require models that can learn and adapt
on-device with minimal energy budget. Traditional deep learning models, while
powerful, are often overparameterized, energy-hungry, and dependent on cloud
connectivity. Brain-Like Neural Networks (BLNNs), such as the Bayesian
Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), propose a neuromorphic
alternative by mimicking cortical architecture and biologically-constrained
learning. They offer sparse architectures with local learning rules and
unsupervised/semi-supervised learning, making them well-suited for low-power
edge intelligence. However, existing BCPNN implementations rely on GPUs or
datacenter FPGAs, limiting their applicability to embedded systems. This work
presents the first embedded FPGA accelerator for BCPNN on a Zynq UltraScale+
SoC using High-Level Synthesis. We implement both online learning and
inference-only kernels with support for variable and mixed precision. Evaluated
on MNIST, Pneumonia, and Breast Cancer datasets, our accelerator achieves up to
17.5x latency and 94% energy savings over ARM baselines, without sacrificing
accuracy. This work enables practical neuromorphic computing on edge devices,
bridging the gap between brain-like learning and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management,
yet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying
inter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture
evolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph
Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price
prediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into
multi-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively
preserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal
attention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further
evaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's
Tau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10
years of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows),
DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87).
Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means
clustering revealed "high-volatility growth" and "defensive blue-chip" stocks,
with the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations.
Kendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study
innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers,
validating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation
metrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies.
Our framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic
modeling and cross-asset interaction analysis.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across
domains, their long-context capabilities are limited by transient neural
activations causing information decay and unstructured feed-forward network
(FFN) weights leading to semantic fragmentation. Inspired by the brain's
working memory and cortical modularity, we propose PaceLLM, featuring two
innovations: (1) a Persistent Activity (PA) Mechanism that mimics prefrontal
cortex (PFC) neurons' persistent firing by introducing an activation-level
memory bank to dynamically retrieve, reuse, and update critical FFN states,
addressing contextual decay; and (2) Cortical Expert (CE) Clustering that
emulates task-adaptive neural specialization to reorganize FFN weights into
semantic modules, establishing cross-token dependencies and mitigating
fragmentation. Extensive evaluations show that PaceLLM achieves 6% improvement
on LongBench's Multi-document QA and 12.5-17.5% performance gains on
Infinite-Bench tasks, while extending measurable context length to 200K tokens
in Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) tests. This work pioneers brain-inspired LLM
optimization and is complementary to other works. Besides, it can be
generalized to any model and enhance their long-context performance and
interpretability without structural overhauls.

Abstract: Generation IV (Gen-IV) nuclear power plants are envisioned to replace the
current reactor fleet, bringing improvements in performance, safety,
reliability, and sustainability. However, large cost investments currently
inhibit the deployment of these advanced reactor concepts. Digital twins bridge
real-world systems with digital tools to reduce costs, enhance decision-making,
and boost operational efficiency. In this work, a digital twin framework is
designed to operate the Gen-IV Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor,
utilizing data-enhanced methods to optimize operational and maintenance
policies while adhering to system constraints. The closed-loop framework
integrates surrogate modeling, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian inference
to streamline end-to-end communication for online regulation and
self-adjustment. Reinforcement learning is used to consider component health
and degradation to drive the target power generations, with constraints
enforced through a Reference Governor control algorithm that ensures compliance
with pump flow rate and temperature limits. These input driving modules benefit
from detailed online simulations that are assimilated to measurement data with
Bayesian filtering. The digital twin is demonstrated in three case studies: a
one-year long-term operational period showcasing maintenance planning
capabilities, short-term accuracy refinement with high-frequency measurements,
and system shock capturing that demonstrates real-time recalibration
capabilities when change in boundary conditions. These demonstrations validate
robustness for health-aware and constraint-informed nuclear plant operation,
with general applicability to other advanced reactor concepts and complex

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide run-time safety guarantees for autonomous agents that rely on learned components for state estimation, especially when dealing with high-dimensional observations where perception errors are common.

Method: The paper introduces a shield that restricts actions based on state estimates generated by a conformal prediction framework, ensuring that actions are only allowed if they are safe for all possible estimates in the predicted set.

Result: The approach demonstrates a local safety guarantee by restricting actions to those safe across all possible state estimates. It also proves a global safety property for existing shield constructions, ensuring bounded probability of reaching unsafe states when the agent follows the shield's actions.

Conclusion: The proposed shield construction effectively enhances the safety of autonomous agents with imperfect perception by leveraging conformal prediction, as validated by a case study involving autonomous airplane taxi guidance using DNNs.

Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that
use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state
estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield
construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors
by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision
process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal
prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each
observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a
user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed
for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in a local safety
guarantee. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing
shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of
reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the
shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental
autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional
perception DNNs.

Abstract: The explosive growth of artificial intelligence has created gigawatt-scale

power fluctuations exceeding 500 MW within seconds and millisecond-scale
variations of 50-75% of thermal design power. This paper presents a
comprehensive theoretical framework that reconceptualizes Virtual Power Plants
(VPPs) to accommodate these extreme dynamics through a four-layer hierarchical
control architecture operating across timescales from 100 microseconds to 24

  We develop control mechanisms and stability criteria specifically tailored to

traditional VPP architectures, designed for aggregating distributed resources
with response times of seconds to minutes, cannot maintain stability when
confronted with AI data center dynamics exhibiting slew rates exceeding 1,000
MW/s at gigawatt scale.
  Our framework introduces: (1) a sub-millisecond control layer that interfaces
with data center power electronics to actively dampen power oscillations; (2)
new stability criteria incorporating protection system dynamics, demonstrating
that critical clearing times reduce from 150 ms to 83 ms for gigawatt-scale
pulsing loads; and (3) quantified flexibility characterization showing that
workload deferability enables 30% peak reduction while maintaining AI service
availability above 99.95%.
  This work establishes the mathematical foundations necessary for the stable

Abstract: The reliance on distributed renewable energy has increased recently. As a
result, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous
generators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the
microgrid. Most critically, they reduced system inertia and damping. Virtual
synchronous generators emulated in power electronics, which mimic the dynamic
behaviour of synchronous generators, are meant to fix this problem. However,
fixed virtual synchronous generator parameters cannot guarantee a frequency
regulation within the acceptable tolerance range. Conversely, a dynamic
adjustment of these virtual parameters promises robust solution with stable
frequency. This paper proposes a method to adapt the inertia, damping, and
droop parameters dynamically through a fuzzy neural network controller. This
controller trains itself online to choose appropriate values for these virtual
parameters. The proposed method can be applied to a typical AC microgrid by
considering the penetration and impact of renewable energy sources. We study
the system in a MATLAB/Simulink model and validate it experimentally in real
time using hardware-in-the-loop based on an embedded ARM system (SAM3X8E,
Cortex-M3). Compared to traditional and fuzzy logic controller methods, the
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the
frequency deviation to less than 0.03 Hz and shortens the stabilizing/recovery

TL;DR: This paper introduces N-player Overcooked as an extension of the ZSC benchmark for evaluating coordination in multi-agent systems and proposes N-XPlay for zero-shot coordination in multi-team settings, showing better performance than Self-Play in balancing intra and inter-team coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSC methods evaluate coordination between two agents, but real-world systems involve complex interactions in multi-team settings, so there's a need for a more realistic benchmark and method.

Method: The paper introduces N-player Overcooked, an N-agent extension of the ZSC benchmark, and proposes N-XPlay for ZSC in multi-team scenarios.

Result: Agents trained with N-XPlay outperformed Self-Play agents in balancing intra-team and inter-team coordination across two-, three-, and five-player Overcooked scenarios.

Conclusion: N-XPlay is a promising approach for zero-shot coordination in complex multi-team systems, addressing the limitations of existing methods that focus on two-agent interactions.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) -- the ability to collaborate with unfamiliar
partners -- is essential to making autonomous agents effective teammates.
Existing ZSC methods evaluate coordination capabilities between two agents who
have not previously interacted. However, these scenarios do not reflect the
complexity of real-world multi-agent systems, where coordination often involves
a hierarchy of sub-groups and interactions between teams of agents, known as
Multi-Team Systems (MTS). To address this gap, we first introduce N-player
Overcooked, an N-agent extension of the popular two-agent ZSC benchmark,
enabling evaluation of ZSC in N-agent scenarios. We then propose N-XPlay for
ZSC in N-agent, multi-team settings. Comparison against Self-Play across two-,
three- and five-player Overcooked scenarios, where agents are split between an
``ego-team'' and a group of unseen collaborators shows that agents trained with
N-XPlay are better able to simultaneously balance ``intra-team'' and
``inter-team'' coordination than agents trained with SP.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital for
navigating the ever-expanding body of scientific literature, particularly in
high-stakes domains such as chemistry. Despite the promise of RAG, foundational
design choices -- such as how documents are segmented and represented -- remain
underexplored in domain-specific contexts. This study presents the first
large-scale, systematic evaluation of chunking strategies and embedding models
tailored to chemistry-focused RAG systems. We investigate 25 chunking
configurations across five method families and evaluate 48 embedding models on
three chemistry-specific benchmarks, including the newly introduced
QuestChemRetrieval dataset. Our results reveal that recursive token-based
chunking (specifically R100-0) consistently outperforms other approaches,
offering strong performance with minimal resource overhead. We also find that
retrieval-optimized embeddings -- such as Nomic and Intfloat E5 variants --
substantially outperform domain-specialized models like SciBERT. By releasing
our datasets, evaluation framework, and empirical benchmarks, we provide
actionable guidelines for building effective and efficient chemistry-aware RAG
systems.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are designed to retrieve candidate items a user
might be interested in from a large pool. A common approach is using graph
neural networks (GNNs) to capture high-order interaction relationships. As
large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across domains,
researchers are exploring their use to enhance recommendation. However, prior
work limits LLMs to re-ranking results or dataset augmentation, failing to
utilize their power during candidate filtering - which may lead to suboptimal
performance. Instead, we propose to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities during
the candidate filtering process, and introduce Chain Of Retrieval ON grAphs
(CORONA) to progressively narrow down the range of candidate items on
interaction graphs with the help of LLMs: (1) First, LLM performs preference
reasoning based on user profiles, with the response serving as a query to
extract relevant users and items from the interaction graph as
preference-assisted retrieval; (2) Then, using the information retrieved in the
previous step along with the purchase history of target user, LLM conducts
intent reasoning to help refine an even smaller interaction subgraph as
intent-assisted retrieval; (3) Finally, we employ a GNN to capture high-order
collaborative filtering information from the extracted subgraph, performing
GNN-enhanced retrieval to generate the final recommendation results. The
proposed framework leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs during the
retrieval process, while seamlessly integrating GNNs to enhance overall
recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
settings demonstrate that our proposed CORONA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an 18.6% relative improvement in recall and an 18.4% relative
improvement in NDCG on average.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by
incorporating external knowledge at inference time. However, graph-based RAG
systems often suffer from structural overhead and imprecise retrieval: they
require costly pipelines for entity linking and relation extraction, yet
frequently return subgraphs filled with loosely related or tangential content.
This stems from a fundamental flaw -- semantic similarity does not imply
semantic relevance. We introduce SlimRAG, a lightweight framework for retrieval
without graphs. SlimRAG replaces structure-heavy components with a simple yet
effective entity-aware mechanism. At indexing time, it constructs a compact
entity-to-chunk table based on semantic embeddings. At query time, it
identifies salient entities, retrieves and scores associated chunks, and
assembles a concise, contextually relevant input -- without graph traversal or
edge construction. To quantify retrieval efficiency, we propose Relative Index
Token Utilization (RITU), a metric measuring the compactness of retrieved
content. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that SlimRAG
outperforms strong flat and graph-based baselines in accuracy while reducing
index size and RITU (e.g., 16.31 vs. 56+), highlighting the value of
structure-free, entity-centric context selection. The code will be released
soon. https://github.com/continue-ai-company/SlimRAG

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of efficiently retrieving high-quality information from a vast number of publications related to pandemics like COVID-19, which current parsing tools cannot adequately handle.

Method: The method involves using large language models (LLMs) to extract hidden relationships from unlabeled publications, improving the retrieval system's ability to provide useful information.

Result: The result is the development of Covrelex-SE, which offers more high-quality search results by utilizing LLMs to uncover relationships that traditional tools miss.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that employing LLMs in retrieval systems can significantly enhance information quality during pandemics, offering a valuable approach for future unexpected health crises.

Abstract: In recent years, with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous
publications relevant to this disease have been issued. Because of the massive
volume of publications, an efficient retrieval system is necessary to provide
researchers with useful information if an unexpected pandemic happens so
suddenly, like COVID-19. In this work, we present a method to help the
retrieval system, the Covrelex-SE system, to provide more high-quality search
results. We exploited the power of the large language models (LLMs) to extract
the hidden relationships inside the unlabeled publication that cannot be found
by the current parsing tools that the system is using. Since then, help the
system to have more useful information during retrieval progress.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that combining retrieval with LLMs is effective for citation prediction, suggesting potential for improving academic referencing systems.

Abstract: The Citation Discovery Shared Task focuses on predicting the correct citation
from a given candidate pool for a given paragraph. The main challenges stem
from the length of the abstract paragraphs and the high similarity among

To address this, we develop a system that first retrieves the top-k most
similar abstracts based on extracted relational features from the given

accurately identify the most relevant citation. We evaluate our framework on
the training dataset provided by the SCIDOCA 2025 organizers, demonstrating its

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature challenges researchers
extracting and synthesizing knowledge. Traditional search engines return many
sources without direct, detailed answers, while general-purpose LLMs may offer
concise responses that lack depth or omit current information. LLMs with search
capabilities are also limited by context window, yielding short, incomplete
answers. This paper introduces WISE (Workflow for Intelligent Scientific
Knowledge Extraction), a system addressing these limits by using a structured
workflow to extract, refine, and rank query-specific knowledge. WISE uses an
LLM-powered, tree-based architecture to refine data, focusing on query-aligned,
context-aware, and non-redundant information. Dynamic scoring and ranking
prioritize unique contributions from each source, and adaptive stopping
criteria minimize processing overhead. WISE delivers detailed, organized
answers by systematically exploring and synthesizing knowledge from diverse
sources. Experiments on HBB gene-associated diseases demonstrate WISE reduces
processed text by over 80% while achieving significantly higher recall over
baselines like search engines and other LLM-based approaches. ROUGE and BLEU
metrics reveal WISE's output is more unique than other systems, and a novel
level-based metric shows it provides more in-depth information. We also explore
how the WISE workflow can be adapted for diverse domains like drug discovery,
material science, and social science, enabling efficient knowledge extraction
and synthesis from unstructured scientific papers and web sources.

Abstract: In real-world recommendation systems, users would engage in variety
scenarios, such as homepages, search pages, and related recommendation pages.
Each of these scenarios would reflect different aspects users focus on.
However, the user interests may be inconsistent in different scenarios, due to
differences in decision-making processes and preference expression. This
variability complicates unified modeling, making multi-scenario learning a
significant challenge. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement
learning approach that models user preferences across scenarios by modeling
user interest evolution across multiple scenarios. Our method employs Double
Q-learning to enhance next-item prediction accuracy and optimizes contrastive
learning loss using Q-value to make model performance better. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
multi-scenario recommendation tasks. Our work offers a fresh perspective on
multi-scenario modeling and highlights promising directions for future

Abstract: Current recommendation systems often require some form of textual data
summarization, such as generating concise and coherent titles for product
carousels or other grouped item displays. While large language models have
shown promise in NLP domains for textual summarization, these approaches do not
directly apply to recommendation systems, where explanations must be highly
relevant to the core features of item sets, adhere to strict word limit
constraints. In this paper, we propose CARTS (Collaborative Agents for
Recommendation Textual Summarization), a multi-agent LLM framework designed for
structured summarization in recommendation systems. CARTS decomposes the task
into three stages-Generation Augmented Generation (GAG), refinement circle, and
arbitration, where successive agent roles are responsible for extracting
salient item features, iteratively refining candidate titles based on relevance
and length feedback, and selecting the final title through a collaborative
arbitration process. Experiments on large-scale e-commerce data and live A/B
testing show that CARTS significantly outperforms single-pass and
chain-of-thought LLM baselines, delivering higher title relevance and improved
user engagement metrics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems relies on high-quality manual
relevance judgments (qrels), which are costly and time-consuming to obtain.
While pooling reduces the annotation effort, it results in only partially
labeled datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative to
reducing reliance on manual judgments, particularly in complex domains like
medical case-based retrieval, where relevance assessment requires analyzing
both textual and visual information. In this work, we explore using a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to expand relevance judgments, creating
a new dataset of automated judgments. Specifically, we employ Gemini 1.5 Pro on
the ImageCLEFmed 2013 case-based retrieval task, simulating human assessment
through an iteratively refined, structured prompting strategy that integrates
binary scoring, instruction-based evaluation, and few-shot learning. We
systematically experimented with various prompt configurations to maximize
agreement with human judgments. To evaluate agreement between the MLLM and
human judgments, we use Cohen's Kappa, achieving a substantial agreement score
of 0.6, comparable to inter-annotator agreement typically observed in
multimodal retrieval tasks. Starting from the original 15,028 manual judgments
(4.72% relevant) across 35 topics, our MLLM-based approach expanded the dataset
by over 37x to 558,653 judgments, increasing relevant annotations to 5,950. On
average, each medical case query received 15,398 new annotations, with
approximately 99% being non-relevant, reflecting the high sparsity typical in
this domain. Our results demonstrate the potential of MLLMs to scale relevance
judgment collection, offering a promising direction for supporting retrieval
evaluation in medical and multimodal IR tasks.

Abstract: Life sciences research increasingly requires identifying, accessing, and
effectively processing data from an ever-evolving array of information sources
on the Linked Open Data (LOD) network. This dynamic landscape places a
significant burden on researchers, as the quality of query responses depends
heavily on the selection and semantic integration of data sources --processes
that are often labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly. While the adoption of
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles has
aimed to address these challenges, barriers to efficient and accurate
scientific data processing persist.
  In this paper, we introduce FAIRBridge, an experimental natural
language-based query processing system designed to empower scientists to
discover, access, and query biological databases, even when they are not
FAIR-compliant. FAIRBridge harnesses the capabilities of AI to interpret query
intents, map them to relevant databases described in scientific literature, and
generate executable queries via intelligent resource access plans. The system
also includes robust tools for mitigating low-quality query processing,
ensuring high fidelity and responsiveness in the information delivered.
  FAIRBridge's autonomous query processing framework enables users to explore
alternative data sources, make informed choices at every step, and leverage
community-driven crowd curation when needed. By providing a user-friendly,
automated hypothesis-testing platform in natural English, FAIRBridge
significantly enhances the integration and processing of scientific data,
offering researchers a powerful new tool for advancing their inquiries.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that multimodal data integration and attention mechanisms are effective for cross-domain sequential recommendation, and the source code will be released.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by
leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on

enhances textual information with Large Language Models (LLM) knowledge and
significantly improves recommendation performance through the fusion of visual

embeddings, thereby enriching item representations with multimodal data. A
multiple attention mechanism jointly learns both single-domain and cross-domain
preferences, effectively capturing and understanding complex user interests
across diverse domains. Evaluations conducted on four e-commerce datasets
demonstrate that LLM-EMF consistently outperforms existing methods in modeling
cross-domain user preferences, thereby highlighting the effectiveness of
multimodal data integration and its advantages in enhancing sequential

Abstract: User profiling is pivotal for recommendation systems, as it transforms raw
user interaction data into concise and structured representations that drive
personalized recommendations. While traditional embedding-based profiles lack
interpretability and adaptability, recent advances with large language models
(LLMs) enable text-based profiles that are semantically richer and more
transparent. However, existing methods often adhere to fixed formats that limit
their ability to capture the full diversity of user behaviors. In this paper,
we introduce LettinGo, a novel framework for generating diverse and adaptive
user profiles. By leveraging the expressive power of LLMs and incorporating
direct feedback from downstream recommendation tasks, our approach avoids the
rigid constraints imposed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Instead, we employ
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the profile generator with
task-specific performance, ensuring that the profiles remain adaptive and
effective. LettinGo operates in three stages: (1) exploring diverse user
profiles via multiple LLMs, (2) evaluating profile quality based on their
impact in recommendation systems, and (3) aligning the profile generation
through pairwise preference data derived from task performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances recommendation
accuracy, flexibility, and contextual awareness. This work enhances profile
generation as a key innovation for next-generation recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recommendation systems play a crucial role in our daily lives by impacting
user experience across various domains, including e-commerce, job

lives, practitioners must ensure they do not produce unfair and imbalanced
recommendations. Previous work addressing bias in recommendations overlooked
bias in certain item categories, potentially leaving some biases unaddressed.
Additionally, most previous work on fair re-ranking focused on binary-sensitive
attributes. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a
fairness-aware re-ranking approach that helps mitigate bias in different
categories of items. This re-ranking approach leverages existing biases to
correct disparities in recommendations across various demographic groups. We
show how our approach can mitigate bias on multiple sensitive attributes,
including gender, age, and occupation. We experimented on three real-world
datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our re-ranking scheme in mitigating
bias in recommendations. Our results show how this approach helps mitigate
social bias with little to no degradation in performance.

Abstract: With the expansion of business scales and scopes on online platforms,
multi-scenario matching has become a mainstream solution to reduce maintenance

recommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all
scenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However,
existing methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation
of personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an
innovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into
multi-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based
on user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to
capture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of
preferences shared across scenarios. Additionally, we leverage vector
quantization techniques to distil scenario-aware preferences from users'
behavior sequence within individual scenarios, facilitating user-specific and
scenario-aware preference modeling. To enhance efficient and flexible
information transfer, we introduce a progressive scenario-aware gated linear
unit that allows fine-grained, low-latency fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PERSCEN outperforms existing methods. Further efficiency
analysis confirms that PERSCEN effectively balances performance with
computational cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world industrial
systems.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that BlenderFusion provides a significant improvement in scene compositing through its integration of 3D editing and generative models.

Abstract: We present BlenderFusion, a generative visual compositing framework that

Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a
coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative
compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original

modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering,
facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion
significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have made significant advances
in surface reconstruction. However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes
remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic
appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the
application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a
novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details,
supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine
strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene
partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we
integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations
and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects.
Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view
regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the
publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned
aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing
NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results
and accurate surface from full-size image optimization. Open-source code will

Abstract: Recent advances in texture compression provide major improvements in
compression ratios, but cannot use the GPU's texture units for decompression
and filtering. This has led to the development of stochastic texture filtering
(STF) techniques to avoid the high cost of multiple texel evaluations with such
formats. Unfortunately, those methods can give undesirable visual appearance
changes under magnification and may contain visible noise and flicker despite
the use of spatiotemporal denoisers. Recent work substantially improves the
quality of magnification filtering with STF by sharing decoded texel values
between nearby pixels (Wronski 2025). Using GPU wave communication intrinsics,
this sharing can be performed inside actively executing shaders without memory
traffic overhead. We take this idea further and present novel algorithms that
use wave communication between lanes to avoid repeated texel decompression
prior to filtering. By distributing unique work across lanes, we can achieve
zero-error filtering using <=1 texel evaluations per pixel given a sufficiently
large magnification factor. For the remaining cases, we propose novel filtering
fallback methods that also achieve higher quality than prior approaches.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for
accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to
reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking
advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.
Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with
each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,
but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling
efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash
model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the
observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash
model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the
Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot
models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly
attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime
efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Direct volume rendering (DVR) is a fundamental technique for visualizing
volumetric data, with transfer functions (TFs) playing a crucial role in
extracting meaningful structures. However, designing effective TFs remains
unintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameter space.
Researchers have developed numerous TF optimization methods to bridge this gap.
However, existing methods still face two challenges: large exploration space
and weak generalizability. To address these issues, we propose What You Think
is What You Get (WYTWYG) framework, which leveraging Multi-model Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to guide the TF optimization based on user intent. Specifically,
we first introduce a novel TF optimization approach comprising two core
components: (1) an evolution-based explorer for effective exploration of the TF
space, and (2) a volume rendering quality evaluator based on MLLMs to provide
generalizable visual guidance. We further propose a TF interactive design
system based on this approach. We demonstrate the general applicability of our
framework through three case studies, and validate the effectiveness of each
component through extensive experiments. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: BulletGen uses generative models to improve dynamic scene representation from monocular videos by aligning with 4D reconstruction at a frozen bullet-time step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of transforming monocular videos into immersive experiences due to reconstruction of unseen regions and depth ambiguity.

Method: Aligning diffusion-based video generation outputs with 4D reconstruction at a bullet-time step to supervise 4D Gaussian model optimization.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis and 2D/3D tracking by combining generative content with scene components.

Conclusion: BulletGen effectively enhances dynamic scene representation by leveraging generative models to correct errors and fill gaps.

Abstract: Transforming casually captured, monocular videos into fully immersive dynamic
experiences is a highly ill-posed task, and comes with significant challenges,
e.g., reconstructing unseen regions, and dealing with the ambiguity in
monocular depth estimation. In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach
that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete
missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is
done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with
the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated
frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model.
Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic
scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view
synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present DuetGen, a novel framework for generating interactive two-person
dances from music. The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent
complexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to
synchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent
advances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding
two-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from
music. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both
dancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and
adopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage
utilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at
a coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,
producing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.
Subsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to
map music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level
semantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic
tokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to
predict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to
iteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during
inference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction
representation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive
two-person dances across various genres. Extensive experiments and user studies
on a benchmark duet dance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
DuetGen in motion realism, music-dance alignment, and partner coordination.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets
remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1)
the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and
(2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world
complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that
enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along
with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct
RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147
categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels.
Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that
combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop
refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve
sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization
along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language
instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We
instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot
embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert
trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success
and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model
fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%)
on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our
synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization
without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark,
dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments
remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on
task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability.
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding
human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot
integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations,
and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation
Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an
LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools
available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously
defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic
modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation
actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously
unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design.
Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation,
and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed
input representations, or pre-existing maps.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual
reasoning abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled
robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in
environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or
industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small
language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal
human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM
automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from
the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in
replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners
for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we
demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of
GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further
demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic
platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines adaptability and formal safety in robotic navigation, offering a promising approach for future space exploration missions.

Abstract: Safe, reliable navigation in extreme, unfamiliar terrain is required for
future robotic space exploration missions. Recent generative-AI methods learn
semantically aware navigation policies from large, cross-embodiment datasets,

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world
environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate
test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to
enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that
the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples
follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the
existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we
introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment,
RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian
perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution,
and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the
optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training
such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic
dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through
extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing
VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25%
absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 8% on in-distribution
tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that
fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase
compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of considering real-world payloads and disturbances in training AUV docking controllers to improve robustness.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) docking in dynamic and uncertain
environments is a critical challenge for underwater robotics. Reinforcement
learning is a promising method for developing robust controllers, but the
disparity between training simulations and the real world, or the sim2real gap,
often leads to a significant deterioration in performance. In this work, we
perform a simulation study on reducing the sim2real gap in autonomous docking
through training various controllers and then evaluating them under realistic
disturbances. In particular, we focus on the real-world challenge of docking
under different payloads that are potentially outside the original training
distribution. We explore existing methods for improving robustness including
randomization techniques and history-conditioned controllers. Our findings
provide insights into mitigating the sim2real gap when training docking
controllers. Furthermore, our work indicates areas of future research that may

Result: The approach demonstrated consistency and provided a criterion for improving the handover position in an industrial environment with a camera system.

Conclusion: The integration of explainable AI in Cobot grasping algorithms enhances safety and reliability, making neural networks more transparent for critical applications.

Abstract: Neural networks are often regarded as universal equations that can estimate
any function. This flexibility, however, comes with the drawback of high
complexity, rendering these networks into black box models, which is especially
relevant in safety-centric applications. To that end, we propose a pipeline for
a collaborative robot (Cobot) grasping algorithm that detects relevant tools
and generates the optimal grasp. To increase the transparency and reliability
of this approach, we integrate an explainable AI method that provides an
explanation for the underlying prediction of a model by extracting the learned
features and correlating them to corresponding classes from the input. These
concepts are then used as additional criteria to ensure the safe handling of
work tools. In this paper, we show the consistency of this approach and the
criterion for improving the handover position. This approach was tested in an
industrial environment, where a camera system was set up to enable a robot to

Finally, limitations related to environmental realism, sensor noise modeling,

Abstract: Active event perception, the ability to dynamically detect, track, and

such as human-AI collaboration, assistive robotics, and autonomous navigation.
However, existing approaches often depend on predefined action spaces,
annotated datasets, and extrinsic rewards, limiting their adaptability and
scalability in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Inspired by cognitive theories of
event perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised
framework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied
control through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and
entropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and
actively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or
external rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an
action-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with
observations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target
continuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve
privacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation
for embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of balancing positioning accuracy and system robustness in LiDAR SLAM under dynamic object interference, point cloud noise, and unstructured environments.

Method: The method includes designing a Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict and remove dynamic feature points, a Global Importance Scoring Head to select high-contribution features and suppress noise, and a Cross Layer Intra-Graph Convolution Module (GLI-GCN) to fuse multi-scale neighborhood structures for better feature discrimination.

Result: The result shows that ADA-DPM achieved outstanding performance on several public datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving both positioning accuracy and system robustness.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that ADA-DPM is an effective adaptive noise filtering SLAM strategy that successfully balances accuracy and robustness in challenging environments with dynamic objects, noise, and unstructured settings.

Abstract: LiDAR SLAM has demonstrated significant application value in various fields,
including mobile robot navigation and high-precision map construction. However,
existing methods often need to make a trade-off between positioning accuracy
and system robustness when faced with dynamic object interference, point cloud
noise, and unstructured environments. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive noise filtering SLAM strategy-ADA-DPM, achieving excellent preference
in both aspects. We design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict the
category of feature points belonging to dynamic points, to eliminate dynamic
feature points; design the Global Importance Scoring Head to adaptively select
feature points with higher contribution and features while suppressing noise
interference; and construct the Cross Layer Intra-Graph Convolution Module
(GLI-GCN) to fuse multi-scale neighborhood structures, thereby enhancing the
discriminative ability of overlapping features. Finally, to further validate
the effectiveness of our method, we tested it on several publicly available

Abstract: Achieving reliable ego motion estimation for agile robots, e.g., aerobatic
aircraft, remains challenging because most robot sensors fail to respond timely
and clearly to highly dynamic robot motions, often resulting in measurement
blurring, distortion, and delays. In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and
feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity
estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two
types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar,
First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive
rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated
association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more
robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more
computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we
propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and
event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged
smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively
in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free
and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and
efficient velocity output in challenging environments. The source code,

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in
applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and
localization. Extracting meaningful local descriptors from a query point cloud
that can be matched with the descriptors of the collected point clouds is a
challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has
been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we
propose a novel methodology, named TDACloud, using Topological Data Analysis
(TDA) for local descriptor extraction from a point cloud, which does not need
resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we
used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. Unlike
voxelization, our proposed technique can take raw point clouds as inputs and
outputs a fixed-size TDA-descriptor vector. To test the quality of the proposed
TDACloud technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford
RobotCar, KITTI-360) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for
object and place recognition. We have also tested TDACloud on noisy and
transformed test cases where the query point cloud has been scaled, translated,
or rotated. Our results demonstrate high recognition accuracies in noisy
conditions and large-scale real-world place recognition while outperforming the
baselines by up to approximately 14%.

to influence the image acquisition process. As a result, AE methods have
traditionally been benchmarked in an online manner, rendering experiments
non-reproducible. Building on our prior work, we propose a methodology that
utilizes an emulator capable of generating images at any exposure time. This
approach leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset, along
with its new extension, in which data was acquired along a repeated trajectory
at different times of the day to assess the impact of changing illumination. In
total, BorealHDR covers 13.4 km over 59 trajectories in challenging lighting
conditions. The dataset also includes lidar-inertial-odometry-based maps with
pose estimation for each image frame, as well as Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) data for comparison. We demonstrate that by using images acquired
at various exposure times, we can emulate realistic images with a
Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78% compared to ground truth images.
Using this offline approach, we benchmarked eight AE methods, concluding that
the classical AE method remains the field's best performer. To further support
reproducibility, we provide in-depth details on the development of our backpack
acquisition platform, including hardware, electrical components, and
performance specifications. Additionally, we share valuable lessons learned
from deploying the backpack over more than 25 km across various environments.

### [423] [GRAND-SLAM: Local Optimization for Globally Consistent Large-Scale Multi-Agent Gaussian SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18885)
*Annika Thomas,Aneesa Sonawalla,Alex Rose,Jonathan P. How*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRAND-SLAM is a collaborative 3D Gaussian splatting SLAM method for multi-agent outdoor environments, improving tracking and rendering performance compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian splatting is effective for RGB-D visual SLAM but hasn't been applied to large-scale, multi-agent outdoor settings. Existing multi-agent methods are limited to small indoor environments, so there's a need for a scalable solution.

Method: GRAND-SLAM integrates an implicit tracking module using local optimization over submaps and a pose-graph optimization framework with inter- and intra-robot loop closure.

Result: GRAND-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking, 28% higher PSNR on Replica dataset, and 91% lower tracking error on Kimera-Multi dataset with better rendering.

Conclusion: GRAND-SLAM offers a scalable, collaborative approach for multi-agent outdoor SLAM, enhancing both tracking and reconstruction quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an expressive scene representation for
RGB-D visual SLAM, but its application to large-scale, multi-agent outdoor
environments remains unexplored. Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising
approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering
scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to
small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian
Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative
Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module
based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and
intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework.
Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance
and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as
well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over
existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite growing interest in Learning-by-Teaching (LbT), few studies have
explored how this paradigm can be implemented with autonomous, peer-like social
robots in real classrooms. Most prior work has relied on scripted or
Wizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time,
interactive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study
addresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a
cognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject
experiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or
practiced independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary
(memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by
Interactive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the
LbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those
in the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with
lower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural
metrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and
engaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions:
(1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable
model for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the
feasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real
classrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing
that social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive
partners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning
outcomes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments
remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on
motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to
ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions.
We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables
robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo
camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute
localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in
the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight
object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based
filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These
measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full
6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive
controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.
To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online
from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling
real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate
NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest
trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss
and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each
experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess
resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile
target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that
high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard
sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) offer a promising pathway for unified world
modeling in robotics by integrating simulation, prediction, and manipulation.
However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration
speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between
imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose
Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model
framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation.
MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features,
while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction.
This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with
coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a
video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training
strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically,
we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their
intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model
better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also
functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in
latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can
preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves
state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of
unified world modeling in robotics.

*Mostafa Shahin,Beena Ahmed,Julien Epps*

TL;DR: This paper introduces a zero-shot speech-based method for detecting cognitive impairment using Qwen2-Audio AudioLLM, showing comparable performance and good generalizability across languages and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cognitive impairment is a significant public health issue, and early detection is crucial. Speech is a promising biomarker, but traditional methods need manual annotation and don't generalize well.

Method: The paper proposes a zero-shot approach using Qwen2-Audio AudioLLM, which processes audio and text. They design prompt-based instructions to classify speech samples as normal or impaired.

Result: The zero-shot AudioLLM method performs as well as supervised methods and shows good generalizability and consistency across languages, tasks, and datasets.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for CI detection without manual annotation, suggesting potential for broader application in different languages and tasks.

Abstract: Cognitive impairment (CI) is of growing public health concern, and early
detection is vital for effective intervention. Speech has gained attention as a
non-invasive and easily collectible biomarker for assessing cognitive decline.
Traditional CI detection methods typically rely on supervised models trained on
acoustic and linguistic features extracted from speech, which often require
manual annotation and may not generalise well across datasets and languages. In
this work, we propose the first zero-shot speech-based CI detection method
using the Qwen2- Audio AudioLLM, a model capable of processing both audio and
text inputs. By designing prompt-based instructions, we guide the model in
classifying speech samples as indicative of normal cognition or cognitive
impairment. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: one in English and
another multilingual, spanning different cognitive assessment tasks. Our
results show that the zero-shot AudioLLM approach achieves performance
comparable to supervised methods and exhibits promising generalizability and
consistency across languages, tasks, and datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The recent rise in capabilities of AI-based music generation tools has
created an upheaval in the music industry, necessitating the creation of
accurate methods to detect such AI-generated content. This can be done using
audio-based detectors; however, it has been shown that they struggle to
generalize to unseen generators or when the audio is perturbed. Furthermore,
recent work used accurate and cleanly formatted lyrics sourced from a lyrics
provider database to detect AI-generated music. However, in practice, such
perfect lyrics are not available (only the audio is); this leaves a substantial
gap in applicability in real-life use cases. In this work, we instead propose
solving this gap by transcribing songs using general automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models. We do this using several detectors. The results on
diverse, multi-genre, and multi-lingual lyrics show generally strong detection
performance across languages and genres, particularly for our best-performing
model using Whisper large-v2 and LLM2Vec embeddings. In addition, we show that
our method is more robust than state-of-the-art audio-based ones when the audio
is perturbed in different ways and when evaluated on different music
generators. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate detection of disfluencies in spoken language is crucial for
enhancing the performance of automatic speech and language processing systems,
as well as fostering the development of more inclusive speech and language
technologies. Leveraging the growing trend of large language models (LLMs) as
versatile learners capable of processing both lexical and non-lexical inputs
(e.g., audio and video), we propose a novel approach to transcribing
disfluencies as explicit tokens with timestamps, enabling the generation of
fully annotated disfluency-rich transcripts. Our method integrates acoustic
representations extracted from an audio encoder with textual inputs of varying
quality: clean transcriptions without disfluencies, time-aligned transcriptions
from aligners, or outputs from phoneme-based ASR models -- all of which may
contain imperfections. Importantly, our experiments demonstrate that textual
inputs do not need to be flawless. As long as they include timestamp-related
cues, LLMs can effectively smooth the input and produce fully
disfluency-annotated transcripts, underscoring their robustness in handling
imperfect hints.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite progress in controllable symbolic music generation, data scarcity
remains a challenge for certain control modalities. Composer-style music
generation is a prime example, as only a few pieces per composer are available,
limiting the modeling of both styles and fundamental music elements (e.g.,
melody, chord, rhythm). In this paper, we investigate how general music
knowledge learned from a broad corpus can enhance the mastery of specific
composer styles, with a focus on piano piece generation. Our approach follows a
two-stage training paradigm. First, we pre-train a REMI-based music generation
model on a large corpus of pop, folk, and classical music. Then, we fine-tune
it on a small, human-verified dataset from four renowned composers, namely
Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, using a lightweight adapter module to
condition the model on style indicators. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we conduct both objective and subjective evaluations on style
accuracy and musicality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms ablations and baselines, achieving more precise composer-style
modeling and better musical aesthetics. Additionally, we provide observations
on how the model builds music concepts from the generality pre-training and
refines its stylistic understanding through the mastery fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a unified audio model that can handle multiple domains (speech, sound, music) instead of being domain-specific, which allows for more versatile and efficient models.

Method: USAD uses layer-to-layer distillation from domain-specific SSL models to train a student model on a diverse audio dataset.

Result: USAD performs competitively across multiple tasks and datasets, achieving near state-of-the-art results on SUPERB and HEAR benchmarks with a single encoder.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that USAD provides a unified approach to audio representation learning, effectively integrating different audio types into one model while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized audio representations, yet
models often remain domain-specific, focusing on either speech or non-speech
tasks. In this work, we present Universal Speech and Audio Distillation (USAD),
a unified approach to audio representation learning that integrates diverse
audio types - speech, sound, and music - into a single model. USAD employs
efficient layer-to-layer distillation from domain-specific SSL models to train
a student on a comprehensive audio dataset. USAD offers competitive performance
across various benchmarks and datasets, including frame and instance-level
speech processing tasks, audio tagging, and sound classification, achieving
near state-of-the-art results with a single encoder on SUPERB and HEAR

Abstract: Recent advances in music foundation models have improved audio representation

model developed to enhance cross-cultural music representation learning and
understanding. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage continual pre-training
strategy that integrates learning rate re-warming and re-decaying, enabling
stable adaptation even with limited computational resources. Training on a
650-hour multi-cultural data mix, comprising Greek, Turkish, and Indian music
traditions, results in an average improvement of 4.9% in ROC-AUC and AP across
diverse non-Western music auto-tagging tasks, surpassing prior
state-of-the-art, with minimal forgetting on Western-centric benchmarks. We
further investigate task arithmetic, an alternative approach to multi-cultural
adaptation that merges single-culture adapted models in the weight space. Task
arithmetic performs on par with our multi-culturally trained model on
non-Western auto-tagging tasks and shows no regression on Western datasets.
Cross-cultural evaluation reveals that single-culture models transfer with
varying effectiveness across musical traditions, whereas the multi-culturally
adapted model achieves the best overall performance. To support research on
world music representation learning, we publicly release CultureMERT-95M and
CultureMERT-TA-95M, fostering the development of more culturally aware music

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its
wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group
choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing
methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer
foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this
paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to
generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer
collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the
relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a
distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within
plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we
introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design
a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For
long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling
strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional
information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder
layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and
coherent group dance generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved multichannel
speech enhancement algorithms, yet conventional training loss functions such as
the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) may fail to preserve
fine-grained spectral cues essential for phoneme intelligibility. In this work,
we propose perceptually-informed variants of the SDR loss, formulated in the
time-frequency domain and modulated by frequency-dependent weighting schemes.
These weights are designed to emphasize time-frequency regions where speech is
prominent or where the interfering noise is particularly strong. We investigate
both fixed and adaptive strategies, including ANSI band-importance weights,
spectral magnitude-based weighting, and dynamic weighting based on the relative
amount of speech and noise. We train the FaSNet multichannel speech enhancement
model using these various losses. Experimental results show that while standard
metrics such as the SDR are only marginally improved, their perceptual
frequency-weighted counterparts exhibit a more substantial improvement.
Besides, spectral and phoneme-level analysis indicates better consonant
reconstruction, which points to a better preservation of certain acoustic cues.

to 61.1%, while requiring 6.75 times fewer trainable parameters than
state-of-the-art fine-tuning mechanisms, using the same pre-trained diffusion
Transformer model of Stable Audio Open. We evaluate various forms of musical

Motivation: OpenFst supports $\\_phi$-transitions but has implementation constraints that prevent their direct use, so the authors aim to find an alternative way to utilize them effectively.

Method: The authors use the Gallic semiring functionality in OpenFst to correctly implement $\\_phi$-transductions.

Result: They successfully demonstrate the implementation of $\\_phi$-transductions using the Gallic semiring and provide code examples for the MaxMatch (WordPiece) tokenization algorithm.

Conclusion: By leveraging the Gallic semiring, the paper shows that $\\_phi$-transductions can be implemented effectively in OpenFst despite the original constraints.

Abstract: OpenFst, a popular finite-state transducer library, supports
$\varphi$-transitions but, due to an implementation constraint, they cannot be
used with transducers in a straightforward way.
  In this short tutorial, we describe how one can use other functionality

Abstract: Understanding and modeling enzyme-substrate interactions is crucial for
catalytic mechanism research, enzyme engineering, and metabolic engineering.
Although a large number of predictive methods have emerged, they do not
incorporate prior knowledge of enzyme catalysis to rationally modulate general
protein-molecule features that are misaligned with catalytic patterns. To
address this issue, we introduce a two-stage progressive framework, OmniESI,
for enzyme-substrate interaction prediction through conditional deep learning.
By decomposing the modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions into a two-stage
progressive process, OmniESI incorporates two conditional networks that
respectively emphasize enzymatic reaction specificity and crucial
catalysis-related interactions, facilitating a gradual feature modulation in
the latent space from general protein-molecule domain to catalysis-aware
domain. On top of this unified architecture, OmniESI can adapt to a variety of
downstream tasks, including enzyme kinetic parameter prediction,
enzyme-substrate pairing prediction, enzyme mutational effect prediction, and
enzymatic active site annotation. Under the multi-perspective performance
evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, OmniESI
consistently delivered superior performance than state-of-the-art specialized
methods across seven benchmarks. More importantly, the proposed conditional
networks were shown to internalize the fundamental patterns of catalytic
efficiency while significantly improving prediction performance, with only
negligible parameter increases (0.16%), as demonstrated by ablation studies on
key components. Overall, OmniESI represents a unified predictive approach for
enzyme-substrate interactions, providing an effective tool for catalytic
mechanism cracking and enzyme engineering with strong generalization and broad
applicability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Concept-based explainable artificial intelligence (C-XAI) can help reveal the
inner representations of AI models. Understanding these representations is
particularly important in complex tasks like safety evaluation. Such tasks rely
on high-level semantic information (e.g., about actions) to make decisions
about abstract categories (e.g., whether a situation is dangerous). In this
context, it may desirable for C-XAI concepts to show some variability,
suggesting that the AI is capable of generalising beyond the concrete details
of a situation. However, it is unclear whether people recognise and appreciate
such generalisations and can distinguish them from other, less desirable forms
of imprecision. This was investigated in an experimental railway safety
scenario. Participants evaluated the performance of a simulated AI that
evaluated whether traffic scenes involving people were dangerous. To explain
these decisions, the AI provided concepts in the form of similar image
snippets. These concepts differed in their match with the classified image,
either regarding a highly relevant feature (i.e., relation to tracks) or a less
relevant feature (i.e., actions). Contrary to the hypotheses, concepts that
generalised over less relevant features led to ratings that were lower than for
precisely matching concepts and comparable to concepts that systematically
misrepresented these features. Conversely, participants were highly sensitive
to imprecisions in relevant features. These findings cast doubts on whether
people spontaneously recognise generalisations. Accordingly, they might not be
able to infer from C-XAI concepts whether AI models have gained a deeper
understanding of complex situations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of careful engagement with machine companionship as a formal concept or measurable variable, despite its growing presence in social-technological contexts.

Method: A PRISMA-guided scoping review was conducted, systematically sampling, surveying, and synthesizing 71 scholarly works on MC published between 2017 and 2025.

Result: The review found significant variability in how MC is considered, with over 50 distinct measured variables and diverse theoretical frameworks guiding the analysis.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by offering a literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection between humans and machines that develops over time and is subjectively positive.

Abstract: The notion of machine companions has long been embedded in
social-technological imaginaries. Recent advances in AI have moved those media
musings into believable sociality manifested in interfaces, robotic bodies, and
devices. Those machines are often referred to colloquially as "companions" yet
there is little careful engagement of machine companionship (MC) as a formal
concept or measured variable. This PRISMA-guided scoping review systematically
samples, surveys, and synthesizes current scholarly works on MC (N = 71;
2017-2025), to that end. Works varied widely in considerations of MC according
to guiding theories, dimensions of a-priori specified properties (subjectively
positive, sustained over time, co-active, autotelic), and in measured concepts
(with more than 50 distinct measured variables). WE ultimately offer a
literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection
between human and machine that unfolds over time and is subjectively positive.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vocals harmonizers are powerful tools to help solo vocalists enrich their
melodies with harmonically supportive voices. These tools exist in various
forms, from commercially available pedals and software to custom-built systems,
each employing different methods to generate harmonies. Traditional harmonizers
often require users to manually specify a key or tonal center, while others
allow pitch selection via an external keyboard-both approaches demanding some
degree of musical expertise. The AI Harmonizer introduces a novel approach by
autonomously generating musically coherent four-part harmonies without
requiring prior harmonic input from the user. By integrating state-of-the-art
generative AI techniques for pitch detection and voice modeling with
custom-trained symbolic music models, our system arranges any vocal melody into
rich choral textures. In this paper, we present our methods, explore potential
applications in performance and composition, and discuss future directions for
real-time implementations. While our system currently operates offline, we
believe it represents a significant step toward AI-assisted vocal performance
and expressive musical augmentation. We release our implementation on GitHub.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to enable
intuitive control of prosthetic limbs for individuals with upper limb
amputations. However, existing EEG-based control systems face challenges
related to signal noise, classification accuracy, and real-time adaptability.
In this work, we present BRAVE, a hybrid EEG and voice-controlled prosthetic
system that integrates ensemble learning-based EEG classification with a
human-in-the-loop (HITL) correction framework for enhanced responsiveness.
Unlike traditional electromyography (EMG)-based prosthetic control, BRAVE aims
to interpret EEG-driven motor intent, enabling movement control without
reliance on residual muscle activity. To improve classification robustness,
BRAVE combines LSTM, CNN, and Random Forest models in an ensemble framework,
achieving a classification accuracy of 96% across test subjects. EEG signals
are preprocessed using a bandpass filter (0.5-45 Hz), Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) for artifact removal, and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) feature
extraction to minimize contamination from electromyographic (EMG) and
electrooculographic (EOG) signals. Additionally, BRAVE incorporates automatic
speech recognition (ASR) to facilitate intuitive mode switching between
different degrees of freedom (DOF) in the prosthetic arm. The system operates
in real time, with a response latency of 150 ms, leveraging Lab Streaming Layer
(LSL) networking for synchronized data acquisition. The system is evaluated on
an in-house fabricated prosthetic arm and on multiple participants highlighting
the generalizability across users. The system is optimized for low-power
embedded deployment, ensuring practical real-world application beyond
high-performance computing environments. Our results indicate that BRAVE offers
a promising step towards robust, real-time, non-invasive prosthetic control.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical
systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine
learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and
multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs.
This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer
(MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET
decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the
encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE)
layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling
effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a
Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the
input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing
with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient
representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and
multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks
spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA
methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the
potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving
in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future
explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains. This work

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based
on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through
attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation:
foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and
spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers
effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive
Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out
background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on
and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further
introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward
task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is
lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing
ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet,
VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly
improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results,
validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain
adaptation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern
technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness
is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing
approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style
buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and
(ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough
consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the
loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose
MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware
analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD
infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based
generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing
ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the
default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using
open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts
repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves
(maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS)
within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a
commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of
(53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Interactions between modalities -- redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy --
collectively determine the composition of multimodal information. Understanding
these interactions is crucial for analyzing information dynamics in multimodal
systems, yet their accurate sample-level quantification presents significant
theoretical and computational challenges. To address this, we introduce the
Lightweight Sample-wise Multimodal Interaction (LSMI) estimator, rigorously
grounded in pointwise information theory. We first develop a redundancy
estimation framework, employing an appropriate pointwise information measure to
quantify this most decomposable and measurable interaction. Building upon this,
we propose a general interaction estimation method that employs efficient
entropy estimation, specifically tailored for sample-wise estimation in
continuous distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate LSMI's precision and efficiency. Crucially, our sample-wise
approach reveals fine-grained sample- and category-level dynamics within
multimodal data, enabling practical applications such as redundancy-informed
sample partitioning, targeted knowledge distillation, and interaction-aware
model ensembling. The code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference
of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at
shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However,
existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to
formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting
the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on
prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty,
causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To
remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by
considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On
this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the
Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both
logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus
enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE
benchmark show that our method can achieve an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x
across all tasks with negligible performance degradation, surpassing the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConsistentEE by 28%, yielding a better trade-off
between task performance and inference efficiency. The code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for
fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels
(i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of
DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial
examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with
heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength.
In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the
vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations
under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a
fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and
theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the
NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse
perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is
designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property
and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical
performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of
computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to
serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition,
theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser
adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e.,
"obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how
adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent
stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present
significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification
models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM
outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited
applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this
problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot
examples to verify LLM outputs (Referi). Our key idea is to additionally
utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the
target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional
few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, Referi evaluates the generated outputs
by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and
subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and
contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with
three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain
of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its
performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human
preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various
data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the
evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active
querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we
introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically
and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states
throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an
efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each
training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential
generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm,
simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with
minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new
direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of
fixed preference datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently manage a constantly evolving inventory of LLMs while adhering to deployment capacity and cost limits.

Method: StageRoute uses a two-step approach: first, selecting up to M_max models for the next stage with confidence bounds, then solving a budget-constrained bandit problem for query routing.

Result: StageRoute achieves a regret of order T^{2/3} and a matching lower bound, showing near-optimality, with experiments confirming its effectiveness in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: StageRoute is effective for managing LLMs in dynamic environments, offering a balanced approach to deployment and routing under constraints.

Abstract: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear -- and older
ones become obsolete -- forces LLM service providers to juggle a streaming
inventory of models while respecting tight deployment capacity and per-query
cost budgets. We cast the reality as an online decision problem that couples
stage-wise deployment, made at fixed maintenance windows, with per-query
routing among the models kept live. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical
algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_max$ models for the next
stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, then (ii)
solves a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem to route each incoming query. We
prove that StageRoute achieves a regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and provide a
matching lower bound, thereby establishing its near-optimality. Moreover, our
experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating that StageRoute performs close to
the optimum in practical settings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the memory
constraints of edge devices, necessitating extreme weight compression beyond
the 1-bit limit. While quantization reduces model size, it is fundamentally
limited to 1 bit per weight. Existing multiple-to-one compression methods
either rely on mapping tables (inducing memory overhead) or incur severe
accuracy degradation due to random weight grouping. We introduce
UltraSketchLLM, an index-free, sketch-based framework that achieves ultra-low
bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) while preserving model
performance. UltraSketchLLM leverages data sketching, a sub-linear
representation technique from streaming applications, to map multiple weights
to single values with bounded error. Our approach integrates an underestimate
AbsMaxMin sketch to minimize relative errors for small weights,
importance-aware space allocation to prioritize salient weights, and a
straight-through estimator for compression-aware finetuning. Experiments on
Llama-3.2-1B demonstrate up to 0.5-bit compression with competitive perplexity,
alongside tolerable latency overhead. UltraSketchLLM offers a practical
solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Objective: (1) To assess whether ONH biomechanics improves prediction of
three progressive visual field loss patterns in glaucoma; (2) to use
explainable AI to identify strain-sensitive ONH regions contributing to these
predictions.
  Methods: We recruited 237 glaucoma subjects. The ONH of one eye was imaged
under two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated
to ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects
into four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:
(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full
superior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).
Automatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to
compute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.
Biomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning
model. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal
step, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For
each task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area
under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques
were employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each
classification.
  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain
improved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and
inferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions,
contributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive
expansion with increasing disease severity.
  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF
loss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical
region contributing to model predictions.

Motivation: Understanding how memory limitations impact learning and decision-making in unknown environments.

Method: Analyzing MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms under memory constraints to study the trade-off between world model estimation and planning.

Result: The study reveals that memory allocation significantly affects performance in both episodic and continual learning settings.

Conclusion: Optimal memory distribution between model estimation and planning is crucial for agent performance under resource limitations.

Abstract: Resource constraints can fundamentally change both learning and
decision-making. We explore how memory constraints influence an agent's
performance when navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement
learning algorithms. Specifically, memory-constrained agents face a dilemma:
how much of their limited memory should be allocated to each of the agent's
internal processes, such as estimating a world model, as opposed to forming a
plan using that model? We study this dilemma in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms
and examine how different allocations of memory impact performance in episodic
and continual learning settings.

Method: OAT-Rephrase uses a dual-stage pipeline with a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge to rephrase training data based on MeZO dynamics.

Result: Evaluations show OAT-Rephrase improves MeZO performance across multiple tasks and architectures, narrowing or eliminating the gap with first-order methods.

Conclusion: Optimization-aware rephrasing is a effective, low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order optimization (ZO)
offers a memory-efficient alternative to gradient-based methods but suffers
from slower convergence and unstable optimization due to noisy gradient
estimates. This paper introduces OAT-Rephrase, an Optimization-Aware Training
data rephrasing strategy that leverages an LLM to rephrase training instances
based on its understanding of the ZO dynamics, specifically MeZO, derived
directly from its paper. The approach incorporates a dual-stage pipeline
featuring a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge, ensuring all rephrasings retain
task relevance and logical consistency. Evaluations across five classification
tasks and three LLM architectures demonstrate that OAT-Rephrase consistently
improves MeZO fine-tuning performance, often narrowing or eliminating the gap
with first-order methods. Our findings suggest that optimization-aware
rephrasing serves as a reusable and low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order
tuning regimes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize
sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To
mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to
reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear
whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.
Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which
aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the
goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework
that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise
can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level
perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic
embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To
improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes
the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring
the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can
effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned
noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples
can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge
reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved
cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in
fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs
often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to
capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To
address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a
novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through
the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three
complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal
alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene
representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's
sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization
benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations,
indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust
foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring
reliable reasoning and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of safety constraints and explainability in existing RL toolkits, making RL agents more reliable and transparent for real-world applications.

Method: The method involves creating modular wrappers for Gym environments and deep Q-learning agents, integrating constraint enforcement during training and using SHAP values and saliency maps for post-hoc explanations.

Result: The result shows that SafeRL-Lite effectively enforces safety constraints in RL agents and provides visualizations that illustrate policy behavior and safety compliance.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that SafeRL-Lite is a lightweight, extensible library that enhances the safety and interpretability of RL agents, with potential for broader application in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: We introduce SafeRL-Lite, an open-source Python library for building
reinforcement learning (RL) agents that are both constrained and explainable.
Existing RL toolkits often lack native mechanisms for enforcing hard safety
constraints or producing human-interpretable rationales for decisions.
SafeRL-Lite provides modular wrappers around standard Gym environments and deep
Q-learning agents to enable: (i) safety-aware training via constraint
enforcement, and (ii) real-time post-hoc explanation via SHAP values and
saliency maps. The library is lightweight, extensible, and installable via pip,
and includes built-in metrics for constraint violations. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on constrained variants of CartPole and provide visualizations
that reveal both policy logic and safety adherence. The full codebase is

Abstract: We introduce AlgoSelect, a principled framework for learning optimal
algorithm selection from data, centered around the novel Comb Operator. Given a
set of algorithms and a feature representation of problems, AlgoSelect learns
to interpolate between diverse computational approaches. For pairs of
algorithms, a simple sigmoid-gated selector, an instance of the Comb Operator,
facilitates this interpolation. We extend this to an N-Path Comb for multiple
algorithms. We prove that this framework is universal (can approximate any
algorithm selector), information-theoretically optimal in its learnability
(thresholds for selection converge almost surely, demonstrated via
Borel-Cantelli arguments), computationally efficient, and robust. Key
theoretical contributions include: (1) a universal approximation theorem
demonstrating that Comb-based selectors can achieve arbitrary accuracy; (2)
information-theoretic learnability for selection thresholds; (3) formalization
of the Comb Operator within linear operator theory, detailing its boundedness
and spectral properties; (4) an N-Path Comb generalization for multi-algorithm
selection; and (5) a practical learning framework for the adaptive seeding
functions that guide the Comb Operator. Empirical validation on a comprehensive
20$\times$20 problem-algorithm study demonstrates near-perfect selection
(99.9\%+ accuracy) with remarkably few samples and rapid convergence, revealing
that $H(\text{Algorithm}|\text{Problem}) \approx 0$ in structured domains.
AlgoSelect provides a theoretically grounded, practically deployable solution
to automated algorithm selection with provable optimality and learnability
guarantees, with significant implications for AI and adaptive systems.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated code, deepfakes, and other synthetic content is an
emerging research challenge. As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is
increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM
authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel
model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5
encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on
classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a
two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a
probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we
introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs
generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our
model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer
models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3,
Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model
achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely
related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class
attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku,
GPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for
decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features.
However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different
initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not
capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs
on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another
model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's
generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features,
which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal
activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that
trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we
demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs
being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained
on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature
Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on
external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing
model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of
SAE training datasets.

Abstract: The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and
physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy
entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive
interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At
the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to
the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth
optimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social
Metaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which
integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy.
Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14%
compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions.
Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless
and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks,
while ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.

Motivation: To address the limitations of instruction-conditioning in low-capacity models for generating effective dense embeddings.

Method: Introduces MoTE with task-specialized parameters using Task-Aware Contrastive Learning (TaCL).

Result: MoTE shows 64% higher performance gains in retrieval datasets and 43% across all datasets.

Conclusion: MoTE enhances model ability to generate specialized embeddings without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or number of active parameters.

Abstract: Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation
learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for
embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes
fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains
derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and
introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages
task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning
(\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings.
Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in
retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance
gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains
are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or
number of active parameters.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced
the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated
self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a
critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive
computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex
ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined
rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models'
evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive
post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while
maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically,
AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function
that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically
adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting
to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that
balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an
entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets
with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling
adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising
potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success
remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary
limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which
results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the
challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of
generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of
the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct
answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free
framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the
LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal
and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the
high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and
propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable
reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four
general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR
consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,
and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6
points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong
verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points
across seven benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models based on Mixture-of-Experts have achieved substantial

introduces underexplored safety alignment challenges. Existing safety alignment
strategies, predominantly designed for dense models, are ill-suited to address
MoE-specific vulnerabilities. In this work, we formalize and systematically
study MoE model's positional vulnerability - the phenomenon where
safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules, revealing critical
risks inherent to MoE architectures. To this end, we present SAFEx, an
analytical framework that robustly identifies, characterizes, and validates the
safety-critical experts using a novel Stability-based Expert Selection (SES)
algorithm. Notably, our approach enables the explicit decomposition of
safety-critical experts into distinct functional groups, including those
responsible for harmful content detection and those controlling safe response
generation. Extensive experiments on mainstream MoE models, such as the
recently released Qwen3-MoE, demonstrated that their intrinsic safety
mechanisms heavily rely on a small subset of positional experts. Disabling
these experts significantly compromised the models' ability to refuse harmful
requests. For Qwen3-MoE with 6144 experts (in the FNN layer), we find that
disabling as few as 12 identified safety-critical experts can cause the refusal
rate to drop by 22%, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of a small set
of experts on overall model safety.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference

expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To
address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression
framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient
variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our
method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and
transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the
performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this
framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to
create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE
(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of
the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned
on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them
highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments
demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and
remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves
similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated
parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having
significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning
combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating
high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE
architectures. We make our models publicly available at

Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group
representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations.
These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical
groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent
females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic
and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often
require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap,
training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in
large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between
majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from
the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and
improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting
and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that
steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be
effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap,
inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

Abstract: Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in
interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce
a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated
learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs)
approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate
on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated
learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration
enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby
minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model
robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific
learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and
healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate
local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to
centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks,
using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show
that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss
compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research
involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive
features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and
chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of
vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This
approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability
and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on
causes of highly and low interpretable features.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning
capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect''
reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions
are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards
can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To
address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers
the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed
reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning
process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The
injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions,
encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO
with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits
a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar
duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with
ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these
advantages.

extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the
varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity
by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we
propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation
(MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance
textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to
strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a
multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level
representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and
MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in
enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in
emotion recognition. Our code is available at:

### [477] [Neural Total Variation Distance Estimators for Changepoint Detection in News Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18764)
*Csaba Zsolnai,Niels Lörch,Julian Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper uses neural networks and a learning-by-confusion scheme to detect changepoints in news data, effectively identifying major historical events with minimal domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting shifts in public discourse after major events is important for understanding society, but real-world data is complex and noisy.

Method: The method uses neural networks to train classifiers on articles from different time periods, using classification accuracy to estimate total variation distance between distributions, highlighting changepoints.

Result: The method worked on synthetic data and real-world data from The Guardian, finding events like 9/11, COVID-19, and elections.

Conclusion: The approach needs little domain knowledge, finds significant discourse shifts, and provides a quantitative change measure, useful for journalism and policy analysis.

Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial
for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional,
sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging
endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection
in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion
scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in
physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from
different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to
estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions,
where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data
from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events
including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach
requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts
in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content,
making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.

Abstract: Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting
pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides
corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning
the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are
designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to
Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for
stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base
policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not
confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual
learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic
base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and
Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and
compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods,
and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our
learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

TL;DR: This paper discusses security risks in dynamic deep learning systems due to their input-adaptive computation, exploring efficiency attacks and defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for efficient inference in real-world environments with strict latency and resource constraints, dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) have been developed. However, their dynamic nature introduces security risks that are not yet well understood.

Method: The paper investigates the security implications of dynamic behaviors in DDLSs by surveying existing attack strategies and analyzing efficiency vulnerabilities.

Result: The study reveals that current DDLSs have efficiency vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversarial inputs, leading to increased latency, energy consumption, and potential denial-of-service.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need to examine efficiency attacks on modern DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to ensure robustness under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: The growing deployment of deep learning models in real-world environments has
intensified the need for efficient inference under strict latency and resource
constraints. To meet these demands, dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) have
emerged, offering input-adaptive computation to optimize runtime efficiency.
While these systems succeed in reducing cost, their dynamic nature introduces
subtle and underexplored security risks. In particular, input-dependent
execution pathways create opportunities for adversaries to degrade efficiency,
resulting in excessive latency, energy usage, and potential denial-of-service
in time-sensitive deployments. This work investigates the security implications
of dynamic behaviors in DDLSs and reveals how current systems expose efficiency
vulnerabilities exploitable by adversarial inputs. Through a survey of existing
attack strategies, we identify gaps in the coverage of emerging model
architectures and limitations in current defense mechanisms. Building on these
insights, we propose to examine the feasibility of efficiency attacks on modern
DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to preserve robustness under adversarial
conditions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables
for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread
applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have
achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in
long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates
that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series
forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have
shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt
formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual
prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based
time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and
cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified
textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard
prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the
forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal
alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual
information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected
to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3
carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework
for time series forecasting.

Motivation: Traditional experimental techniques for determining stress-strain curves are time-consuming and resource-intensive. This paper aims to provide a more efficient and accurate method using deep learning.

Method: The method involves converting load-displacement data from SPT into images via GAF, then using a Seq2Seq model with LSTM encoder-decoder and multi-head cross-attention for prediction.

Result: The approach achieves a minimum mean absolute error of 0.15 MPa and maximum of 5.58 MPa, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning method offers a promising alternative to conventional experimental techniques, improving the prediction of true stress-strain relationships in materials science.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep-learning approach to predict true
stress-strain curves of high-strength steels from small punch test (SPT)
load-displacement data. The proposed approach uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF)

spatial-temporal features and employs a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model
with an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by multi-head
cross-attention to improved accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves superior prediction accuracy, with minimum and
maximum mean absolute errors of 0.15 MPa and 5.58 MPa, respectively. The

Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models
capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data
sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual
or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex
operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a
novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models
directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming
reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows
for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities,
confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals
within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms,
implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into
logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine
adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal
reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces
enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing
organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and
extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of
PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes.
This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including
manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.

Abstract: Autonomous agents must know how to explore user interfaces (UIs) for reliable
task solving, yet systematic evaluation of this crucial phase is lacking. We
introduce UIExplore-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly dedicated to UI
exploration. The benchmark evaluates agents with either Structured mode
(granting access to layout information like DOM trees) or Screen mode (relying
on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard
interactions) across three levels in a standardized GitLab sandbox environment.
We formalize exploration as the process of maximizing the set of actionable UI
components discovered and propose a metric, human-normalized UI-Functionalities
Observed (hUFO), to quantify the effectiveness of exploration. Our results show
that UIExplore-AlGo achieves the leading mean hUFO scores, reaching up to 77.2%
of human performance in Structured mode and 59.0% in Screen mode at 2,000
steps, particularly excelling at the Sparse level. The results highlight the
relevance of our benchmark, as current agents show a substantial performance
gap compared to one hour of human expert exploration, indicating ample room for
future advancements. We publicly release the benchmark environment, an
exploration dataset, and an evaluation suite to catalyze research into
efficient UI exploration strategies and their downstream applications, such as
experience-driven task completion and automated training data generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find a generative alternative to task-specific fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and requires labeled data.

Method: The method involves using diffusion models to learn the structure of effective task-specific parameter space and generate parameters on demand.

Result: The results show that diffusion models can generate accurate parameters for seen tasks and support multi-task interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that while this approach has potential for generating task-specific parameters, it has limitations in generalizing to unseen tasks.

Abstract: Adapting neural networks to new tasks typically requires task-specific
fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and reliant on labeled data. We explore a
generative alternative that produces task-specific parameters directly from
task identity, eliminating the need for task-specific training. To this end, we
propose using diffusion models to learn the underlying structure of effective
task-specific parameter space and synthesize parameters on demand. Once
trained, the task-conditioned diffusion model can generate specialized weights
directly from task identifiers. We evaluate this approach across three
scenarios: generating parameters for a single seen task, for multiple seen
tasks, and for entirely unseen tasks. Experiments show that diffusion models
can generate accurate task-specific parameters and support multi-task
interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured, but fail to
generalize to unseen tasks, highlighting both the potential and limitations of
this generative solution.

Abstract: While the impact of batch size on generalisation is well studied in vision
tasks, its causal mechanisms remain underexplored in graph and text domains. We
introduce a hypergraph-based causal framework, HGCNet, that leverages deep
structural causal models (DSCMs) to uncover how batch size influences
generalisation via gradient noise, minima sharpness, and model complexity.
Unlike prior approaches based on static pairwise dependencies, HGCNet employs
hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions across training dynamics.
Using do-calculus, we quantify direct and mediated effects of batch size
interventions, providing interpretable, causally grounded insights into
optimisation. Experiments on citation networks, biomedical text, and e-commerce
reviews show that HGCNet outperforms strong baselines including GCN, GAT,
PI-GNN, BERT, and RoBERTa. Our analysis reveals that smaller batch sizes
causally enhance generalisation through increased stochasticity and flatter
minima, offering actionable interpretability to guide training strategies in
deep learning. This work positions interpretability as a driver of principled
architectural and optimisation choices beyond post hoc analysis.

Abstract: Human social behaviour is governed by complex interactions shaped by
uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics. We propose Causal Spherical
Hypergraph Networks (Causal-SphHN), a principled framework for socially
grounded prediction that jointly models higher-order structure, directional
influence, and epistemic uncertainty. Our method represents individuals as
hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, capturing semantic
and relational geometry. Uncertainty is quantified via Shannon entropy over von
Mises-Fisher distributions, while temporal causal dependencies are identified
using Granger-informed subgraphs. Information is propagated through an angular
message-passing mechanism that respects belief dispersion and directional
semantics. Experiments on SNARE (offline networks), PHEME (online discourse),
and AMIGOS (multimodal affect) show that Causal-SphHN improves predictive
accuracy, robustness, and calibration over strong baselines. Moreover, it
enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns and social ambiguity. This
work contributes a unified causal-geometric approach for learning under
uncertainty in dynamic social environments.

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of machine learning
models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining real,
high-quality data can be challenging, especially for smaller organizations and
early-stage startups. Synthetic data generators provide a promising solution by
replicating the statistical and structural properties of real data while
preserving privacy and scalability. This study evaluates the performance of six
tabular synthetic data generators from two widely used open-source libraries:
SDV (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE) and Synthicity (Bayesian Network, CTGAN,
TVAE). Using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
comprising energy consumption and environmental variables from Belgium, we
simulate a low-data regime by training models on only 1,000 rows. Each
generator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two
conditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio.
Evaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured
via classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility,
assessed using a "Train on Synthetic, Test on Real" approach with four
regression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across
models in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case.
The Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both
scenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the
1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two
libraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use,
making it more accessible for practitioners.

Abstract: Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic
forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based
Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses
these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway
selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an
energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence
guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the
stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$
is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using
Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption
scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size.
Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees
against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while
maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory
(GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across
multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning
in energy-constrained settings. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of
strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions.
We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate
strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that
when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the
strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of
Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on
the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches
the underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from
cognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal
adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical
Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token
predictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under
this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior
probability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a
posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework
draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make
explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:
beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing
a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL
phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend
in the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.
Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL
grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

Abstract: Deploying quantized deep neural network (DNN) models with resource adaptation
capabilities on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide
high-quality AI services can leverage the benefits of compression and meet
multi-scenario resource requirements. However, existing dynamic/mixed precision
quantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training
quantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The
state-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes
it challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying
multiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and
switching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly
post-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device
quantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates
the integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into
higher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a
decomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by
adaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In
deployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between
the full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to
resource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the
ImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve
high performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,
storage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101
with INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and
part-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately
78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.

Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time
to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain
shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities
by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen
features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,
solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior
knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16,
performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing
from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP,
this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the
dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side
branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive
knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label
semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion
among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and
visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a
generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive
experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS
and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with
gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for
FMoW.

Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and
as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how
`creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The
score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for
understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain
plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In
particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,
(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we
would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.
However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the
score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself
(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples
that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise
`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role
of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in
this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose
score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that
our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent
arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and
we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using
simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL
on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are
limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While
SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading
policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an
environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using
both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To
ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model
architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning
method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation
Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments

Abstract: Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of
spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and
accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into
actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the
decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can
significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency
response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not
just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive
Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting
paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework
ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby
maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new
Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively
captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,
producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate
actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent
(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms
predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving
optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction
accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to a creation of very successful, but by no means
humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further
exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of
these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel
mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation
of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability. It results
in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning
framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and
answer confidence/reliability measures. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI
tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a set
of synthetic problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method
results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being
very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying
problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models
with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of La Ni\~na and El
Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training
- a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction
tools.

Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the
treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on
clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the
development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial
intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible.
In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give
a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image
view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an
interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed,
considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in
real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete
multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information
between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing
view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order
similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning
between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the
learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the
TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning
mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views,
and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC
dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained
the best results.

Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics
conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in
planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts
remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded
assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not
captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise
as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal
reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive
evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce
a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and
character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and
open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied
Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for
adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient
finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data
compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of
task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong
alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable,
semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous
learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable
probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating
miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to
obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification
performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize
previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,
binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.
Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations
in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a
probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which
theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical
calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective
post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten
identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than
traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,
both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our
learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our
probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable
objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the
correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with
respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical
effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by
achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference
for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand information propagation in Transformer models for better interpretability.

Result: Results show that rare tokens cause larger shifts and deeper layers intermingle input information more.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that first layers can proxy model explanations and token perturbations with embedding shifts are a powerful interpretability tool.

Abstract: Understanding how information propagates through Transformer models is a key
challenge for interpretability. In this work, we study the effects of minimal
token perturbations on the embedding space. In our experiments, we analyze the
frequency of which tokens yield to minimal shifts, highlighting that rare
tokens usually lead to larger shifts. Moreover, we study how perturbations
propagate across layers, demonstrating that input information is increasingly
intermixed in deeper layers. Our findings validate the common assumption that
the first layers of a model can be used as proxies for model explanations.
Overall, this work introduces the combination of token perturbations and shifts
on the embedding space as a powerful tool for model interpretability.

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine
learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks
often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification,
interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a
federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with
a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable
uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment
technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input
features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and
pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods
such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+
offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach
through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with
transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable
uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance
can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+
delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational
overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios.
Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally
efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized
predictive modeling.

Motivation: Neural networks are seen as black boxes, making transparency and reliability a concern. Previous work on ReLU networks aimed to unwrap them into linear models based on activation states, but this approach seeks to improve upon that by providing clearer explanations.

Method: The method involves analyzing subsets of hidden units that contribute to the decision-making process, allowing for more focused and flexible explanations of how inputs affect outputs.

Result: The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing ones in both quantitative and qualitative measures, indicating better performance in explaining neural network decisions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the pathwise explanation method provides a clearer and more consistent understanding of the input-decision relationship in ReLU networks, with improved flexibility and detailed decomposition of explanations.

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated a wide range of successes, but their
``black box" nature raises concerns about transparency and reliability.
Previous research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into
linear models based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved
in the decision making path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and
more consistent understanding of the relationship between the input and the
decision-making process. Our method also offers flexibility in adjusting the
range of explanations within the input, i.e., from an overall attribution input
to particular components within the input. Furthermore, it allows for the
decomposition of explanations for a given input for more detailed explanations.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms others both quantitatively
and qualitatively.

Motivation: Standard meta learning approaches focus on expected loss, but this work aims to address task variability by prioritizing high-loss tasks for better performance in worst-case scenarios.

Method: The paper adopts a distributionally robust optimization paradigm, which differs from standard meta learning by focusing on high-loss tasks rather than the average loss.

Result: The proposed approach was evaluated on a meta model trained on synthetic dynamical systems and showed reduced failures in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: By prioritizing high-loss tasks, the distributionally robust minimization in meta learning enhances performance in worst-case scenarios, making it suitable for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Meta learning aims at learning how to solve tasks, and thus it allows to
estimate models that can be quickly adapted to new scenarios. This work
explores distributionally robust minimization in meta learning for system
identification. Standard meta learning approaches optimize the expected loss,
overlooking task variability. We use an alternative approach, adopting a
distributionally robust optimization paradigm that prioritizes high-loss tasks,
enhancing performance in worst-case scenarios. Evaluated on a meta model
trained on a class of synthetic dynamical systems and tested in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, the proposed approach allows
to reduce failures in safety-critical applications.

Motivation: To highlight the importance of reliable uncertainty estimation in medical classification and to address the misconceptions about the applicability of conformal predictions in critical domains.

Method: The paper uses examples from dermatology and histopathology to demonstrate the limitations of conformal predictions under distributional shifts and evaluates their performance in different scenarios.

Result: Conformal predictions are shown to be unreliable when there are distributional shifts in input or label variables, and they are not effective for selecting predictions to enhance accuracy or for analyzing subsets of data.

Conclusion: Practitioners should be cautious about using conformal predictions in medical classification, especially in scenarios with distributional shifts, small number of classes, or when focusing on subsets of data.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical
classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the
statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention,
due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the
application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine
comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be
aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology
that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input
and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for
selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of
the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in
classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in
medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited
practical value.

Abstract: We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert
demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework
for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as
sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and
a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive
backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals
only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision
length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward
signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by
conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate
regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more
than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks
with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to
generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that
our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are
otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we
find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone
cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to
partial solutions.

Abstract: Linear State Space Models (SSMs) offer remarkable performance gains in
efficient sequence modeling, with constant inference-time computation and
memory complexity. Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with
input-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as
strong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However,
efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of
Experts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter
or degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel
approach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection
experts. By sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight
sub-modules within Mamba across experts, RoM leverages synergies among linear
projection experts for effective and efficient sparse scaling of Mamba layers.
At a scale of 1.3B active parameters (10B total) and 16K training sequence
length, RoM achieves language modeling performance equivalent to a dense Mamba
model requiring over 2.3x more active parameters, and demonstrates consistent
perplexity across context lengths. Experimental results further show RoM
effectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared
to dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing diffusion samplers, particularly the high variance and limited scalability of annealing approaches that rely on importance sampling.

Method: NAAS is a novel SOC-based diffusion sampler that uses annealed reference dynamics without importance sampling, employing a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint matching for efficient training.

Result: The approach is effective for sampling from classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distributions.

Conclusion: NAAS provides a more efficient and scalable solution for diffusion sampling by avoiding the pitfalls of importance sampling while leveraging annealed dynamics.

Abstract: Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion
samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods
typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased
stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process,
or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling.
Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward
high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance
and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the
\textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based
diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting
to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint
matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from
classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development
of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains
before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance,
controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a
steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific
reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic
experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several
reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing
uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in
reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear
directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering
vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to
modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its
tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical
tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and
interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using two
DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different
model architectures.

Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a
way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal
new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred
features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty
of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we
evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component
tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of
task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep
learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks
fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during
training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during
pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and
perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training
mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this
phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data
distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation
learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely
on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific
training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a
potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,
present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards
addressing this challenge.

Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO)
model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary
activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce
Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges
of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by
discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach
preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while
allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers,
thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide
theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising
spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk
minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge
in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO)
model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing
the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of
penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem,
increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality.
To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD)
algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO
problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with
randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited
precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an
upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental
results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on
the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.

Abstract: Conventional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods employ a fixed rank, imposing
uniform adaptation across transformer layers and attention heads despite their
heterogeneous learning dynamics. This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic
LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through
learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective
balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$
sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank
transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank
adaptation. Experiments on LLAMA-3.1-70B and PaliGemma-2 demonstrate ARD-LoRA's
efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with only 0.32%
trainable parameters, outperforming strong baselines like DoRA and AdaLoRA.
Furthermore, it reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%. These results
establish dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation as a critical paradigm for
efficient foundation model adaptation.

Abstract: Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research,
leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly
challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and
identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these
two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear
transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple
order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG
(ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple
linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed
data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based
kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs.
By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous
optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural
properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the
ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We
evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that
ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and
zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed
for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable

Abstract: Neural ray tracing (RT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for channel
modeling by combining physical propagation principles with neural networks. It
enables high modeling accuracy and efficiency. However, current neural RT
methods face two key limitations: constrained generalization capability due to
strong spatial dependence, and weak adherence to electromagnetic laws. In this
paper, we propose GeNeRT, a Generalizable Neural RT framework with enhanced
generalization, accuracy and efficiency. GeNeRT supports both intra-scenario
spatial transferability and inter-scenario zero-shot generalization. By
incorporating Fresnel-inspired neural network design, it also achieves higher
accuracy in multipath component (MPC) prediction. Furthermore, a GPU-tensorized
acceleration strategy is introduced to improve runtime efficiency. Extensive
experiments conducted in outdoor scenarios demonstrate that GeNeRT generalizes
well across untrained regions within a scenario and entirely unseen
environments, and achieves superior accuracy in MPC prediction compared to
baselines. Moreover, it outperforms Wireless Insite in runtime efficiency,
particularly in multi-transmitter settings. Ablation experiments validate the
effectiveness of the network architecture and training strategy in capturing
physical principles of ray-surface interactions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based
policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety
risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for
revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust
autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they
still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks,
yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and
temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting
attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training
due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we
propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both
the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first
derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation
learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for
robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a
DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the
diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we
further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces
reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms
of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in
cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental
problem across scientific and engineering domains. While deep learning has
demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior,
achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable
remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured
Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates
structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).
SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function
approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual
sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable
quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent
representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of
KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing
dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the
Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to
refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered
equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE
achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent
models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.

Motivation: To enhance the connection between flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, providing a scalable framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation in molecules.

Method: Deriving a controlled generation objective in VFM, implementing controlled generation through end-to-end training of conditional models or Bayesian inference, and creating an equivariant VFM formulation for molecular generation.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled molecular generation and outperformed existing models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and Bayesian inference.

Conclusion: The work bridges flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a principled framework for generating molecules with constraints and symmetry awareness.

Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of
Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational
inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented
two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models,
or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of
unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the
conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant
formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to
rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both
uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art
models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the
Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between
flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and
principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a key task for artificial intelligence due to it's role
in major downstream tasks such as Question Answering, Summarization. Recent
methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly
converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical
formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards
this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to
learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a
consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference
optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune
open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms
GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14%
less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics,
we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by
better representing them in their logical formulations.

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis and monitoring rely increasingly on high-throughput image

evolving cellular patterns and quantify uncertainty in real time. We introduce
Adaptive and Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Clustering, a novel streaming-capable
framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network-based feature extraction
with an online fuzzy clustering engine. ADNF initializes soft partitions via
Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and
fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy
evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and
entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the
C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of
0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The
method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate
potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network,
enabling scalable, up-to-date support for personalized leukemia management.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models for decision-making
requires high-quality training data. However, access to real-world datasets is
often restricted due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and
incomplete data availability. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has
emerged as a viable alternative, enabling the creation of artificial datasets
that preserve the statistical properties of real data while ensuring privacy
compliance. Despite its advantages, synthetic data is often overly clean and
lacks real-world imperfections, such as missing values, noise, outliers, and
misclassified labels, which can significantly impact model generalization and
robustness. To address this limitation, we introduce Pucktrick, a Python
library designed to systematically contaminate synthetic datasets by
introducing controlled errors. The library supports multiple error types,
including missing data, noisy values, outliers, label misclassification,
duplication, and class imbalance, offering a structured approach to evaluating
ML model resilience under real-world data imperfections. Pucktrick provides two
contamination modes: one for injecting errors into clean datasets and another
for further corrupting already contaminated datasets. Through extensive
experiments on real-world financial datasets, we evaluate the impact of
systematic data contamination on model performance. Our findings demonstrate
that ML models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained
on purely synthetic, error-free data, particularly for tree-based and linear
models such as SVMs and Extra Trees.

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural
networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal
evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous
mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity
during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework
leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both
deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three
principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows,
induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of
parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the
randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii)
the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of
parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such
as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch
sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the
Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate
strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed
behaviors.

Abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time
diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods
typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which
only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive
simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from
the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which
jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the
dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To
accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and
density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly
simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables
simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from
data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal
transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,
with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of
accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of
application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal
dynamics from population data.

Abstract: Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally
relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up
in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest
in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands
through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We
present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL
algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a
grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of
binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks
that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing
the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able
to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They
outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand
three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for
further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.

Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel
K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced
with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on
point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in
accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally,
the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further
exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data
points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball
computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of
granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from
coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a
density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves
the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises.
Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the
granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel
K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball
relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows
its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical
evaluation of various clustering tasks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in machine
learning (ML), offering privacy-preserving collaborative model training across
diverse datasets. Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in
non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where
most existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack
robustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration
(FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these
challenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL
methods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios
in which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It
employs a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a
global guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters.
This matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in
subsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the
global model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent
in non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since
only a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a
strong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the
need for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client
scenario. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the art FL algorithms
demonstrate significant improvements in performance, particularly under
realistic non-IID conditions, thus highlighting FedLEx's potential to overcome
critical barriers in diverse FL applications.

Abstract: Prior work on the learnability of transformers has established its capacity
to approximate specific algorithmic patterns through training under restrictive
architectural assumptions. Fundamentally, these arguments remain data-driven
and therefore can only provide a probabilistic guarantee. Expressivity, on the
contrary, has theoretically been explored to address the problems
\emph{computable} by such architecture. These results proved the
Turing-completeness of transformers, investigated bounds focused on circuit
complexity, and formal logic. Being at the crossroad between learnability and
expressivity, the question remains: \emph{can transformer architectures exactly
simulate an arbitrary attention mechanism, or in particular, the underlying
operations?} In this study, we investigate the transformer encoder's ability to
simulate a vanilla attention mechanism. By constructing a universal simulator
$\mathcal{U}$ composed of transformer encoders, we present algorithmic
solutions to identically replicate attention outputs and the underlying
elementary matrix and activation operations via RASP, a formal framework for
transformer computation. Our proofs, for the first time, show the existence of
an algorithmically achievable data-agnostic solution, previously known to be
approximated only by learning.

Abstract: Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated

uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To
better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the
relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates
the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We
propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random
variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol
indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is
validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification
problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across

label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data
distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware
solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework
that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to
detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate
shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and
implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate
mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical
analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation
compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The
proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for
FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing

smallest variance among all asymptotically normal, regular estimators of the
DiD and ES parameters. Leveraging the EIF, we propose simple-to-compute

pre-treatment periods and comparison groups to obtain the tightest (asymptotic)
confidence intervals, offering practical tools for improving inference in
modern DiD and ES applications even in small samples. Calibrated simulations

Abstract: The wisdom of crowds is an umbrella term for phenomena suggesting that the
collective judgment or decision of a large group can be more accurate than the
individual judgments or decisions of the group members. A well-known example
illustrating this concept is the competition at a country fair described by
Galton, where the median value of the individual guesses about the weight of an
ox resulted in an astonishingly accurate estimate of the actual weight. This
phenomenon resembles classical results in probability theory and relies on
independent decision-making. The accuracy of the group's final decision can be
significantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few
influential agents.
  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess
uncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world.
Assume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple
non-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the
French-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this
iterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic
estimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate
determined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every
agent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state
of the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights
allocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents
must then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined
by the available sets of influence weights. We characterize both the Pareto
frontier and the set of Nash equilibria in the resulting game. Additionally, we
examine asynchronous best-response dynamics for the group of agents and prove
their convergence to the set of strict Nash equilibria.

Abstract: Keyword Spotting plays a critical role in enabling hands-free interaction for

scalability and adaptability challenges of traditional systems by enabling
recognition of custom keywords with only a few examples. However, existing
FS-KWS systems achieve subpar accuracy at desirable false acceptance rates,
particularly in resource-constrained edge environments. To address these
issues, we propose a training scheme that leverages self-supervised learning
models for robust feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and knowledge
distillation. The teacher model, based on Wav2Vec 2.0 is trained using
Sub-center ArcFace loss, which enhances inter-class separability and
intra-class compactness. To enable efficient deployment on edge devices, we
introduce attention-based dimensionality reduction and train a standard
lightweight ResNet15 student model. We evaluate the proposed approach on the
English portion of the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus (MSWC) and the Google
Speech Commands (GSC) datasets. Notably, the proposed training method improves
the 10-shot classification accuracy from 33.4% to 74.1% on 11 classes at 1%
false alarm accuracy on the GSC dataset, thus making it significantly
better-suited for a real use case scenario.

this``synthetic perception" can yield significant performance gains, even when
augmenting strong large language model baselines. However, we find the
effectiveness of this approach is highly conditional, depending critically on
the semantic alignment between text and the generated image, the inherent
``visual groundability" of the task, and the generative fidelity of the T2I
model. Our work establishes the first rigorous benchmark for this paradigm,

real-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous
temporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful
applications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus
on preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order
group interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world
networks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static
homogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in
HTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order
interaction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of
heterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge
construction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a
novel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to
fully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs. HTHGN contains a hierarchical
attention mechanism module that simultaneously performs temporal
message-passing between heterogeneous nodes and hyperedges to capture rich
semantics in a wider receptive field brought by hyperedges. Furthermore, HTHGN
performs contrastive learning by maximizing the consistency between low-order
correlated heterogeneous node pairs on HTG to avoid the low-order structural
ambiguity issue. Detailed experimental results on three real-world HTG datasets
verify the effectiveness of the proposed HTHGN for modeling high-order
interactions in HTGs and demonstrate significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Accurate geological modeling is critical for reservoir characterization, yet
traditional methods struggle with complex subsurface heterogeneity, and they
have problems with conditioning to observed data. This study introduces
Pix2Geomodel, a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)
framework based on Pix2Pix, designed to predict reservoir properties (facies,
porosity, permeability, and water saturation) from the Rotliegend reservoir of
the Groningen gas field. Utilizing a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the
Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, accessed via EPOS-NL, the methodology
included data preprocessing, augmentation to generate 2,350 images per
property, and training with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator over
19,000 steps. Evaluation metrics include pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection
over union (mIoU), frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), and
visualizations assessed performance in masked property prediction and
property-to-property translation tasks. Results demonstrated high accuracy for
facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with
moderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74,
FWIoU 0.60), and robust translation performance (e.g., facies-to-facies PA
0.98, FWIoU 0.97). The framework captured spatial variability and geological
realism, as validated by variogram analysis, and calculated the training loss
curves for the generator and discriminator for each property. Compared to
traditional methods, Pix2Geomodel offers enhanced fidelity in direct property
mapping. Limitations include challenges with microstructural variability and 2D
constraints, suggesting future integration of multi-modal data and 3D modeling
(Pix2Geomodel v2.0). This study advances the application of generative AI in
geoscience, supporting improved reservoir management and open science
initiatives.
