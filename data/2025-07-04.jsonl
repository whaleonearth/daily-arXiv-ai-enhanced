Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination.

This is particularly relevant for\nstudents in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement\nin distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in\ndifferent online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the\nnon-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based\nuniversity. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that\ncould be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning\nalgorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction\naccuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning\nframework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the\ntrained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\\%,\nwhere about 85\\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the\nhighly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a\ndiscussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement\nfrom voluntary tasks in online learning."}

To overcome this gap, we\nintroduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a\ncollaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data\nquality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.\nFirst, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected\nvideos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,\nwater turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,\nto ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,\nresolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and\nterrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where\nobservation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and\nenvironmental.

Moreover,\ndesigning effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a\nbarrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce\nSciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific\npapers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA\nselection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA\ngeneration. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two\ntasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given\npaper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,\nwhich retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose\nConfidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation\nmetric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses\nlimitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where\nmultiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also\nserve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a\nfoundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to\nthe development of AI for Science."}

The vessel is parametrized as\ncenterlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity\nby construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape\nparameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.\nOur method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as\ndemonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and\nbrain vessels."}

To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,\na modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,\nexplanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks.

However, arterial cannulation in small\nanimals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,\nprecluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully\nconvolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions\ndirectly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling\nin dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial\nfeature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,\nextracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a\ntemporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The\nproposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood\ncurves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model\napplicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected\nusing two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The\nmodel was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate\nshorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts\nthe arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.\nFurthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function\neven from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF\nfrom samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not\nrepresented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers\na non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving\nrobust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations."}

Project page: https://lgcnsai.github.io/apt", "summary": "Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant\nchallenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of\ntext alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction\ndistribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose\nsemantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training\n(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive\ntraining strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations\nduring fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training\nAdjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of\noverfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and\nadaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation\nStabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature\nmaps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention\nAlignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention\nmaps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain\nprior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior\nknowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse\nimages with limited reference data."}
